The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so we can use this to solve the problem. If the area Diablo wants is less than or equal to the square of the length of the fencing Anthony has, then it is possible for Anthony to build his cage. Otherwise, he will need more materials.", "A, N = map(float, input().split())\nif A <= N**2:\n    print(\"Diablo is happy\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Need more materials\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a simple comparison of the area of the cage (A) and the area of the available fencing (N^2). If the area of the cage is less than or equal to the area of the available fencing, then it is possible to build the cage, and the program outputs \"Diablo is happy\". Otherwise, the program outputs \"Need more materials\".", "A, N = map(float, input().split())\nif A <= N**2:\n    print(\"Diablo is happy\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Need more materials\")\n\n\nThis code first takes in the area Diablo wants and the amount of fencing Anthony has. It then checks if the area Diablo wants is less than or equal to the square of the amount of fencing Anthony has. If it is, then it prints \"Diablo is happy\". If it is not, then it prints \"Need more materials\".\n\nThis is because the area of a square is the square of one of its sides, so if Anthony has enough fencing, he can", "A, N = map(float, input().split())\nif A <= N:\n    print(\"Diablo is happy\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Need more materials\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program takes in two inputs, A and N. It then checks if A is less than or equal to N. If it is, it prints \"Diablo is happy\". If not, it prints \"Need more materials\".", "A, N = map(float, input().split())\nif A <= N**2:\n    print(\"Diablo is happy\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Need more materials\")\n\n\nThis code works by first getting the input for the area (A) and the amount of fencing (N) from the user. Then it checks if the area A is less than or equal to the square of N. If it is, it prints \"Diablo is happy!\". If it is not, it prints \"Need more materials!\".\n\nThis is because the area of a square is the square of the side length, and the side length of a square can be calculated by"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAnthony has a pet hamster named Diablo. Diablo enjoys having lots of space to move around, so Anthony wants to build him a cage that covers as much area as possible.\n\nHowever, Diablo also likes to dig and hide very much, and when he does, it is an absolute pain for Anthony to find Diablo (Diablo is very good at hiding). Therefore, Anthony wants to make sure the cage he builds for Diablo is not too big. In particular, Anthony wants to make sure the area of the cage is exactly $A$ square meters; any area larger than $A$ square meters will be too much work to find Diablo when he hides, any area smaller than $A$ square meters will be too uncomfortable for Diablo.\n\nAnthony has $N$ meters of fencing that can be cut/bent at any point, and wonders if it is possible to build a cage of any shape that has area exactly $A$ with the materials he has. Write a program to help him out!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains two real numbers $0<A\\leq 100$ and $0\\leq N\\leq 1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with \u201cDiablo is happy!\u201d if Anthony can build his cage for Diablo, \u201cNeed more materials!\u201d otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1.000000 4.000000\nSample Output:\nDiablo is happy!\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
