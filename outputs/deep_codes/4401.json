We first store the value of one variable in a temporary variable, then we store the value of the other variable in the first variable, and finally we store the value stored in the temporary variable in the other variable.\n\nThis program reads the values of X, Y, and Z from the input, and assigns them to the variables A, B, and C, respectively. Then it swaps the values of A and B, and the values of A and C. Finally, it prints the contents of the boxes A, B, and", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Swap the contents of the boxes A and B\nX, Y = Y, X\n\n# Swap the contents of the boxes A and C\nX, Z = Z, X\n\nprint(X, Y, Z)\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's multiple assignment feature to swap the values of variables X, Y, and Z. The input values are read from the standard input, and the swapped values are printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution works by first swapping the values of X and Y, then swapping the values of X and Z. The final values of X, Y, and Z are the contents of the boxes A, B, and C, respectively, after the operations.\n\nThis solution is efficient and runs in O(1) time, as it performs a constant number of operations.", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nA, B, C = Z, X, Y\nprint(A, B, C)\n\n\nThis code takes in the inputs for X, Y, and Z. It then assigns the values of Z to A, X to B, and Y to C. Finally, it prints out the values of A, B, and C.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input will be in the correct format (i.e., three integers separated by spaces), and that the input values will be within the constraints (1 <= X,Y,Z <= 100).\n\nThis code does not include any error checking to ensure that the input is valid. If you want to include error checking, you would need to add additional code to check that the input values are indeed integers and that they are within the given range.", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nA, B, C = Z, X, Y\nprint(A, B, C)\n\n\nThis code takes the input X, Y, Z. Then it assigns the values of Z to A, X to B and Y to C. Finally, it prints the values of A, B, C.\n\nThis is because when we swap the contents of A and B, A becomes B and B becomes A, and when we swap the contents of A and C, A becomes C and C becomes A. So, the final values of A, B, C are the values of Z, X, Y respectively.\n\nThis code works as long as the inputs are within the constraints (1 \u2264 X,Y,Z \u2264 100).\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\nX, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nA, B, C = Z, X,"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have three boxes A, B, and C, each of which contains an integer.\n\nCurrently, the boxes A, B, and C contain the integers X, Y, and Z, respectively.\n\nWe will now do the operations below in order.
