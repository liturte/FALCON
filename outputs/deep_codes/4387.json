It reads the rating of Takahashi from the input, then checks if it is less than 1200, and if it is, it prints \"ABC\". If it is not less than 1200 but less than 2800, it prints \"ARC\". If it is not less than 2800, it prints \"AGC\".\n\nThe solution is efficient because it uses a simple if-elif-else statement to check the conditions and print the corresponding contest name. It also uses the built-in `int` function to convert the input to an integer, and the `input` function to read the input from the user.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), because it always executes the same number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of extra"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA programming competition site AtCode regularly holds programming contests.\nThe next contest on AtCode is called ABC, which is rated for contestants with ratings less than 1200.\nThe contest after the ABC is called ARC, which is rated for contestants with ratings less than 2800.\nThe contest after the ARC is called AGC, which is rated for all contestants.\nTakahashi's rating on AtCode is R.
