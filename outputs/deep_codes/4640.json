One of the possible ways is to place the first platform between points $(1, -1)$ and $(2, -1)$ and the second one between points $(4, 3)$ and $(5, 3)$. Vectors represent how the points will fall down. As you can see, the only point we can't save is the point $(3, 7)$ so it falls down infinitely and will be lost. It can be proven that we can't achieve better answer here. Also note that the point $(5, 3)$ doesn't fall at all because it is already on the platform.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
