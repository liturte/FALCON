This is calculated by finding the area of the remaining cake after the cuts are made, and then multiplying that area by the thickness of the cake (4 cm).\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $a^2 = s^2/2$, where $a$ is the side length and $s$ is the length of the sides. Since the sides of the cake are equal, the side length is $n$ and the length", "def birthday_cake_candles(n, h, v):\n    return (n - h) * (n - v) * 4\n\nn, h, v = map(int, input().split())\nprint(birthday_cake_candles(n, h, v))\n\n\nThis Python code works by first defining a function `birthday_cake_candles` which takes three parameters: the length of the sides of the square cake `n`, the distance of the horizontal cut `h`, and the distance of the vertical cut `v`. The function calculates the volume of the largest piece of cake after the cuts are made by multip", "n, h, v = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the area of the four pieces of cake after the cuts\npiece1 = h * v * 4\npiece2 = (n - h) * v * 4\npiece3 = h * (n - v) * 4\npiece4 = (n - h) * (n - v) * 4\n\n# The volume of the cake is the total area of the cake multiplied by the thickness\nvolume = (n * n * 4) - (piece1 + piece2 + piece3 + piece4)\n\nprint(volume)\n\n\nThis code works by first reading the input and storing the", "n, h, v = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the area of each piece of cake\nhorizontal_piece = h * v * 4\nvertical_piece = (n - h) * v * 4\nother_piece = h * (n - v) * 4\n\n# The biggest piece of cake is the one with the largest area\nprint(max(horizontal_piece, vertical_piece, other_piece))\n\n\nThis code reads the input values for n, h, and v.

It calculates the volume of the largest piece of cake after the horizontal and vertical cuts are made by subtracting the cut distances from the length of the side of the cake and multiplying the result by 4 (for the thickness"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIt is Greg\u2019s birthday! To celebrate, his friend Sam invites Greg and two other friends for a small party. Of course, every birthday party must have cake.\n\nSam ordered a square cake. She makes a single horizontal cut and a single vertical cut. In her excitement to eat cake, Sam forgot to make these cuts through the middle of the cake.\n\nOf course, the biggest piece of cake should go to Greg since it is his birthday. Help Sam determine the volume of the biggest piece of cake that resulted from these two cuts.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing three integers $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10000$), the length of the sides of the square cake in centimeters, $h$ ($0 < h < n$), the distance of the horizontal cut from the top edge of the cake in centimeters, and $v$ ($0 < v < n$), the distance of the vertical cut from the left edge of the cake in centimeters. This is illustrated in the figure above.\n\nEach cake is $4$ centimeters thick.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the volume (in cubic centimeters) of the largest of the four pieces of cake after the horizontal and vertical cuts are made.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n10 4 7\nSample Output 1:\n168\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 2 2\nSample Output 2:\n36\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
