Let's briefly look at the Gapja system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.\n\nThere are two sequences of $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_{n}$ and $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_{m}$. These strings contain only lowercase letters. There might be duplicates among these strings.\n\nLet's call a concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$ as the string that is obtained by writing down strings $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings \"code\" and \"forces\" is the string \"codeforces\".\n\nThe year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings $s_1$ and $t_1$. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences. If the string that is currently being used is at the end of its sequence, we go back to the first string in that sequence.\n\nFor example, if $n = 3, m = 4, s = ${\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, $t =$ {\"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"}, the following table denotes the resulting year names. Note that the names of the years may repeat. [Image] \n\nYou are given two sequences of strings of size $n$ and $m$ and also $q$ queries. For each query, you will be given the current year.
