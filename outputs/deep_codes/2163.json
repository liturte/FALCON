It constructs an array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of distinct subsequences of length `i`. The base case is `dp[0] = 1` (the empty subsequence). For each number `i` from 1 to `m`, it updates `dp[i]` as twice the value of `dp[i]` plus the value of `dp[i-1]` (since the number `i` can be added to the subsequences of length `i-1` or not).

The state dp[i] represents the number of subsequences of length i. \n\nThe transition from state i to state i + 1 is straightforward: for each number x in the range 1 to m, we have dp", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ndp = [0] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 1\ncum = [0] * (m + 1)\ncum[0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, m + 1):\n    dp_new = dp[:]\n    for j in range(i, n + 1):\n        dp_new[j] = (dp_new[j] + dp_new[j - 1]) % MOD\n    cum_new = cum[:]\n    for j in range(i, n + 1):\n        cum_new[j] = (cum_new[j - 1] + dp_new[j]) % MOD\n    dp, cum = dp_new, cum_new\nprint(cum[n])\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.\n\nFirstly, it initializes two lists dp and cum with all elements as 0. dp[i] is the number of subsequences of length i and cum[i] is the sum", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef solve(n, m):\n    fact = [0]*(n+m+1)\n    factinv = [0]*(n+m+1)\n    fact[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+m+1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1]*i)%MOD\n    factinv[-1] = pow(fact[-1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(n+m, -1, -1):\n        factinv[i] = (factinv[i+1]*(i+1))%MOD\n    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for _ in range(1, m+1):\n        ndp = dp[:]\n        for i in range(n, -1, -1):\n            ndp[i] = (ndp[i] + dp[i-1] if i-1>=0 else 0) % MOD\n        dp = ndp\n    return (sum(dp)*(pow(m, n,", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef solve(n, m):\n    dp = [0]*(m+1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]*2%MOD\n    for _ in range(1, n):\n        for i in range(m, 0, -1):\n            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-1])%MOD\n    return sum(dp)%MOD\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, m))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a dynamic programming problem.\n\nWe use a list `dp` to store the number of subsequences for each possible length `i`.\n\nFor each `i`, we calculate `dp[i]` as `dp[i-1]*2%MOD`, because for each new number `i`, we can either add it to all the existing subsequences or not add it.\n\nFinally, we return the sum of all `dp[i]`s"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFor a sequence a of n integers between 1 and m, inclusive, denote f(a) as the number of distinct subsequences of a (including the empty subsequence).\n\nYou are given two positive integers n and m.
