This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.\n\nLesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array A.\n\nThe next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array A.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise in the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k\u00a0\u2014 the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 \u2264 i < k. \n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 -3\n\nOutput\nYES\n2\n1 2\n3 3\n\nInput\n8\n9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n2\n1 2\n3 8\n\nInput\n1\n0\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 -5\n\nOutput\nYES\n4\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
