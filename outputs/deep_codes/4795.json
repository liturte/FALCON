Help the teacher by writing a program that will, for given $N$ integers from $P_1$ to $P_ N$ determine and output the value of $X$ from the original task.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10$), the number of the addends from the task. Each of the following $N$ lines contains the integer $P_ i$ ($10 \\leq P_ i \\leq 9999$, $i = 1, \\ldots , N$) from the task.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the value of $X$ ($X \\leq 1000000000$) from the original task.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n212\n1253\nSample Output 1:\n1953566\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n23\n17\n43\n52\n22\nSample Output 2:\n102\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
