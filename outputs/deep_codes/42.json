For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 40$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the target string $t$.\n\nThe next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$.
