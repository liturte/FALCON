For other 10 pairs one jump is enough. So, the answer is 5\u00b72 + 10\u00b71 = 20.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly. There are 3 pairs of vertices (s < t), so the answer is 3\u00b71 = 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
