{"625": {"code": ["n = int(input())\nprint((-1)**n * n)\n\n\nThis Python program uses the mathematical property of the alternating series to calculate the value of f(n). The alternating series is a series of numbers where the sign alternates between positive and negative. In this case, the series is (-1) + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + ... + n. The Python program takes an input n and calculates the value of the series up to n. The result is then printed.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output.", "print((-1)**n*n)", "print((-1)**n*n)", "def f(n):\n    return (-1)**n * n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(f(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe function f(n) calculates the sum of the series (-1)^n * n. The nth term of the series is (-1)^n * n. The sum of the first n terms of this series is then (-1)^n * (n * (n + 1) / 2). This sum is simplified to n * (1 - (-1)^n).\n\nThis simplified formula is used in the definition of the function f(n). The function returns the value of n * (1 - (-1)^n). The value of (-1)^n is either -1 or 1, depending on whether n is even or odd, respectively. Therefore, the function f(n) returns n if n is even, and -n if n is odd.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input and converted to an integer. The function f(n) is then called with this input, and the result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThe result of the function f(n) is the value of the series sum for the nth term.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a positive integer, as specified in the problem statement.
