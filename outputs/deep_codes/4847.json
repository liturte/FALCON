The land contains N apple trees, but his piece is triangular and it is not easy for him to determine which apple trees belong to him.\n\nYour program will be given the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle forming Ante\u2019s piece, and the coordinates of all apple trees. Determine the area of land belonging to Ante, and the number of trees belonging to him. We consider apple trees on the very border of his piece to belong to him.\n\nThe area of a triangle with vertices $(x_ A, y_ A), (x_ B, y_ B)$ and $(x_ C, y_ C)$ is given by the following formula:\\[ \\frac{|x_ A(y_ B - y_ C) + x_ B(y_ C - y_ A) + x_ C(y_ A - y_ B)|}{2} \\]\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first three lines contain the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nThe following line contains the integer $N$ $(1 \\le N \\le 100)$, the number of apple trees.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains the coordinates of one apple tree.\n\nAll coordinate are pairs of positive integers less than 1000, separated by a space.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the area of land belonging to Ante on the first line, with exactly one digit after the decimal point.\n\nOutput the number of trees belonging to Ante on the second line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 1\n5 1\n3 3\n4\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n3 4\nSample Output 1:\n4.0\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 2\n5 4\n1 6\n3\n2 4\n3 5\n4 3\nSample Output 2:\n6.0\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
