Each problem, once prepared, also has to be printed.\n\nThe preparation of a problem on day i (at most one per day) costs a_{i} CHF, and the printing of a problem on day i (also at most one per day) costs b_{i} CHF. Of course, a problem cannot be printed before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of preparation and printing?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2200). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_{n} ($1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^{9}$) \u2014 the preparation costs. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, ..., b_{n} ($1 \\leq b_{i} \\leq 10^{9}$) \u2014 the printing costs.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the minimum cost of preparation and printing k problems \u2014 that is, the minimum possible sum a_{i}_1 + a_{i}_2 + ... + a_{i}_{k} + b_{j}_1 + b_{j}_2 + ... + b_{j}_{k}, where 1 \u2264 i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{k} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j_1 < j_2 < ... < j_{k} \u2264 n and i_1 \u2264 j_1, i_2 \u2264 j_2, ..., i_{k} \u2264 j_{k}.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n8 4\n3 8 7 9 9 4 6 8\n2 5 9 4 3 8 9 1\n\nOutput\n32\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the sample testcase, one optimum solution is to prepare the first problem on day 1 and print it on day 1, prepare the second problem on day 2 and print it on day 4, prepare the third problem on day 3 and print it on day 5, and prepare the fourth problem on day 6 and print it on day 8.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
