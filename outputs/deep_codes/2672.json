We can solve it by calculating the power of 3 from 1 to X and storing the results in an array. Then we can use this array to calculate the result. The result is calculated by subtracting 3 times the power of 3 of the previous X-1 elements from the power of 3 of the current X and adding the power of 3 of the previous X-1 elements. All the calculations are done modulo 1000000007 to prevent overflow.\n\nThe code is written in Python and it takes an integer X as input, calculates the result using the solve function and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that this code doesn't provide a detailed explanation of how it works. For a detailed explanation, please refer to the problem statement.\n\nThis code is efficient and can handle large inputs in a reasonable time. The time complexity is O(X) and the space complexity is O(X).\n\nPlease replace the 'X' in the input function with the actual input you want to use", "def solve(x):\n    return (3 * pow(3, x - 1, 10**9+7)) % (10**9+7)\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem can be solved using modular arithmetic and exponentiation by squaring. The formula for the sum of the first n cubes is 3 * n^2. To compute the sum of the first X cubes modulo 10^9+7, we need to compute 3^X modulo 10^9+7. \n\nHowever, direct calculation of 3^X for large X can be very slow. Instead, we can use exponentiation by squaring to speed up the calculation. The formula for exponentiation by squaring is:\n\n    if n is even: a^n = (a^(n/2))^2\n    if n is odd: a^n = a * (a^((n-1)/2))^2\n\nThis formula allows us to compute a^n in O(log n) time, which is much faster than direct calculation for large n.\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3 and take the result modulo 10^9+7 to get the final answer.\n\nThe pow function in Python can be used with three arguments to compute a^n modulo m. The third argument is the modulus, and the function returns a^n modulo m.\n\nNote: The pow function in Python is optimized for large numbers and can handle large exponentiations quickly.\n\nAlso note that the modulus", "def solve(X):\n    return (3 * pow(2, X, 1000000007)) % 1000000007\n\nX = int(input())\nprint(solve(X))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find the three times the result of 2 raised to the power of X, modulo 1000000007. The pow function in Python can be used to calculate the power and the modulus operator (%) can be used to find the remainder of the division.\n\nThe pow function also has a third argument which is the modulus. This means it will calculate the power and then find the remainder of the result when divided by the given modulus. This is a more efficient way to calculate the power and the modulus at the same time.\n\nThe input is read using the input function and converted to an integer using the int function. The solve function is then called with this input and the result is printed.\n\nThe solution is correct because 3 * 2^X is the formula for calculating the number of three-element subsets of a set with X elements. The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer.\n\nThis solution runs in constant time, O(1), because it does not depend on the size of the input.\n\nThe solution uses the pow function with a third argument to calculate the power and the modulus at the same time. This is more efficient than calculating the power first and then calculating the modulus, because the modulus operation can be very expensive if the", "def solve(X):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    f = [0]*(X+1)\n    f[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, X+1):\n        f[i] = (f[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    return (f[X] * pow(f[X-1], MOD-2, MOD)) % MOD\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\n\nThis code uses the formula for permutations with repetitions, which is `nPr = n^r * (n-1)^(r-1) * (n-2)^(r-2) * ...`. Since we are looking for the number of ways to choose three elements from a set of size `n`, we can simplify this formula to `n^3 * (n-1)^(3-1) * (n-2)^(3-2) * ...`.\n\nThe code calculates the factorial of `n` and `n-1` and then uses modular inverse to calculate the inverse of `(n-1)!`. The result is then multiplied together to get the number of ways to choose three elements from a set of size `n`.\n\nThe modulo operation is used to keep the result within the range of a 32-bit integer. The modulo inverse is calculated using the Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is a valid integer and that the input is less than 10^5.\n\nPlease note that", "def solve(X):\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    if X < 4:\n        return X\n    res = 1\n    base = 3\n    while X:\n        if X & 1:\n            res = res * base % MOD\n        X >>= 1\n        base = base * base % MOD\n    return res\n\nX = int(input())\nprint(solve(X))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is about bit manipulation and modular arithmetic. The key is to understand that the result of a power operation can be calculated by repeatedly squaring the base and reducing the exponent by half in each step, just like in binary exponentiation. However, instead of reducing the exponent by half at each step, we should reduce the result of the operation by the modulo 1000000007 at each step to avoid overflow. This is why we have the line `res = res * base % MOD` in the code.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows: if X is odd, we multiply the current result by 3 and update X to X-1. If X is even, we square the base and update X to X/2. We continue this process until X becomes 0. The final result is the current result.\n\nThe complexity of this algorithm is O(log X), which is enough for the constraints of the problem.\n\nThe code provided is a Python solution for the problem.\n\nPlease note that the function `solve` is a helper function that performs the calculations.
