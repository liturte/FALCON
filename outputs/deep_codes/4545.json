If the input could be invalid, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nThe solution also assumes that the input is given as two separate lines, with the first line containing N and the second line containing A. If the input is given in a different format, additional processing would be needed to extract N and A.\n\nThe solution is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. It's often used for its readability and simplicity, and its wide range of libraries and tools.\n\nThe solution uses the built-in `input` function to read the input from the user, the `int` function to convert the input to an integer, and the `print` function to output the result. The `-` operator is used to subtract A from N*N to get the number of black squares.\n\nThe solution is simple and does not include any unnecessary complexity or features. It directly solves the problem as described", "N = int(input())\nA = int(input())\nprint(N*N - A)\n\n\nThis Python program will take inputs for N and A, then calculate and print the number of squares that will be painted black. The calculation is done by subtracting A from the total number of squares (N*N).\n\nThis solution is based on the problem statement.
