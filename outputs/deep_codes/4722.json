This is because we can distribute the cookies in pairs, with each pair consisting of one cookie from the first tin and one cookie from the second tin. If the product of the number of cookies in each tin is even, then we can always find a way to distribute the cookies in this way.\n\nFor example, if A = 4 and B = 5, then the product is 4 * 5 = 20. If we distribute the 20 cookies in pairs, each of the three goats can have 20 / 3 = 6 cookies. So, the answer is yes.\n\nIf the product of the number of cookies in each tin is not even, then we cannot distribute the cookies in such a way that each of the three goats gets the same number of cookies.\n\nThe code", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A % 3 == 0 or B % 3 == 0 or (A + B) % 3 == 0:\n    print('Possible')\nelse:\n    print('Impossible')\n\n\nThis code works by taking in the input and splitting it into two variables, A and B. It then checks if either A, B, or the sum of A and B is divisible by 3. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'Possible', otherwise it prints 'Impossible'.\n\nThe reason this works is because if A or B is divisible by 3, then they can be evenly divided among the three goats. If their sum is divisible by 3, then the remaining cookies can be evenly distributed among the three goats.\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------------------------\n# Code by: Md.

It then checks if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 'Possible', otherwise it prints 'Impossible'. This is because if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3, it means that the number of cookies given out is a multiple of 3, which means that each of the three goats can have the same number of cookies.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the total number of cookies given out must be a multiple of 3 for each of the three goats to have the same number of cookies.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only performs a fixed number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and output.\n\nThe code is written in Python 3. It can be run in any environment that supports Python 3.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Possible' if A * 2 % 3 == 0 or B * 2 % 3 == 0 or (A + B) % 3 == 0 else 'Impossible')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by using number theory.\n\nIf we look at the constraints, we can see that A and B are integers and are less than or equal to 100. This means that the maximum number of cookies Snuke can have is 100 * 2 = 200.\n\nNow, we can consider all the possible cases for the number of cookies each goat can have. If any of the following conditions are true, we can give cookies so that each goat can have the same number of cookies:\n\n1. A * 2 is divisible by 3 (A * 2 % 3 == 0).\n2. B * 2 is divisible by 3 (B * 2 % 3 == 0).\n3. A + B is divisible by 3 ((A + B) % 3 == 0).\n\nIf any of these conditions are true, we print \"", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A * B >= 3:\n    print('Possible')\nelse:\n    print('Impossible')\n\n\nThis code works by first reading in two integers A and B from the input. Then it checks if the product of A and B is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it prints \"Possible\". Otherwise, it prints \"Impossible\". This is because the total number of cookies Snuke can give is A*B. If this is less than 3, Snuke cannot give enough cookies to all three goats.\n\nThis solution assumes that the three goats each need to receive the same number of cookies. If that is not the case, the code would need to be adjusted accordingly."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke is giving cookies to his three goats.\nHe has two cookie tins.
