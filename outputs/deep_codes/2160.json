Note that $(4,5)$ is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.\n\nIn the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.\n\nIn the last example, all $(i,j)$ where $|i-j| \\leq 1$ except for $(42, 42)$ are valid scenarios.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
