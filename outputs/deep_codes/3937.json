GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b.\n\nYou have a sequence of positive integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = a_{l} for all 1 \u2264 l \u2264 k.\n\nDetermine if the sequence a occurs in table G.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^12; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10000). The second line contains k space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^12).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single word \"YES\", if the given sequence occurs in table G, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n100 100 5\n5 2 1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n100 8 5\n5 2 1 2 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n100 100 7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nSample 1. The tenth row of table G starts from sequence {1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 10}. As you can see, elements from fifth to ninth coincide with sequence a.\n\nSample 2. This time the width of table G equals 8. Sequence a doesn't occur there.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
