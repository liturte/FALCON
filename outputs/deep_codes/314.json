Bran like candies so much, so Arya is going to give him some Candies.\n\nAt first, Arya and Bran have 0 Candies. There are n days, at the i-th day, Arya finds a_{i} candies in a box, that is given by the Many-Faced God. Every day she can give Bran at most 8 of her candies. If she don't give him the candies at the same day, they are saved for her and she can give them to him later.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day. Formally, you need to output the minimum day index to the end of which k candies will be given out (the days are indexed from 1 to n).\n\nPrint -1 if she can't give him k candies during n given days.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10000).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible for Arya to give Bran k candies within n days, print -1.\n\nOtherwise print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n1 2\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n3 17\n10 10 10\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n1 9\n10\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Arya can give Bran 3 candies in 2 days.\n\nIn the second sample, Arya can give Bran 17 candies in 3 days, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day.\n\nIn the third sample, Arya can't give Bran 9 candies, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day and she must give him the candies within 1 day.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
