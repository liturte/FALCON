{"3738": {"code": ["def", "a", "def", "x", "a"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string s. Each character of s is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:  'U': go up, (x, y)  \u2192  (x, y+1);  'D': go down, (x, y)  \u2192  (x, y-1);  'L': go left, (x, y)  \u2192  (x-1, y);  'R': go right, (x, y)  \u2192  (x+1, y). \n\nThe robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in (a, b).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b, ( - 10^9 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^9). The second line contains a string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100, s only contains characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') \u2014 the command.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" if the robot will be located at (a, b), and \"No\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\nRU\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n1 2\nRU\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n-1 1000000000\nLRRLU\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n0 0\nD\n\nOutput\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first and second test case, command string is \"RU\", so the robot will go right, then go up, then right, and then up and so on.\n\nThe locations of its moves are (0, 0)  \u2192  (1, 0)  \u2192  (1, 1)  \u2192  (2, 1)  \u2192  (2, 2)  \u2192  ...\n\nSo it can reach (2, 2) but not (1, 2).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
