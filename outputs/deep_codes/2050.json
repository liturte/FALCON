Define S to be of rank k if and only if for all pairs of distinct elements s_{i}, s_{j} from S, $\\operatorname{gcd}(s_{i}, s_{j}) = k$.\n\nGiven k and n, Dreamoon wants to make up n sets of rank k using integers from 1 to m such that no integer is used in two different sets (of course you can leave some integers without use). Calculate the minimum m that makes it possible and print one possible solution.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains two space separated integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the first line print a single integer \u2014 the minimal possible m. \n\nOn each of the next n lines print four space separated integers representing the i-th set.\n\nNeither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimal m, print any one of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\n5\n1 2 3 5\n\nInput\n2 2\n\nOutput\n22\n2 4 6 22\n14 18 10 16\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example it's easy to see that set {1, 2, 3, 4} isn't a valid set of rank 1 since $\\operatorname{gcd}(2,4) = 2 \\neq 1$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
