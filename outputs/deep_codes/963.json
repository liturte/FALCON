He is trying to reach Cell N by using the procedure described below.\nYou are given an integer K that is less than or equal to 10, and K non-intersecting segments [L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\ldots, [L_K, R_K].\nLet S be the union of these K segments.\nHere, the segment [l, r] denotes the set consisting of all integers i that satisfy l \\leq i \\leq r.\n - When you are on Cell i, pick an integer d from S and move to Cell i + d. You cannot move out of the cells.\nTo help Tak, find the number of ways to go to Cell N, modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1\u00a0\\leq K \\leq \\min(N, 10)\n - 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N\n - [L_i, R_i] and [L_j, R_j] do not intersect (i \\neq j) \n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\nL_1 R_1\nL_2 R_2\n:\nL_K R_K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of ways for Tak to go from Cell 1 to Cell N, modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 2\n1 1\n3 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\nThe set S is the union of the segment [1, 1] and the segment [3, 4], therefore S = \\{ 1, 3, 4 \\} holds.\nThere are 4 possible ways to get to Cell 5:\n - 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5,\n - 1 \\to 2 \\to 5,\n - 1 \\to 4 \\to 5 and\n - 1 \\to 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
