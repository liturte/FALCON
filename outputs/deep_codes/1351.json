{"1351": {"code": ["def find_number(l, r):\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if len(set(str(i))) == len(str(i)):\n            return i\n    return -1\n\nl, r = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_number(l, r))\n\n\nThis python code takes in two integers $l$ and $r$ from the user. It then checks all the numbers between $l$ and $r$ to see if all their digits are different. If it finds such a number, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it returns $-1$.\n\nThe function `find_number` uses a for loop to iterate through each number in the range from $l$ to $r$. It converts each number to a string, and checks if the length of the string is equal to the length of the set of the string. A set in python is a collection of unique elements. So if the length of the string and the length of the set of the string are the same, it means all", "def find_num(l, r):\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if len(str(i)) == len(set(str(i))):\n            return i\n    return -1\n\nl, r = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_num(l, r))\n\nIn this code, we define a function `find_num` that takes two parameters `l` and `r`. It iterates through each number in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive). For each number, it converts it to a string and checks if the length of the string is equal to the length of the set of characters in the string. If they are equal, it means all digits in the number are different, so it returns the number. If no such number is found in the range, it returns `-1`.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input to integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings, and `map` applies the `int` function to", "def find_number(l, r):\n    for x in range(l, r+1):\n        if len(set(str(x))) == len(str(x)):\n            return x\n    return -1\n\nl, r = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_number(l, r))\n\n\nThis code first defines a function `find_number` that takes two integers `l` and `r` as input. It then loops through all numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive), converts each number to a string, creates a set from the string (which removes duplicate characters), and checks if the length of the set is the same as the length of the string. If they are the same, it means that all digits are different, so it returns the number. If no such number is found after checking all numbers, it returns `-1`.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input to integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input by spaces, and `map` converts each part to an integer", "l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef is_distinct(n):\n    return len(set(str(n))) == len(str(n))\n\nfor x in range(l, r+1):\n    if is_distinct(x):\n        print(x)\n        break\nelse:\n        print(-1)\n\n\nThis python code checks each number in the range from $l$ to $r$ inclusive. It uses a helper function `is_distinct` to check if all the digits of a number are distinct by converting the number to a string, creating a set from the string (which removes duplicates), and comparing the length of the string and the set. If the lengths are the same, all the digits are distinct. If the number is not distinct, it continues to the next number in the range. If it reaches the end of the range without finding a number with distinct digits, it prints $-1$.\n\nThis code runs in O(n) time where n is the size of the range.\n\nThis code assumes that the input", "l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef is_distinct(n):\n    return len(set(str(n))) == len(str(n))\n\nfor x in range(l, r+1):\n    if is_distinct(x):\n        print(x)\n        break\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n\n\nThis program works by iterating over all integers between $l$ and $r$ (inclusive), and checking if each one has distinct digits. If it does, it prints that number and stops. If it doesn't find any such number, it prints $-1$. The `is_distinct` function converts the integer to a string, creates a set from the string (which removes duplicates), and checks if the length of the set is the same as the length of the string (i.e., all the digits were distinct).\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of $O((r-l+1)n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits in $r$. In the worst"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have two integers $l$ and $r$. Find an integer $x$ which satisfies the conditions below:\n\n  $l \\le x \\le r$.

However, $121$ can't be the answer, because there are multiple $1$s on different digits.\n\nIn the second example, there is no valid answer.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
