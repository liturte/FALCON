You have to construct an m-free square matrix of size n \u00d7 n such that the number of 1's in this matrix is maximum possible. Print the maximum possible number of 1's in such matrix.\n\nYou don't have to solve this problem. Instead, you have to construct a few tests for it.\n\nYou will be given t numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t}. For every $i \\in [ 1, t ]$, find two integers n_{i} and m_{i} (n_{i} \u2265 m_{i}) such that the answer for the aforementioned problem is exactly x_{i} if we set n = n_{i} and m = m_{i}.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tests you have to construct.\n\nThen t lines follow, i-th line containing one integer x_{i} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\nNote that in hacks you have to set t = 1.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test you have to construct, output two positive numbers n_{i} and m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n_{i} \u2264 10^9) such that the maximum number of 1's in a m_{i}-free n_{i} \u00d7 n_{i} matrix is exactly x_{i}. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them; and if this is impossible to construct a test, output a single integer  - 1. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n21\n0\n1\n\nOutput\n5 2\n1 1\n-1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
