Then it calculates the total number of segments by summing the segments for each digit from `a` to `b`. Note that we subtract 1 from `a` because we start counting from 0.\n\nThis solution assumes that all digits are displayed, which means that the number of segments printed is always the same, regardless of whether the number is a single digit or a multiple digit number. If the number is a multiple digit number, then the number of segments printed will be the maximum number of segments for any digit in the number.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution", "def total_segments(a, b):\n    numbers = {\n        '0': 6,\n        '1': 2,\n        '2': 5,\n        '3': 5,\n        '4': 4,\n        '5': 5,\n        '6': 6,\n        '7': 3,\n        '8': 7,\n        '9': 6\n    }\n\n    return sum(numbers[str(i)] for i in range(a, b + 1))\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(total_segments(a, b))\n\n\nIn this solution, we first create a dictionary where the keys are the digits from 0 to 9 and the values are the number of segments required to display each digit.

After typing each number Max resets the calculator. Find the total number of segments printed on the calculator.\n\nFor example if a = 1 and b = 3 then at first the calculator will print 2 segments, then \u2014 5 segments and at last it will print 5 segments. So the total number of printed segments is 12.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers a, b (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the first and the last number typed by Max.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer a \u2014 the total number of printed segments.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 3\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n10 15\n\nOutput\n39\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
