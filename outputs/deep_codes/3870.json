The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack \"ATK 2000\" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the \"DEF 1700\" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.\n\nIn the second test case, she should use the \"1001\" card to attack the \"ATK 100\" card, then use the \"101\" card to attack the \"ATK 10\" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.\n\nIn the third test case note that she can destroy the \"ATK 0\" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a \"DEF 0\" card with that card.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
