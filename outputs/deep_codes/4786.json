After doing some research, she discovered that most tech companies in her area use an algorithm to prescreen resumes by scanning for certain keywords before the resume is even seen by a human. Any resume that does not contain sufficiently many technology-related keywords is automatically rejected!\n\nCatherine has devised a plan to outwit the prescreening algorithm: she intends to cram as many keywords as possible into her resume to maximize her chances of passing the prescreening process. As a first step, she has downloaded a list of the most common tech buzzwords from an online data bank that includes entries such as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201cBig data\u201d, \u201cAI\u201d, \u201cC++\u201d, \u201cNeural-network\u201d, \u201cunix\u201d, \u201ccryptography\u201d, etc. (Note that keyword sometimes really means keyphrase.)\n\nIn the early stages of drafting her new resume, Catherine notices that many keywords from the data bank are very similar to each other (e.g., \u201cMachine-learning\u201d vs. \u201cmachine learning\u201d, or \u201cMySQL\u201d vs. \u201cMySql\u201d). Since she suspects that including nearly identical keywords won\u2019t help her fool the prescreening algorithm, she wants to filter out such similar keywords in order to save room on her resume. Catherine considers two keywords $k_1$ and $k_2$ to be similar if, after replacing hyphens with spaces and ignoring capitalization, $k_1$ is the same as $k_2$.\n\nCan you help Catherine craft the perfect resume to land her a job?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer, $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 40000)$, the number of keywords in the data bank. This is followed by $n$ lines, each of which contains a keyword string $k$ that is between $1$ and $25$ characters in length (inclusive).
