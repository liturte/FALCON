You need to paint elements in colors, so that:   If we consider any color, all elements of this color must be divisible by the minimal element of this color.  The number of used colors must be minimized. \n\nFor example, it's fine to paint elements $[40, 10, 60]$ in a single color, because they are all divisible by $10$.
