Otherwise, it prints the first K characters of S followed by '...'.\n\nFor example, if K=7 and S='nikoandsolstice', the code prints 'nikoand...'.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input string S consists only of lowercase English letters and that K is a positive integer.

It then checks if the length of the string S is less than or equal to K. If it is, the string S is printed out directly. If not, the code slices the first K characters of S and appends \"...\" to the end. The result is printed out.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that K is always greater than 0, as the problem statement specifies that K is an integer between 1 and 100.

If the length of S is greater than K, it returns the first K characters of S followed by \"...\". Otherwise, it returns S as is. The test case demonstrates how to use this function by calling it with the values 7", "K = int(input())\nS = input()\n\nif len(S) <= K:\n    print(S)\nelse:\n    print(S[:K] + \"...\")\n\n\nThis Python code reads an integer K and a string S from the standard input, checks if the length of S is less than or equal to K, and prints S if it is. If the length of S exceeds K, it prints the first K characters in S followed by ....\n\nThis solution is pure Python code and does not require any additional libraries. It uses the built-in functions int() to read the integer K, input() to read the string S, and len() to determine the length of S. It uses slicing to extract the first K characters in S, and the + operator to concatenate these characters with ....\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(K), as it reads K characters from the string S. The space complexity is also O(K), as it stores K characters in the output string.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\nK = int(input())\nS = input()\n\nif len(S) <= K:\n    print("], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.\nIf the length of S is at most K, print S without change.\nIf the length of S exceeds K, extract the first K characters in S, append ... to the end of them, and print the result.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - K is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n - S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.\n - The length of S is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nK\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a string as stated in Problem Statement.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n7\nnikoandsolstice\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nnikoand...\n\nnikoandsolstice has a length of 15, which exceeds K=7.\nWe should extract the first 7 characters in this string, append ... to the end of them, and print the result nikoand....\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
