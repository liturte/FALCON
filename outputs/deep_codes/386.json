The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.\n\nThe rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer y and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:  Is it true that y is strictly larger than number x?  Is it true that y is strictly smaller than number x?  Is it true that y is larger than or equal to number x?  Is it true that y is smaller than or equal to number x? \n\nOn each question the host answers truthfully, \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nGiven the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of y that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print \"Impossible\".\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of questions (and answers). Next n lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: \"sign x answer\", where the sign is:  \">\" (for the first type queries),  \"<\" (for the second type queries),  \">=\" (for the third type queries),  \"<=\" (for the fourth type queries). \n\nAll values of x are integer and meet the inequation  - 10^9 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9. The answer is an English letter \"Y\" (for \"yes\") or \"N\" (for \"no\").\n\nConsequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint any of such integers y, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number y must meet the inequation  - 2\u00b710^9 \u2264 y \u2264 2\u00b710^9. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n>= 1 Y\n< 3 N\n<= -3 N\n> 55 N\n\nOutput\n17\n\nInput\n2\n> 100 Y\n< -100 Y\n\nOutput\nImpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
