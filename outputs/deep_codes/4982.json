The value of $x$ is no greater than the number of shares owned before the event.\n - \u201csplit $x$\u201d: The stock split with $x$ new shares for each share.\n - \u201cmerge $x$\u201d: The stock merged with one new share for every $x$ shares.\n - \u201cdie $y$\u201d: The remaining shares were sold off at the death of Mittens for $y$ crowns per share.
