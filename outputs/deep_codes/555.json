Then it iterates over each digit in the string. For each digit, it calculates the minimum possible digit to replace it with (either the original digit or 9 minus the original digit, whichever is smaller). It then converts these calculated digits back to strings and concatenates them to form the minimum possible number. Finally, it converts the resulting string back to an integer and returns it.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input number will always be a positive integer and will not contain leading zeroes. If this is not the case, you would need to add additional error checking and handling code.\n\nAlso, please note that this code may not work correctly for large input numbers due to the limitations of Python's built-", "def min_possible_number(x):\n    x = str(x)\n    min_num = \"\"\n    for digit in x:\n        if int(digit) >= 5:\n            min_num += str(9 - int(digit))\n        else:\n            min_num += digit\n    return int(min_num)\n\nprint(min_possible_number(int(input())))\n\n\nThis code works by converting the input number to a string. Then, it iterates over each digit in the string. If the digit is 5 or greater, it's inverted by subtracting it from 9 and appended to the result string. If the digit is less than 5, it's appended to the result string as is. Finally, the result string is converted back to an integer and returned.\n\nThis code assumes that the input number will be a positive integer and will not contain leading zeroes. If the input number might contain leading zeroes, you would need to handle that separately.\n\nNote: This code works for numbers up to 10^18 (one quadrillion) because Python can handle arbitrarily large integers. If", "def min_invertible(x):\n    s = str(x)\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] != '9':\n            return int(s[:i] + '9' + s[i+1:])\n    return int(s[:-1] + '9')\n\nprint(min_invertible(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code first converts the input number into a string. Then it iterates over the string, checking each digit. If the digit is not 9, it replaces it with 9 and returns the resulting number as an integer. If all digits are 9, it replaces the last digit with 9 and returns the resulting number as an integer.\n\nThis solution works because the goal is to replace the largest possible number of 9's with 0's to minimize the number. The only exception is if the number starts with a 9, in which case we replace the first 9 with a 0 and the rest with 9's.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not", "def min_possible_number(x):\n    return int(''.join(min(a, b) for a, b in zip(str(x), '9' * len(str(x))) if a != '0'))\n\nprint(min_possible_number(int(input())))\n\n\nThis solution works by converting the number to a string, then iterating over the string and the string '9' * len(str(x)). For each pair of characters in the strings, it chooses the smaller one (unless the first character is '0', in which case it chooses the second character). It then joins the characters back together into a string and converts it back to an integer.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a valid positive integer. If the input could be invalid, the code would need to be modified to handle the error.", "x = input()\nprint(int(x.translate(str.maketrans('0123456789', '9876543210'))))\n\n\nThis code works by using the built-in `str.translate` function in python which is used to replace specified characters. The `str.maketrans` function returns a translation table that can be used with the `str.translate` function to replace specified characters. In this case, it's being used to replace each digit with its inverted digit. The result is then converted back to an integer and printed.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input will be a string, and it will work correctly if the input is a string of digits. If the input is a number, it can be converted to a string using the `str` function.\n\nFor example:\n\nx = int(input())\nprint(int(str(x).translate(str.maketrans('0123456789', '9876543210'))))\n\nThis version of the code will work correctly even if the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLuke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number x.
