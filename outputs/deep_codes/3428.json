Given integers $1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n$, we define $f(i, j)$ as $\\gcd (a_ i, a_{i+1}, \\dots , a_{j-1}, a_ j)$. \n\nAbout a century later Lothar Collatz applied this function to the sequence $1, 1, 1, \\dots , 1$, and observed that $f$ always equalled $1$. Based on this, he conjectured that $f$ is always a constant function, no matter what the sequence $a_ i$ is. This conjecture, now widely known as the Collatz Conjecture, is one of the major open problems in botanical studies. (The Strong Collatz Conjecture claims that however many values $f$ takes on, the real part is always $\\frac{1}{2}$.)\n\nYou, a budding young cultural anthropologist, have decided to disprove this conjecture. Given a sequence $a_ i$, calculate how many different values $f$ takes on.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two lines.\n - A single integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$, the length of the sequence.\n - The sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_ n$. It is given that $1 \\leq a_ i \\leq 10^{18}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line containing a single integer, the number of distinct values $f$ takes on over the given sequence.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n9 6 2 4\nSample Output:\n6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
