His Sensei chooses a new favorite number every day. The pupil wants to put a name on his nametag that encodes his Sensei\u2019s favorite number! This name will consist of only lower case letters. He assigns a value to each letter, based on its position in the alphabet (e.g. $\\texttt{a}=1$, $\\texttt{b}=2$, ..., $\\texttt{z}=26$). Then, he encodes the Sensei\u2019s number by adding up the absolute values of the differences of every consecutive pair of letters. For example, the string $\\texttt{azxb}$ has the value of:\\[ |\\texttt{a} - \\texttt{z}| + |\\texttt{z} - \\texttt{x}| + |\\texttt{x} - \\texttt{b}| = |1 - 26| + |26 - 24| + |24 - 2| = 49 \\]\n\nThe name that the ninja will write on his nametag is the shortest string that encodes to his Sensei\u2019s favorite number. If there\u2019s more than one string of the shortest length, he\u2019ll choose the one that comes first alphabetically. Given the Sensei\u2019s favorite number, $k$, find the string that the ninja should put on his nametag.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input consists of a single line with a single integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 1000000$), which is the Sensei\u2019s favorite number. There will always be a name that encodes to the Sensei\u2019s number.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with a string of lower case letters, which is the name that the ninja should put on the nametag to impress the Sensei.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1\nSample Output 1:\nab\n\nSample Input 2:\n19\nSample Output 2:\nat\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
