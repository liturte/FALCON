For example, the sequences 1,3,5 and 1,2,3 are subsequences of 1,2,3,4,5, while 3,1,2 and 1,10,100 are not.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq a_i \\leq n\n - Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.\n - n and a_i are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nn\na_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint n+1 lines.\nThe k-th line should contain the number of the different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 2 1 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n5\n4\n1\n\nThere are three subsequences with length 1: 1 and 2 and 3.\nThere are five subsequences with length 2: 1,1 and 1,2 and 1,3 and 2,1 and 2,3.\nThere are four subsequences with length 3: 1,1,3 and 1,2,1 and 1,2,3 and 2,1,3.\nThere is one subsequence with length 4: 1,2,1,3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
