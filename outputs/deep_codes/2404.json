{"2404": {"code": ["def f(a):\n    return (a-1)**2\n\nprint(f(int(input())))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is about calculating the square of the number minus one. The function f(a) = (a-1)^2 is used to calculate the answer. The input is read using the built-in function `input()`, which reads a line from input (stdin), converts it into a string, and returns that string. The `int()` function is used to convert this string into an integer. The result is then printed using the built-in function `print()`.\n\nThe reason this works is because the problem statement is asking for the square of the number minus one, which is equivalent to (a-1)^2 in mathematical terms. This is a common trick in programming problems that involve manipulating numbers, as it allows you to simplify the problem into a simple mathematical operation.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is always a valid integer. If you need to handle invalid inputs, you would need to add error checking code to handle that.", "def calculate(a):\n    return (a*2)**2\n\nprint(calculate(int(input())))\n\n\nThe function `calculate` takes an integer `a` as an argument. It multiplies `a` by 2 and then squares the result. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThe input is read as a string and converted to an integer using the `int` function. The result of the `calculate` function is then printed to the console.\n\nThis solution assumes that the problem statement is correct and that the input will always be a valid integer.", "def solve(a):\n    return (a**2)%100\n\nprint(solve(35))\nprint(solve(57))\nprint(solve(391))\n\n\nThis problem is a simple modular arithmetic problem. The modulus of a square of a number is the square of the modulus of the number, so we can just square the input and take the modulus of 100.\n\nIn Python, you can do this with the `%` operator, which gives the remainder of division. So `a**2 % 100` will give the remainder of `a**2` divided by 100.\n\nThe `solve` function takes an integer `a` as input and returns the remainder of `a**2` divided by 100. The `print` statements at the end call this function with the inputs from the problem statement.", "def solve(a):\n    return a*a\n\nprint(solve(35))\nprint(solve(57))\nprint(solve(391))\n\n\nThis program will take a number as input and return the square of that number. The square of a number is the number multiplied by itself.

This is because the problem statement simply states that the output is the double of the input.\n\nFor example, if the input is `35`, the function returns `70`, if the input is `57`, the function returns `114`, and so on.\n\nNote: This solution is based on the assumption that the problem statement is correct and does not require any additional processing or calculations.\n\n\n-----Hint-----\nThe problem statement is quite simple and does not require any complex programming. The solution is as follows:\n\n1. Input the integer.\n2. Multiply the integer by 2.\n3. Output the result.\n\nThis can be implemented in any programming language.\n\nThe function `solve(a)` is the Python equivalent of this process. It takes an integer `a` as input and returns `a` multiplied by `2`.\n\nThe problem statement does not specify any conditions or requirements that would require additional processing or calculations."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere was once young lass called Mary,  \n\nWhose jokes were occasionally scary.  \n\nOn this April's Fool  \n\nFixed limerick rules  \n\nAllowed her to trip the unwary.\n\n\n\nCan she fill all the lines\n\nTo work at all times?\n\nOn juggling the words\n\nRight around two-thirds\n\nShe nearly ran out of rhymes.\n\n\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains a single integer $a$ ($4 \\le a \\le 998$).
