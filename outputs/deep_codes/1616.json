Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.\n\nA sequence $a$ is a subsequence of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of $a$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$, $a_{n}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array $a$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of $a$ product of whose elements is a perfect square. If there are several shortest subsequences, you can find any of them. If there's no such subsequence, print \"-1\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 4 6\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n4\n2 3 6 6\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n3\n6 15 10\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n4\n2 3 5 7\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, you can choose a subsequence $[1]$.\n\nIn the second sample, you can choose a subsequence $[6, 6]$.\n\nIn the third sample, you can choose a subsequence $[6, 15, 10]$.\n\nIn the fourth sample, there is no such subsequence.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
