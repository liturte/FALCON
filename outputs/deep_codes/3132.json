The location can be modeled as a grid of $R \\cdot C$ square cells. For each of the cells, archeologists have determined if some building was there or if the cell has always been empty.\n\nAfter examining the artifacts in detail, they concluded that the location contains two buildings from different periods in time, and that the floor plans of both buildings are of square shape.\n\nBecause the buildings were from different periods in time, it is possible that their floor plans overlap. Determine the possible location and size (length of the side of the square occupied by the floor plan) for each building.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le 100$) and $C$ ($1 \\le C \\le 100$), the size of the location.\n\nEach of the next $R$ lines contains a string of $C$ characters \u2018.\u2019 (dot) or \u2018x\u2019 (lowercase letter). The character \u2018.\u2019 means that nothing was found in that cell, while \u2018x\u2019 indicates that there was a building there.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each of the two buildings, output on a single line the row and column of its upper left corner, and the size (side length) of the building.\n\nNote: the test data will be such that a solution always exists, although it may not be unique. If there is more than one solution, any one will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\nxx.\nxxx\n...\nSample Output 1:\n1 1 2\n2 3 1\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 6\nxx....\nxx.xxx\n...xxx\n...xxx\nSample Output 2:\n1 1 2\n2 4 3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
