How many combinations of numbers of people in the n rooms are possible?\nFind the count modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 2 \\leq k \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nn k\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of possible combinations of numbers of people in the n rooms now, modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n10\n\nLet c_1, c_2, and c_3 be the number of people in Room 1, 2, and 3 now, respectively. There are 10 possible combination of (c_1, c_2, c_3):\n - (0, 0, 3)\n - (0, 1, 2)\n - (0, 2, 1)\n - (0, 3, 0)\n - (1, 0, 2)\n - (1, 1, 1)\n - (1, 2, 0)\n - (2, 0, 1)\n - (2, 1, 0)\n - (3, 0, 0)\nFor example, (c_1, c_2, c_3) will be (0, 1, 2) if the person in Room 1 goes to Room 2 and then one of the persons in Room 2 goes to Room 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
