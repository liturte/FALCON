Gridnavia consists of an $n \\times m$ grid, where at least one language is spoken in each cell. It is known that each of the three languages is spoken in a non-empty connected subset of grid cells. Connected means that it is possible to get between any pair of cells by moving through adjacent cells, where two cells are said to be adjacent if they share a side. \n\nYou have made a survey to find where in Gridnavia each language is spoken. The following question was sent to every cell in the region: \u201cPlease indicate if one or several of the languages is spoken in your cell\u201d. But due to a misprint, there were no choices after the question, so everyone just wrote \u201cone\u201d or \u201cseveral\u201d. So the only thing you know is for each cell whether exactly one, or more than one language is spoken in that cell.\n\nTo make the best out of the situation, you should find any division of the three languages that corresponds to the information.Input\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n,m \\leq 200$).\n\nThe following $n$ lines each contain a string of length $m$, consisting of the characters 1 and 2. The $j$th character on the $i$th line is 1 if exactly one language is spoken in that cell, and 2 if at least two languages are spoken.Output\n\nIf the languages can be divided according to the information, then output three copies of the grid. The first copy should consist of characters \u201cA\u201d and \u201c.\u201d, where the \u201cA\u201d indicates that Arwegian is spoken in that cell, and \u201c.\u201d indicates that it isn\u2019t spoken.

For readability, it is recommended to put empty lines in between the three grids, but it is not necessary to do so.
