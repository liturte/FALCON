The result is two integers A and B. Then it compares A and B, and prints 'GREATER', 'LESS' or 'EQUAL' depending on the comparison.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input is correctly formatted. If the input can have leading zeros or be incorrectly formatted, additional error handling would be needed.\n\nThis solution also assumes that Python is being used as the programming language. If another language is being used, the solution would need to be adapted accordingly.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it reads the input only once and performs a constant amount of work for each comparison. It has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1).\n\nThe solution does not use any libraries or modules and does not import any additional code. It is a pure Python solution.\n\nThe solution does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur when reading the input. If this is a possibility, additional error handling would be needed.\n\nThe solution does not use any special features of Python that may not be available in other", "A, B = [int(input()) for _ in range(2)]\nif A > B:\n    print('GREATER')\nelif A < B:\n    print('LESS')\nelse:\n    print('EQUAL')\n\n\nThis solution reads two integers from the standard input, and then compares them. It then prints 'GREATER' if A is greater than B, 'LESS' if A is less than B, and 'EQUAL' if they are equal.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is valid as per the constraints. If the input is not valid, the program may not work correctly.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input and output.\n\nThis solution is written in Python, but it could be written in any language that supports integer input and comparison operations.\n\n\nThis solution reads two integers from the standard input, and then compares them.
