{"4881": {"code": ["def guess_sum_parity(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return 'Even'\n    else:\n        return 'Odd'\n\n\nThis Python function takes an integer as input and returns a string based on the parity of the sum of the first `n` consecutive positive integers. If `n` is even, the function returns 'Even'. If `n` is odd, the function returns 'Odd'.\n\nThis function works because the sum of the first `n` consecutive positive integers can be expressed as `n/2 * (1 + n)`. If `n` is even, the sum is always even, because the first term is even (2 if `n=2`, 4 if `n=4`, etc.). If `n` is odd, the sum is always odd, because the first term is odd (1 if `n=1`, 3 if `n=3`, etc.).\n\nSo, the parity of the sum of the first `n` consecutive positive integers is determined by the parity of `n`.\n\nThe function doesn't explicitly check if `n` is between 1 and 10, because this is guaranteed by the problem statement. The function could be used with any integer between 1 and 10, but it would not work correctly for other values.", "N = int(input())\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"Even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Odd\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is evenly divisible by 2 (which would mean it is even). If it is, it prints 'Even'. If not, it prints 'Odd'.\n\nFor the case where the sum could be either even or odd, the program would need to know the specific numbers chosen by the user's friend. Given that the numbers are between 1 and 100, the sum could be any number between 1 and 100, so it could be either even or odd. Therefore, the output would be 'Either'.\n\nHere's the code for that:\n\n\nprint(\"Either\")\n\n\nThis code simply prints 'Either' as the output.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.", "N = int(input())\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"Even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Odd\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is straightforward. If the number of integers is even, the sum will be even. If the number of integers is odd, the sum will be odd. Therefore, if the number of integers is even, the output is 'Even'. Otherwise, the output is 'Odd'.\n\nThis solution uses the modulus operator (%) to check if the number of integers is even. If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, then the number is even. Otherwise, the number is odd.\n\nThis solution does not consider the range of the integers. It assumes that the integers are between 1 and 100, which is not mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement is ambiguous regarding the range of the integers, so this solution assumes that the integers are between 1 and 100. If the integers can be in a different range, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso note that the solution does not consider the possibility of the sum being even or odd. The problem statement does not specify whether the sum could be even or odd, so the solution assumes that the sum could be either.", "N = int(input())\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"Even\")\nelif N % 2 != 0:\n    print(\"Odd\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Either\")\n\n\nThis code works by taking the input number `N` and checking if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder (i.e., it is even). If it is, it prints 'Even'. If it is not divisible by 2, then it is odd, so it prints 'Odd'. If `N` is 0, it prints 'Either' because 0 is neither even nor odd.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be a valid integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive).\n\nIt's important to note that the modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of the division. So `N % 2` will be 0 if `N` is even and 1 if `N` is odd.\n\nThis code is a direct translation of the problem statement into Python code.\n\nIf you have any questions about the code or how it works, feel free to ask.", "def main(N):\n    if N % 2 == 0:\n        return 'Even'\n    else:\n        return 'Odd'\n\nprint(main(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program takes an input integer N and checks if it is even or odd. If N is even, it returns 'Even'. If N is odd, it returns 'Odd'. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThe check for even or odd is done by the modulus operator. If a number modulo 2 equals 0, it is even. If it equals anything else, it is odd.\n\nIn this problem, the sum could be even or odd if the number of integers is even or odd, respectively. Thus, the program always returns 'Either'.\n\nThis solution is correct because the problem statement clearly states that the sum could be either even or odd, so there is no need to check if the sum of the numbers is even or odd.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it runs in constant time regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), because the solution uses a constant amount of space."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYour friend has secretly picked $N$ consecutive positive integers between $1$ and $100$, and wants you to guess if their sum is even or odd.\n\nIf the sum must be even, output \u2018Even\u2019.
