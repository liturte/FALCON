The i-th edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and b_i.\nAdditionally, each vertex is painted in a color, and the color of Vertex i is c_i. Here, the color of each vertex is represented by an integer between 1 and N (inclusive). The same integer corresponds to the same color; different integers correspond to different colors.\nFor each k=1, 2, ..., N, solve the following problem:\n - Find the number of simple paths that visit a vertex painted in the color k one or more times.\nNote: The simple paths from Vertex u to v and from v to u are not distinguished.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq c_i \\leq N\n - 1 \\leq a_i,b_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is a tree.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nc_1 c_2 ... c_N\na_1 b_1\n:\na_{N-1} b_{N-1}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answers for k = 1, 2, ..., N in order, each in its own line.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 2 1\n1 2\n2 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n4\n0\n\nLet P_{i,j} denote the simple path connecting Vertex i and j.\nThere are 5 simple paths that visit a vertex painted in the color 1 one or more times:\nP_{1,1}\\,,\\,P_{1,2}\\,,\\,P_{1,3}\\,,\\,P_{2,3}\\,,\\,P_{3,3} \nThere are 4 simple paths that visit a vertex painted in the color 2 one or more times:\nP_{1,2}\\,,\\,P_{1,3}\\,,\\,P_{2,2}\\,,\\,P_{2,3} \nThere are no simple paths that visit a vertex painted in the color 3 one or more times.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
