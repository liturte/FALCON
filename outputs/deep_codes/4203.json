It then checks the following conditions:\n - The first character of S is 'A'. If not, it prints 'WA'.\n - The substring from the third character to the second to last character of S contains exactly one 'C'. If not, it prints 'WA'.\n - All remaining characters of S are lowercase. If not, it prints 'WA'.\n - If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'AC'.\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in string methods islower(), count() and slicing to check the conditions.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string S is always at least 4 characters long. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be necessary.\n\nAlso, this solution does", "S = input()\nif S[0] == 'A' and S.count('C') == 1 and S[3:len(S)-1].islower() and S[1:3].isupper() and S[len(S)-1].islower():\n    print('AC')\nelse:\n    print('WA')\n\n\nThis code reads the string S from the input, and checks each condition using Python's built-in string methods and functions. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'AC'; otherwise, it prints 'WA'.\n\nThe conditions are as follows:\n - S[0] == 'A': The initial character of S is an uppercase A.\n - S.count('C') == 1: There is exactly one occurrence of C between the third character from the beginning and the second to last character (inclusive).\n - S[3:len(S)-1].islower(): All letters except the A and C mentioned above are lowercase.\n - S[1:3].isupper(): The second and third characters are uppercase.\n - S[len(S)-1].islower(): The last character is lower", "S = input()\nif S[0] == \"A\" and S.count(\"C\") == 1 and S[2:-1].islower():\n    print(\"AC\")\nelse:\n\n    print(\"WA\")\n\n\nThis solution uses python's built-in string methods to solve the problem. The `S[0]` checks if the first character is an uppercase A. The `S.count(\"C\")` checks if there is exactly one occurrence of the letter C. The `S[2:-1].islower()` checks if all the letters in the string (excluding the first and last characters) are lowercase. If all these conditions are met, it prints \"AC\", otherwise it prints \"WA\".\n\nPlease note that the problem statement mentions that the length of the string S is between 4 and 10. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the constraints. So, we didn't include this check in the solution.\n\nAlso, the problem statement mentions that each character of S is uppercase or lowercase English letter. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the constraints. So, we didn't include this check in the", "S = input()\nif S[0] == 'A' and S.count('C') == 1 and S[3:len(S)-1].islower() and S[1:3].isupper() and S[len(S)-1].islower():\n    print('AC')\nelse:\n    print('WA')\n\n\nThis code works by first checking if the first character is an uppercase A. It then checks if there is exactly one occurrence of the letter C between the third and second to last character. It then checks if all the letters between these two positions are lowercase. Finally, it checks if the last letter is lowercase. If all these conditions are satisfied, it prints AC. Otherwise, it prints WA.\n\nThe count function is used to count the number of occurrences of the letter C. The islower function is used to check if all the letters are lowercase, and the isupper function is used to check if the third and fourth letters are uppercase.\n\nThe code also assumes that the string S is at least 4 characters long, as per the problem statement.\n\nIt's also important to note that the problem statement", "S = input()\n\nif S[0] != 'A':\n    print('WA')\nelif S[2:len(S)-1].count('C') != 1:\n    print('WA')\nelif not S[1:len(S)].islower():\n    print('WA')\nelse:\n print('AC')\n\nThis code reads the string, checks the conditions and prints 'AC' if all conditions are satisfied and 'WA' if any condition is not satisfied.\nIt first checks if the first character is 'A'. If not, it prints 'WA'. Then it checks if exactly one 'C' is between the third and second to last characters. If not, it prints 'WA'. Finally, it checks if all remaining characters are lowercase. If not, it prints 'WA'. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'AC'.\n\nThe use of the count() method in Python counts the number of occurrences of 'C' in the string between the third and second to last characters.\nThe islower() method in Python checks if all the characters in the string are lowercase.\n\"\"\"\n\nS = input()"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S.
