The website is a very simple one. People will visit the site occasionally to see if it is Halloween. Whenever it is, the website should print out yup, otherwise it should print out nope on the screen.\n\nSince HiQ is such a popular firm, they don\u2019t have time to complete this assignment right now. Their frontend engineers have already programmed the frontend of the website that prints out yup or nope, but not the backend microservice that determines whether it is indeed Halloween or not. Do you have time to help them?\n\nThe behaviour of the server should be as follows: it gets as input the current date in the format FEB 9, where FEB is the month given in three letters (JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC) and 9 is the day of the month starting at 1. It should then determine if this date represents October 31 or December 25 (since $31_8 = 25_{10}$).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing a date of the format FEB 9, with the month and date separated by a single space.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the date is October 31 or December 25, output yup. Otherwise, output nope.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nOCT 31\nSample Output:\nyup\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
