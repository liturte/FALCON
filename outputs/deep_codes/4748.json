How many more bricks are needed if Kim already has $N$ bricks of size $2 \\times 2$ and $M$ bricks of size $4 \\times 2$? A pyramid is hollow and consists of $H$ layers, as shown in the image. The $k$th layer has width $2k$ for $1\\leq k\\leq H$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThree integers $1 \\leq H \\leq 1000$, $0 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$, and $0 \\leq M \\leq 10^6$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint two integers $A$ and $B$ on a single line, where $A$ is the number of extra $2 \\times 2$-bricks needed and $B$ is the number of extra $4 \\times 2$-bricks. You must use as few extra bricks as possible, so you must minimise $A+B$. If there is more than one such solution, print the one maximising $A$.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample 2-----\nSample input $2$ corresponds to the situation shown in the image. Starting with the bricks in the unfinished pyramid to the right, Kim can build the left pyramid using an extra $2 \\times 2$-brick and $4$ extra $4 \\times 2$-bricks. There is no way to finish a height-$4$ pyramid with fewer than $5$ extra bricks. Note that it is also possible to build a height-$4$ pyramid using $5$ extra bricks of size $4\\times 2$ (and no extra $2\\times 2$-bricks). However, the sample output is correct because it uses more extra $2 \\times 2$-bricks.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 1 0\nSample Output 1:\n0 0\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 2 7\nSample Output 2:\n1 4\n\nSample Input 3:\n3 0 0\nSample Output 3:\n1 6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
