They can meet up with their buddies in the ITU Friday bar and discuss anything they want: the weather, sports, favourite editors, politics, religion, and gossip about celebrities. Life can be good.\n\nUnfortunately, they don\u2019t know which day of the week it is! They\u2019ve woken up in a strange apartment, phones missing, and with little memory of the recent past. Which day is it? Which year is it even?\n\nAfter some searching, they establish today\u2019s date, because the calendar on the wall displays it. Also, \u00c5se has found the remains of an old newspaper from 1 January in her handbag, which has that weekday printed on the front page.\n\nHelp B\u00f8rge and \u00c5se figure out if today is Friday.\n\n-----Input-----\nOn the first line, today\u2019s date. The date consists of two parts, separated by space. The first part is in an integer (the day of the month) $d$, with $1\\leq d\\leq 31$. The second part is the name of the month, abbreviated as JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, or DEC.\n\nOn the second line, the name of the day on 1 January of the current year, abbreviated as MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line: The four letters TGIF, abbreviating \u201cThank God it\u2019s Friday\u201d if today is certainly Friday. The two words not sure if today might be Friday, depending on if this year has a 29th of February. The emoticon :( if today is certainly not Friday.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n10 OCT\nMON\nSample Output 1:\n:(\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 JAN\nTHU\nSample Output 2:\nTGIF\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
