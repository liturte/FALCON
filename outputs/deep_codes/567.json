Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend \u2014 at position 10^6 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.\n\nYou know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.\n\nNow you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of prizes.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (2 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6 - 1) \u2014 the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 9\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n2\n2 999995\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.\n\nIn the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
