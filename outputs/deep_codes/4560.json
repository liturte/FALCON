Then it checks if N is a multiple of 500 (which means it can be paid exactly using only 500-yen coins) or if the remainder of N divided by 500 is less than or equal to A (which means it can be paid with A 1-yen coins and some 500-yen coins).

If he only has A 1-yen coins, the condition in the if statement should be changed to N >= 500 * A + A.\n\nThis code will run in O(1) time, meaning it will always execute in the same amount of time regardless of the input size.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\nN, A = map(int, input().split", "N, A = map(int, input().split())\nif N % 500 == 0:\n    print('Yes' if N // 500 <= A else 'No')\nelse:\n    print('Yes' if (N // 500 + 1) * 500 - N <= A else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by first checking if N is a multiple of 500. If it is, it simply checks if E869120 has enough 500-yen coins. If N is not a multiple of 500, it calculates the next multiple of 500 and checks if E869120 has enough 500-yen coins to pay the difference between N and the next multiple of 500. If he has, he can pay N yen.\n\nFor example, if N is 2018, the next multiple of 500 is 2500. The difference between 2018 and 2500 is 482. Since E869120 has 218 500-yen", "N, A = map(int, input().split())\nif N % 500 == 0:\n    print('Yes' if N // 500 <= A else 'No')\nelse:\n    print('Yes' if (N // 500 + 1) * 500 - A <= N % 500 else 'No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program solves the problem by first checking if N is divisible by 500 (i.e., if it is a multiple of 500-yen coins). If it is, we simply need to make sure that there are enough 500-yen coins (N // 500, rounded down) to pay for N yen. If there are not enough, we print 'No'.\n\nIf N is not divisible by 500, we need to use a 1-yen coin to pay the remaining amount (N % 500). We need to find the smallest number of 1-yen coins that can cover this amount. This is done by rounding up the number of 500-yen coins used in the previous"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nE869120 has A 1-yen coins and infinitely many 500-yen coins.\n\nDetermine if he can pay exactly N yen using only these coins.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer between 1 and 10000 (inclusive).\n - A is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA\n\n-----Output-----\nIf E869120 can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2018\n218\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nWe can pay 2018 yen with four 500-yen coins and 18 1-yen coins, so the answer is Yes.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
