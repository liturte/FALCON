They were the notes of the venerable Professor E. I. N. Stein who earlier in the day solved the elusive maximum quadrilateral problem! Quick, you have to redo his work so no one noticed what happened. \n\nThe maximum quadrilateral problem is quite easy to state: given four side lengths $s_1, s_2, s_3$ and $s_4$, find the maximum area of any quadrilateral that can be constructed using these lengths. A quadrilateral is a polygon with four vertices.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line with four positive integers, the four side lengths $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$, and $s_4$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $2s_ i < \\sum _{j=1}^4 s_ j$, for all $i$, and that $1 \\leq s_ i \\leq 1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single real number, the maximal area as described above. Your answer must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 3 3\nSample Output 1:\n9\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 2 1 1\nSample Output 2:\n1.299038105676658\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
