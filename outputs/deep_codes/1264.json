Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n) and flips all values a_{k} for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is i \u2264 k \u2264 j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x.\n\nThe goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). In the second line of the input there are n integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint an integer \u2014 the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 0 0 1 0\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 (i = 2, j = 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].\n\nIn the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (i = 2, j = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
