{"1119": {"code": ["MOD", "MOD", "def", "from", "def"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given three integers k, p_{a} and p_{b}.\n\nYou will construct a sequence with the following algorithm: Initially, start with the empty sequence. Each second, you do the following. With probability p_{a} / (p_{a} + p_{b}), add 'a' to the end of the sequence. Otherwise (with probability p_{b} / (p_{a} + p_{b})), add 'b' to the end of the sequence.\n\nYou stop once there are at least k subsequences that form 'ab'. Determine the expected number of times 'ab' is a subsequence in the resulting sequence. It can be shown that this can be represented by P / Q, where P and Q are coprime integers, and $Q \\neq 0 \\operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7)$. Print the value of $P \\cdot Q^{-1} \\operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7)$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line will contain three integers integer k, p_{a}, p_{b} (1 \u2264 k \u2264 1 000, 1 \u2264 p_{a}, p_{b} \u2264 1 000 000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 1 4\n\nOutput\n370000006\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first sample, we will keep appending to our sequence until we get the subsequence 'ab' at least once. For instance, we get the sequence 'ab' with probability 1/4, 'bbab' with probability 1/16, and 'aab' with probability 1/8. Note, it's impossible for us to end with a sequence like 'aabab', since we would have stopped our algorithm once we had the prefix 'aab'. \n\nThe expected amount of times that 'ab' will occur across all valid sequences is 2. \n\nFor the second sample, the answer is equal to $\\frac{341}{100}$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
