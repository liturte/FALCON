It should work on any system that supports Python 3.x.\n\nPlease note that this program does not include any error checking or handling of invalid input.

The `map` function is used to convert the input string to two floating-point numbers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input string into two parts at each space. The `float` function is used to convert these strings to floating-point numbers.\n\nThe `print` function is then used to print the result of `int(A * B)`, which is the product of A and B truncated to an integer. The `int` function is used to truncate the floating-point result to an integer.\n\nThis code assumes that A is an integer and B is a number with two digits after the decimal point. It also assumes that A is less than or equal to 10^15 and B is less than 10. If these conditions are not met, the code may not work correctly.", "A, B = map(float, input().split())\nprint(int(A * B))\n\n\nThis code reads two numbers A and B from the input, multiplies them, truncates the fractional part, and prints the result as an integer. The input is split into two separate variables using the split() function, which splits the input into a list of substrings based on spaces. The map() function then applies the float() function to each of these substrings, converting them into floats. The results are stored in A and B. The multiplication of A and B is then truncated by the int() function, which removes the fractional part and returns the integer part. Finally, the result is printed to the standard output.\n\nPlease note that the decimal part of B should be between 0 and 99. If B is greater than 99, you should adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the input will be in the correct format and does not handle errors for invalid inputs. You may want to add error handling code to make the code more robust.\n\nThis code uses the Python programming language.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\n\nA, B = map(float, input().split())\nprint(int(A * B))\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"\"\"\nThe provided code works by splitting the input string into two parts using the split() function.
