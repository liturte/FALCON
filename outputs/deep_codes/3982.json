All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $S$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") \n\nAlthough unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
