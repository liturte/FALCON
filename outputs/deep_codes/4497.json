It keeps track of the integer with the maximum count and prints this integer.

This is equivalent to counting how many times the number can be divided by 2 without remainder. The number of '1's is subtracted by 1 to exclude the leading '1' in the binary representation. If the count of '1's for the current number is greater than the current maximum count, the count and the number are updated.
