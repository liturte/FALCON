He is typing on an unusual keyboard with characters arranged in following way:\n\nqwertyuiop\n\nasdfghjkl;\n\nzxcvbnm,./\n\n\n\nUnfortunately Mole is blind, so sometimes it is problem for him to put his hands accurately. He accidentally moved both his hands with one position to the left or to the right. That means that now he presses not a button he wants, but one neighboring button (left or right, as specified in input).\n\nWe have a sequence of characters he has typed and we want to find the original message.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of the input contains one letter describing direction of shifting ('L' or 'R' respectively for left or right).\n\nSecond line contains a sequence of characters written by Mole. The size of this sequence will be no more than 100. Sequence contains only symbols that appear on Mole's keyboard. It doesn't contain spaces as there is no space on Mole's keyboard.\n\nIt is guaranteed that even though Mole hands are moved, he is still pressing buttons on keyboard and not hitting outside it.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a line that contains the original message.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nR\ns;;upimrrfod;pbr\n\nOutput\nallyouneedislove\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
