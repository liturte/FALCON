Your task is to construct a binary string $s$ of length $n = a + b$ such that there are exactly $a$ zeroes, exactly $b$ ones and exactly $x$ indices $i$ (where $1 \\le i < n$) such that $s_i \\ne s_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\n\nFor example, for the string \"01010\" there are four indices $i$ such that $1 \\le i < n$ and $s_i \\ne s_{i + 1}$ ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$). For the string \"111001\" there are two such indices $i$ ($i = 3, 5$).\n\nRecall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le 100, 1 \\le x < a + b)$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint only one string $s$, where $s$ is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 1\n\nOutput\n1100\n\nInput\n3 3 3\n\nOutput\n101100\n\nInput\n5 3 6\n\nOutput\n01010100\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nAll possible answers for the first example:   1100;  0011. \n\nAll possible answers for the second example:   110100;  101100;  110010;  100110;  011001;  001101;  010011;  001011.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
