It creates a number with n bits set to 1 using the left shift operator (`<<`), which is equivalent to $2^n$. This number is then subtracted by 1, giving a number with n least significant bits set to 1. When this number is bitwise ANDed with m, it results in m with n least significant bits set to 0. This is the same as m mod $2^n$.\n\nFor example, if n = 4 and m =", "n = int(input())\nm = int(input())\nprint(m & ((1 << n) - 1))\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe operation `m & ((1 << n) - 1)` is equivalent to `m mod 2^n`.\n\nThe `<<` operator is a bitwise left shift operator, which moves the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of places.\n\nThe `1 << n` operation shifts 1 to the left by n places, resulting in a number with n zeros at the end.\n\nThe `- 1` operation then flips all the zeros to ones, resulting in", "n = int(input())\nm = int(input())\nprint(m & ((1 << n) - 1))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn this problem, we're given two numbers, n and m. We need to calculate m modulo 2^n.\n\nThe modulo operation finds the remainder of division of one number by another. For example, the remainder of 42 divided by 16 is 10.\n\nIn this problem, we need to calculate the modulo of m by 2^n. The modulo operation can be calculated using the bitwise AND operator (&).\n\nThe bitwise AND operation compares each bit", "n = int(input())\nm = int(input())\nprint(m & ((1 << n) - 1))", "n = int(input())\nm = int(input())\nprint(m & ((1 << n) - 1))\n\n\nThis solution uses bitwise operators to solve the problem. The expression `(1 << n) - 1` calculates 2^n - 1, and the bitwise AND operator (`&`) is used to calculate `m mod 2^n`.\n\nThe bitwise AND operator `&` works as follows: for each pair of corresponding bits in the binary representation of `m` and `2^n - 1` (or `(1 << n) - 1`), if both bits are 1, the corresponding bit"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe following problem is well-known: given integers n and m, calculate $2^{n} \\operatorname{mod} m$, \n\nwhere 2^{n} = 2\u00b72\u00b7...\u00b72 (n factors), and $x \\operatorname{mod} y$ denotes the remainder of division of x by y.\n\nYou are asked to solve the \"reverse\" problem.
