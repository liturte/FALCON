{"4006": {"code": ["def", "def", "def", "n", "def"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLet's denote a function $f(x)$ in such a way: we add $1$ to $x$, then, while there is at least one trailing zero in the resulting number, we remove that zero. For example,   $f(599) = 6$: $599 + 1 = 600 \\rightarrow 60 \\rightarrow 6$;  $f(7) = 8$: $7 + 1 = 8$;  $f(9) = 1$: $9 + 1 = 10 \\rightarrow 1$;  $f(10099) = 101$: $10099 + 1 = 10100 \\rightarrow 1010 \\rightarrow 101$. \n\nWe say that some number $y$ is reachable from $x$ if we can apply function $f$ to $x$ some (possibly zero) times so that we get $y$ as a result. For example, $102$ is reachable from $10098$ because $f(f(f(10098))) = f(f(10099)) = f(101) = 102$; and any number is reachable from itself.\n\nYou are given a number $n$; your task is to count how many different numbers are reachable from $n$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer: the number of different numbers that are reachable from $n$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1098\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n10\n\nOutput\n19\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe numbers that are reachable from $1098$ are:\n\n$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1098, 1099$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
