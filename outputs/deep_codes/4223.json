We iterate through the string S, and for each slime, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same color as the current slime.

For each slime in the string, if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the same color as the current slime, the current slime is pushed onto the stack. If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same color as the current slime, the top of the stack is popped from the stack. In the end, the length of the stack is the number of slimes left.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the string S. This is because each character in S is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also O(N) in the worst case when all characters are different, as the stack will store all characters.\n\n\n'''\n\n# Solution", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\n\nstack = []\nfor s in S:\n    if stack and stack[-1] == s:\n        continue\n    else:\n        stack.append(s)\nprint(len(stack))\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis solution uses a stack to keep track of the slimes.
