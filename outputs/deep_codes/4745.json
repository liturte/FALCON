To remedy this, you decide to run a special offer: you will mark some subset of the $n$ items for sale in your store as participating in the offer, and if people buy exactly two of these items, and the cost of these items is strictly more than $X$ euros, you will give them a free complimentary unicorn horn!\n\nSince you recently found out all your unicorn horns are really narwhal tusks, you decide to rig the offer by picking the participating items in such a way that no one can earn a horn anyway.\n\nTo make sure no one becomes suspicious, you want to mark as many items as possible as participating in the offer.\n\n-----Input-----\n - On the first line are two integers, $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, the number of items for sale in your store, and $1\\leq X \\leq 10^9$, the minimum cost specified in the statement.\n - On the second line are $n$ positive integers, each at most $10^9$. These are the prices of the items in the store.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum number of items you can mark as part of your special offer, without anyone actually being able to receive a horn.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 6\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 10\n4 8 1 9 7\nSample Output 2:\n2\n\nSample Input 3:\n4 10\n1 3 1 7\nSample Output 3:\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
