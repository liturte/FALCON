That is, given six unit squares that are attached together along some of their sides, can we form a unit cube by folding this arrangement?\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of $6$ lines each containing $6$ characters, describing the initial arrangement of unit squares. Each character is either a ., meaning it is empty, or a # meaning it is a unit square.\n\nThere are precisely $6$ occurrences of # indicating the unit squares. These form a connected component, meaning it is possible to reach any # from any other # without touching a . by making only horizontal and vertical movements. Furthermore, there is no $2 \\times 2$ subsquare consisting of only #. That is, the pattern\n\n##\n##\n\ndoes not appear in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf you can fold the unit squares into a cube, display can fold. Otherwise display cannot fold.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n......\n......\n######\n......\n......\n......\nSample Output 1:\ncannot fold\n\nSample Input 2:\n......\n#.....\n####..\n#.....\n......\n......\nSample Output 2:\ncan fold\n\nSample Input 3:\n..##..\n...#..\n..##..\n...#..\n......\n......\nSample Output 3:\ncannot fold\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
