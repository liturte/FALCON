He has recently acquired access to an advanced high-precision plotter and he is planning to print the greeting card on the plotter.\n\nHere\u2019s how the plotter operates. In step one, the plotter plots an intricate pattern of $n$ dots on the paper. In step two, the picture in the greeting emerges when the plotter connects by a straight segment each pair of dots that are exactly $2018$ length units apart.\n\nThe plotter uses a special holographic ink, which has a limited supply. Quido wants to know the number of all plotted segments in the picture to be sure that there is enough ink to complete the job.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $n$ specifying the number of plotted points. The following $n$ lines each contain a pair of space-separated integer coordinates indicating one plotted point. Each coordinate is non-negative and less than $2^{31}$. There are at most $10^{5}$ points, all of them are distinct.\n\nIn this problem, all coordinates and distances are expressed in plotter length units, the length of the unit in the x-direction and in the y-direction is the same.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains a single integer equal to the number of pairs of points which are exactly $2018$ length units apart.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n20180000 20180000\n20180000 20182018\n20182018 20180000\n20182018 20182018\nSample Output:\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
