We can cut half the apples into pieces and use them to make apple pies, but if we have more apple pieces than apples, we can't cut any more apples. Therefore, we use the minimum of the two to determine the number of apple pies we can make.\n\nThis solution assumes that the number of apple pies we can make is the same as the number of apple pieces we can use. If there is a possibility of using the apple pieces to make more apple pies, then the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the number of apple pies we can make is the same as the number of apples we can use. If there is a possibility of using the apples to make more apple pies, then the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the number of apple pies we can make is the same as the number of apple pieces we can use.

Then, we calculate the number of apple pies we can make by dividing the total number of pieces by 2 (since we can make one apple pie with two pieces). The \"//\" operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part of the division.\n\nThis solution assumes that we can only make apple pies by simmering two pieces of apple. If we can also cut an apple into smaller pieces and make a pie with one piece, we would need to add a step to count the number of pieces we have, and adjust the calculation of the number of pies accordingly.", "A, P = map(int, input().split())\npieces = A * 3 + P\nprint(pieces // 2)\n\n\nThis code first reads the number of apples and pieces of apple from the input. It then calculates the total number of pieces of apple by multiplying the number of apples by 3 and adding the number of pieces of apple. Finally, it prints the integer division of the total number of pieces by 2, which is the maximum number of apple pies we can make.\n\nThis solution assumes that we can always make a pie by simmering exactly 2 pieces of apple. If we can make a pie with 3 pieces of apple, we would replace `2` with `3` in the line where we calculate the number of pies.\n\nThis solution also assumes that we can always cut an apple into 3 pieces. If we can cut an apple into any number of pieces, we would replace `3` with a variable that stores the number of pieces we can cut.", "A, P = map(int, input().split())\npieces = A * 3 + P\npies = pieces // 2\nprint(pies)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads the number of apples and pieces of apple from the input. It calculates the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of apples by 3 and adding the number of pieces. It then calculates the maximum number of apple pies by dividing the total number of pieces by 2 (since we can make one apple pie with two pieces). Finally, it prints the result.\n\nPlease note that the \"//\" operator is used for integer division in Python, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part of the division result. This is used to ensure that we get a whole number of pies, as you can't have a fraction of a pie.\n\nThis solution assumes that we can't make a pie with less than two pieces, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nSample input:\n1 3\n\nSample output:\n3\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nSample input:\n2 2\n\nSample output:\n4\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nSample input:\n10 0\n\nSample output:\n33\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"", "A, P = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the number of apples we can get from the given pieces\napples = P // 3\n\n# If we have enough apples, make as many pies as we can\nif A >= apples:\n    print(apples)\n# If we don't have enough apples, make as many pies as we have apples\nelse:\n    print(A)\n\n\nThis solution works by first calculating how many apples we can get from the given pieces of apple. It then checks if we have enough apples to make as many pies as we have. If we do, it prints the number of pies we can make. If we don't, it prints the number of pies we can make with the apples we do have.\n\nThis solution assumes that we can only make apple pies from full apples. If we can make pies from a cut apple, we would need to adjust the solution accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the number of apples we can get from the pieces of apple is always a multiple of 3. If this is not the case, we would need to adjust the solution accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the number of apples and pieces of apple given will always be in the range 0 to 100.
