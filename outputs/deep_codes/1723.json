The problem statement is:\n\nGiven an undirected tree consisting of n nodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge (u, v) that belongs to the tree, either u is in the set, or v is in the set, or both are in the set. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:  Root the tree at node 1.  Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it be evenCnt.  Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it be oddCnt.  The answer is the minimum between evenCnt and oddCnt. \n\nThe depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.\n\nEhab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of n nodes.
