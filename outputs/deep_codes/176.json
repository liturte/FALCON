{"176": {"code": ["k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b // k) - ((a - 1) // k))\n\n\nThis program works by calculating the integer division of `b` and `a - 1` by `k`. The result is the number of multiples of `k` in the range `[a, b]`.\n\nThe integer division operator `//` is used to perform integer division, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part.\n\nSo, `(b // k)` gives the number of multiples of `k` that are less than or equal to `b`, and `((a - 1) // k)` gives the number of multiples of `k` that are less than `a`.\n\nThe difference between these two values gives the number of multiples of `k` that are in the range `[a, b]`.\n\nThis solution assumes that the inputs will be valid. If the inputs could be invalid, the program should include error checking code to handle these cases.", "k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b // k) - ((a - 1) // k))\n\n\nThis solution works by using integer division (//) to find the number of multiples of k in the range [a, b]. The number of multiples of k in the range [a, b] is calculated as b // k minus the number of multiples of k in the range [1, a-1]. The range [1, a-1] is calculated by subtracting ((a - 1) // k) from b // k.\n\nThe code then prints the result of this calculation.\n\nThis solution assumes that a and b are always integers and that k is a positive integer. If these assumptions are not true, the code may not work as expected.\n\nThe code also assumes that the range [a, b] includes both end points. If this is not the case, the code will not work correctly.\n\nPlease note that this code does not check for the validity of the inputs. If the inputs are not valid, the code will not produce the correct result.", "k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b // k) - ((a - 1) // k))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the mathematical property that any integer can be represented as (x // k) * k + r, where x is the integer part of x, k is the divisor, and r is the remainder.\n\nThe number of k-divisible numbers on the segment [a, b] is equal to the number of integer parts of x in [a, b] (i.e., (b // k) - ((a - 1) // k)). The \"-1\" in ((a - 1) // k) is because we need to exclude the numbers that are less than a.\n\nThe \"//\" operator is used for integer division in Python.\n\nThe \"map\" function is used to convert the input strings to integers.\n\nThe \"split\" function is used to split the input string by spaces.\n\nThe \"print\" function is used to output the result.\n\nThe code doesn't handle the case when a > b or k = 0, because these cases are not covered by the problem statement.", "k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b // k) - ((a - 1) // k))\n\n\nThis code works by dividing the upper and lower bounds of the segment by k and taking the difference. It uses integer division (//) to get the largest integer less than or equal to the quotient. This is the number of k-divisible numbers in the segment.\n\nFor example, for k=2, a=-4, b=4, the code calculates:\n\n- (4 // 2) - ((-5) // 2) = 2 - (-2) = 4\n\nSo there are 4 k-divisible numbers in the segment [-4, 4].\n\nNote: The input values are assumed to be valid and do not need to be checked for validity.\n\nAlso, the code assumes that the bounds of the segment are inclusive. If they were exclusive, the code would need to adjust the calculation by subtracting 1 from the lower bound.\n\nThis code is written in Python 3.\n\nPlease note that the condition \"1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^18\" means that the k value can be very large. In Python, the range of integers that can be represented is limited by the available memory, so it's not feasible to generate all possible k values within this range. Therefore, this code might not work for very", "k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b // k) - ((a - 1) // k))\n\n\nThis solution is based on the mathematical fact that the number of k-divisible integers in the range [a, b] is equal to the number of k-divisible integers in the range [0, b] minus the number of k-divisible integers in the range [0, a-1]. The \"//\" operator is used for integer division in Python.\n\nFor example, if k=2, a=-4, b=4, the range [0, b] has 5 k-divisible integers (0, 2, 4), and the range [0, a-1] has 2 k-divisible integers (-2, 0), so the number of k-divisible integers in the range [a, b] is 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nThis solution works for all possible k, a, and b values, including negative ones and large values.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the inputs will be valid and will not check for input errors.\n\nIt's also important to note that this solution may not work correctly for very large values of k due to the limitations of Python's integer division and the range of the int type.\n\nIf you need to handle very large values of k, you may need to use a different approach that can handle"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFind the number of k-divisible numbers on the segment [a, b].
