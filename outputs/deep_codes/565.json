They have $y$ yellow ornaments, $b$ blue ornaments and $r$ red ornaments.\n\nIn Bob's opinion, a Christmas Tree will be beautiful if:  the number of blue ornaments used is greater by exactly $1$ than the number of yellow ornaments, and  the number of red ornaments used is greater by exactly $1$ than the number of blue ornaments. \n\nThat is, if they have $8$ yellow ornaments, $13$ blue ornaments and $9$ red ornaments, we can choose $4$ yellow, $5$ blue and $6$ red ornaments ($5=4+1$ and $6=5+1$).\n\nAlice wants to choose as many ornaments as possible, but she also wants the Christmas Tree to be beautiful according to Bob's opinion.\n\nIn the example two paragraphs above, we would choose $7$ yellow, $8$ blue and $9$ red ornaments. If we do it, we will use $7+8+9=24$ ornaments. That is the maximum number.\n\nSince Alice and Bob are busy with preparing food to the New Year's Eve, they are asking you to find out the maximum number of ornaments that can be used in their beautiful Christmas Tree! \n\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to choose at least $6$ ($1+2+3=6$) ornaments.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three integers $y$, $b$, $r$ ($1 \\leq y \\leq 100$, $2 \\leq b \\leq 100$, $3 \\leq r \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of yellow, blue and red ornaments. \n\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to choose at least $6$ ($1+2+3=6$) ornaments.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of ornaments that can be used. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 13 9\n\nOutput\n24\nInput\n13 3 6\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the answer is $7+8+9=24$.\n\nIn the second example, the answer is $2+3+4=9$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
