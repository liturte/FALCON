There are exactly $n$ toys in the shop for sale, the cost of the $i$-th toy is $i$ burles. She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is $k$ burles. How many ways to do that does she have?\n\nEach toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are considered equal. Pairs $(a, b)$, where $a=b$, are not allowed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{14}$) \u2014 the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition above. Print 0, if Tanechka can choose no pair of toys in such a way that their total cost is $k$ burles.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 5\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n8 15\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 20\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n1000000000000 1000000000001\n\nOutput\n500000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Tanechka can choose the pair of toys ($1, 4$) or the pair of toys ($2, 3$).\n\nIn the second example Tanechka can choose only the pair of toys ($7, 8$).\n\nIn the third example choosing any pair of toys will lead to the total cost less than $20$. So the answer is 0.\n\nIn the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: $(1, 1000000000000)$, $(2, 999999999999)$, $(3, 999999999998)$, ..., $(500000000000, 500000000001)$. The number of such pairs is exactly $500000000000$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
