Eris, the goddess of discord, finds this terribly boring and plans to add some mischief to the mix to make things more fun. She will sabotage the answers of Zeus so that his list of numbers is no longer sorted, which will no doubt be so embarrassing that he becomes furious and starts a minor war. \n\nEris must be careful not to be discovered while performing her sabotage, so she decides to only change a single digit in one of the numbers in Zeus\u2019 answer. The resulting number may not have any leading zeros (unless it becomes equal to zero in which case a single zero digit is allowed). Eris can only replace a digit with another digit \u2013 adding or removing digits is not allowed.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$), the length of Zeus\u2019 answer. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ n$ ($0 \\leq a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots \\le a_ n \\leq 10^{15}$), Zeus\u2019 answer.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Eris can make the list not be sorted by changing a single digit of one of the numbers, then output $n$ integers $b_1, \\ldots , b_ n$, the resulting list of numbers after making the change. Otherwise, output \u201cimpossible\u201d. If there are many valid solutions, any one will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2020 2020 2020\nSample Output 1:\n2021 2020 2020\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n1 9999999\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
