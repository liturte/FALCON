Parts are distinguishable, but connecting components are not.\nPart i has d_i holes, called Hole 1, Hole 2, ..., Hole d_i, into which a connecting component can be inserted. These holes in the parts are distinguishable.\nEach connecting component will be inserted into two holes in different parts, connecting these two parts. It is impossible to insert multiple connecting components into a hole.\nThe character figure is said to be complete when it has the following properties:\n - All of the N-1 components are used to connect parts.\n - Consider a graph with N vertices corresponding to the parts and N-1 undirected edges corresponding to the pairs of vertices connected by a connecting component. Then, this graph is connected.\nTwo ways A and B to make the figure complete are considered the same when the following is satisfied: for every pair of holes, A uses a connecting component to connect these holes if and only if B uses one to connect them.\nFind the number of ways to make the figure complete. Since the answer can be enormous, find the count modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq d_i < 998244353\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nd_1 d_2 \\cdots d_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 1 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n6\n\nOne way to make the figure complete is to connect Hole 1 in Part 1 and Hole 3 in Part 3 and then connect Hole 1 in Part 2 and Hole 1 in Part 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
