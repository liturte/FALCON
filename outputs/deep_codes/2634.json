It first initializes an empty list result. It then calls a helper function dfs, which is a recursive function that generates all possible subsets of nums. dfs takes three arguments: the remaining part of nums, the current path (a list of integers), and the result list. It adds the current path to the result list. It then iterates over the remaining part of nums, calling dfs recursively with the remaining part of nums, the current path plus the current number, and the result list.\n\nFinally, subsets returns the result list, which contains all possible subsets of nums.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N * 2^N) and a space complexity of O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of nums.\n'''\n\ndef subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    result =", "class Solution:\n    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        res = []\n        self.dfs(nums, [], res)\n        return res\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, path, res):\n        res.append(path)\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums[i + 1:], path + [nums[i]], res)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to find all subsets. The DFS function is called recursively with the remaining numbers (nums[i+1:]) and the current path (path + [nums[i]]). The base case of the DFS is when there are no more numbers left, then the current path is appended to the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that all subsets are generated, including the empty set and those that contain all elements in nums. The time complexity is O(N * 2^N), where N is the number of elements in nums. This is because for each element in nums, we have two options (include it or not) and we do this for N elements. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the result.\n\nNote: The solution assumes that the input list `nums` is sorted. If `nums` is not sorted, it might give incorrect results.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# test\nnums = [1", "class Solution:\n    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, result):\n        result.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to find all possible subsets. The idea is to start from an empty subset (represented by an empty list) and gradually add elements to it. This is done by calling a helper function `dfs`, which is a recursive function that takes the current subset, the starting index, the current subset, and the list of all subsets as arguments.\n\nThe `dfs` function first adds the current subset to the list of all subsets. Then it iterates over the remaining elements in the list, and for each element, it calls itself with the updated subset and the next index. This continues until all elements have been processed.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of all subsets. The order of the subsets in the output matches the order in which the subsets are generated by the `dfs` function.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N * 2^N), where N is the number of elements in the input list,", "class Solution:\n    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, result):\n        result.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nExplanation:\nWe use a depth-first search to find all possible subsets. The basic idea is to add each number in the nums list into the subset one by one. If the subset is not in the result list, add it. The dfs function is called recursively to add the next number into the subset. The process stops when all numbers in nums have been added into the subset.\n\nThe time complexity is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of nums. This is because for each of the 2^N possible subsets, we spend a cost of O(N) to build it. The space complexity is O(N * 2^N) as well, because of the space used by the result list.\n\nThe solution does not include the empty set because it is considered a subset of every set, and it is included by default.", "class Solution:\n    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, result):\n        result.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nThis solution uses Depth-first Search (DFS) to generate all possible subsets. The dfs function is called recursively to generate the subsets. The base case is when the index is equal to the length of nums, it appends the path to the result. The recursive case is when the index is less than the length of nums, it continues to call dfs with the next index and the current path plus the current number.\n\nThis solution is efficient as it generates all possible subsets in O(N * 2^N) time where N is the length of nums. It also uses O(N) space for the recursion stack.\n\nThe solution is correct because it generates all possible subsets of the given set, including the empty set and the set itself. It does not include duplicate subsets because it only adds a path to the result if it has not been added before.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Task 2:\n# Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).\n\nNote: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.\n\nExample:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput:\n[\n  [3],\n\u00a0 [1],\n\u00a0 [2],\n\u00a0 [1,2,3],\n\u00a0 [1,3],\n\u00a0 [2,3],\n\u00a0 [1,2],\n\u00a0 []\n]\nSTARTER CODE:\nclass Solution:\n    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        \n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
