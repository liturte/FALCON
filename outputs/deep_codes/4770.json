Dr. Chaz has severe OCD and is very strict on rules during dinner, specifically, he needs to be sure that everyone take exactly $1$ piece of chicken at his buffet, even if that will result in an enormous amount of leftovers. This is why every year before the dinner, Dr. Chaz would give a powerful speech: \u201cEveryone, one chicken per person!\u201d\n\nHowever, Dr. Chaz does not always have an idea how many pieces of chicken he needs, he believes if there are $N$ people at the buffet and everyone takes exactly $1$ piece of chicken, providing $M$ pieces of chicken will be perfect, i.e., is enough and will have no leftovers. Help Dr. Chaz find out whether his decision is good or not!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contain integers $0\\leq N\\leq 1000$, $0\\leq M\\leq 1000$, $N\\neq M$ , the number of people at the buffet and the number of pieces of chicken Dr. Chaz is providing.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line of the form \u201cDr. Chaz will have $P$ piece[s] of chicken left over!\u201d, if Dr. Chaz has enough chicken and $P$ pieces of chicken will be left over, or \u201cDr. Chaz needs $Q$ more piece[s] of chicken!\u201d if Dr. Chaz does not have enough pieces of chicken and needs $Q$ more.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n20 100\nSample Output 1:\nDr. Chaz will have 80 pieces of chicken left over!\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\nDr. Chaz will have 1 piece of chicken left over!\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
