This allows to compute the sequence A_i modulo M in a very efficient way. The sum of the sequence A is then computed and printed.\n\nNote: The pow function is available from Python 3.5 onwards. If you're using an older version of Python, you'll need to implement the power function by yourself.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N) because it computes the sequence A_i for N times.

The function solve() is used to calculate the sum of the sequence. The pow(A[i - 1], 2) % m is used to calculate the remainder of the square of A[i - 1] divided by m. The sum() function is used to calculate the sum of the sequence. The input() function is used to get the input from the standard input. The map() function is used to convert the input to integers.\n\nThis code is efficient because it uses a loop", "N, X, M = map(int, input().split())\nA = [0] * (N+1)\nA[1] = X\nfor i in range(2, N+1):\n    A[i] = pow(A[i-1], 2) % M\nprint(sum(A) % M)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program first reads the input values N, X, and M. Then, it initializes an array A of size N+1, with the first element set to X. It then calculates the next elements of the sequence using the recurrence relation given in the problem statement, and stores them in the array. Finally, it calculates and prints the sum of the elements in the array, modulo M, to avoid overflow.\n\nThe pow(A[i-1], 2) % M operation calculates the square of A[i-1], then takes the modulus with M. This ensures that the result is always within the range 0 to M-1.
