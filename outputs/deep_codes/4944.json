The dp[i] represents the minimum number of days to print i statues. We start with dp[1] = 1, because it takes 1 day to print 1 statue. Then we iterate i from 2 to n, and for each i, we try to print each of its previous statues on a new printer, and update dp[i] to be the minimum of dp[i] and dp[i-j] + 1. The \"+1\" represents the day it takes to print the new printer.\n\nThis solution runs in O(n^2) time and uses O(n) space", "def min_days(n):\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = min(dp[i - j] + 1 for j in range(1, i + 1))\n    return dp[n]\n\nprint(min_days(int(input())))\n\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of days needed to print at least `n` statues. The idea is to maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is the minimum number of days needed to print at least `i` statues. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, we try to print a statue using each printer we have, and update `dp[i]` accordingly. The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`.\n\nPlease note that the input and output are handled by the system, and the actual input is provided by the user. The solution assumes that the user provides a valid input.\n\nThis solution is written in Python", "def min_days(n):\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = min(dp[i - j] + 1 for j in range(1, i + 1))\n    return dp[n]\n\nprint(min_days(int(input())))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We define dp[i] as the minimum number of days needed to print at least i statues. For each i, we consider all possible j such that i >= j, and update dp[i] as the minimum of dp[i] and dp[i - j] + 1. The reason we add 1 is that we spend a day to print j statues, and the rest of the days are spent on printing the remaining i - j statues.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), and the space complexity is O(n).\n\nThe code reads an integer n from the input, calls the function min", "def min_days(n):\n    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1\n        j = 2\n        while j*j <= i:\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j*j] + 1)\n            j += 1\n    return dp[n]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_days(n))\n\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of days needed to print at least `i` statues. The base case `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1` is that we need one day to print one statue and one day to print a new printer. For `i > 1`, we have two choices: either we print a statue or we print a new printer. If we print a statue,", "def min_days(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        dp = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                dp.append(min(dp[i-1]+1, dp[i//2]+1))\n            else:\n                dp.append(dp[i-1]+1)\n        return dp[-1]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_days(n))\n\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp list keeps track of the minimum number of days needed to print at least i statues. The base case is dp[1] = 1, as it takes 1 day to print 1 statue. For each i > 1, if i is even, it can be either printed by the current printer or the one made by the previous printer. If i is odd, it can only be printed by the current printer. The minimum number of days is the minimum"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have a single 3D printer, and would like to use it to produce $n$ statues. However, printing the statues one by one on the 3D printer takes a long time, so it may be more time-efficient to first use the 3D printer to print a new printer. That new printer may then in turn be used to print statues or even more printers. Print jobs take a full day, and every day you can choose for each printer in your possession to have it print a statue, or to have it 3D print a new printer (which becomes available for use the next day).\n\nWhat is the minimum possible number of days needed to print at least $n$ statues?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10000$), the number of statues you need to print.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, the minimum number of days needed to print at least $n$ statues.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nSample Output:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
