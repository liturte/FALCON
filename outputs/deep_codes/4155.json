Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0.\nYou are given a sequence h=\\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \\leq  k \\leq N), by repeating the following \"watering\" operation:\n - Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \\leq x \\leq r.\nFind the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N  \\leq 100\n - 0 \\leq h_i \\leq 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nh_1 h_2 h_3 ...... h_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n1 2 2 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nThe minimum number of watering operations required is 2.\nOne way to achieve it is:\n - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(1,3).\n - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(2,4).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
