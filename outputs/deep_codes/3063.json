Now the time has come to pay back all the debts, but the problem is that everybody has spent all of their money!\n\nThe major of Kri\u017e has decided to solve this problem. The town will give money to a few people so that they can pay back their debts. When some people get their money back, a chain reaction is started \u2013 for example: person $A$ gets money from the city. Person $A$ uses that money to pay the debt toward person $B$. Person $B$ then uses that money to pay the debt towards person $C$ etc. If person $B$ didn\u2019t have enough money to pay back the debt, they wait until they get enough. If they have more than enough money, person $B$ will keep what is left after payback.\n\nAnother example: if two people live in Kri\u017e, and they owe $$100$ to each other, the town will give $$100$ to one of them so they can pay back the debt to the other one.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum total amount of money the town has to give to some subset of the inhabitants so that after the payback protocol described above all debts are payed.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of input contains one integer $N$ ($2 \\le N \\le 200000$), number of inhabitants of Kri\u017e. They are numbered from $1$ to $N$.\n\nThe following $N$ lines contain two integers, separated by space. In the $i$\u2019th of those lines, the first number $A_ i$ represents the id of the person $i$\u2019th person owes money to ($1 \\le A_ i \\le N$, $A_ i \\ne i$), and the second number $B_ i$ represents the ammount of the debt in $ ($1 \\le B_ i \\le 10000$).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain one integer \u2013 the minimum total ammount of money town has to give to its inhabitants so all debts are returned.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n2 100\n1 100\n4 70\n3 70\nSample Output 1:\n170\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n2 120\n3 50\n2 80\nSample Output 2:\n150\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
