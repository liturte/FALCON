The dp[i] represents the number of sequences of length i that satisfy the conditions. The base case is dp[0] = 1, which represents the sequence of length 0 (which is an empty sequence). For each i > 0, there are two possibilities: the n-th element is equal to the (n-1)-th element, or it is different. If it is equal, the sequence is extended by one element, so the count is the same as the count for the sequence of length i-1.
