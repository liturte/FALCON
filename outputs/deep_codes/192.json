He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.\n\nIn a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 \u2264 y < x \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n22 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \\rightarrow(6,6,3) \\rightarrow(6,4,3) \\rightarrow(3,4,3) \\rightarrow(3,3,3)$.\n\nIn the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \\rightarrow(8,8,5) \\rightarrow(8,5,5) \\rightarrow(5,5,5)$.\n\nIn the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \\rightarrow(7,22,22) \\rightarrow(7,22,16) \\rightarrow(7,10,16) \\rightarrow(7,10,4) \\rightarrow$\n\n$(7,4,4) \\rightarrow(4,4,4)$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
