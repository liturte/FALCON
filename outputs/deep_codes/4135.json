Your task is to decrypt this string, i.e., to find a string $s$ such that the above algorithm results in string $t$. It can be proven that this string $s$ always exists and is unique.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the length of the string $t$. The second line of input consists of the string $t$. The length of $t$ is $n$, and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a string $s$ such that the above algorithm results in $t$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10\nrocesfedoc\n\nOutput\ncodeforces\n\nInput\n16\nplmaetwoxesisiht\n\nOutput\nthisisexampletwo\n\nInput\n1\nz\n\nOutput\nz\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
