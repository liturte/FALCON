Since the numbers are quite large, the teacher provided him with $N$ smaller integers whose product is $A$, and $M$ integers with product $B$.\n\nMirko would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than $9$ digits long, output only the last $9$ digits.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1000$).\n\nThe second line of input contains $N$ space-separated positive integers less than $1000000000$, whose product is the number $A$.\n\nThe third line of input contains the positive integer $M$ ($1 \\le M \\le 1000$).\n\nThe fourth line of input contains $M$ space-separated positive integers less than $1000000000$, whose product is the number $B$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the greatest common divisor of numbers $A$ and $B$. If the result is more than $9$ digits long, output only the last (least significant) $9$ digits.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2 3 5\n2\n4 5\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n6 2 3 4\n1\n1\nSample Output 2:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
