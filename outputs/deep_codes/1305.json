It reads the number of people and the bills, then it iterates over the bills. If the bill is 25, it does nothing. If the bill is 50, it needs to give 25 back, so it adds 25 to the change.

For each bill, we add its value to the total change we have, minus 25 (since we are giving a 25 ruble bill as change). If at any point, the change we have is less than 0, we return \"NO\" because we cannot give change.

There are n people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 ruble bill. A \"Die Hard\" ticket costs 25 rubles. Can the booking clerk sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of people in the line. The next line contains n integers, each of them equals 25, 50 or 100 \u2014 the values of the bills the people have. The numbers are given in the order from the beginning of the line (at the box office) to the end of the line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the booking clerk can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. Otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n25 25 50 50\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n2\n25 100\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4\n50 50 25 25\n\nOutput\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
