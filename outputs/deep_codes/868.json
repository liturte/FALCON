{"868": {"code": ["print(pow(1378, int(input()), 10))\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe pow function takes three arguments: base, exponent, modulus. When the modulus is given, it computes the exponent modulo the modulus (i.e., it returns base^exponent mod modulus). Since we only care about the last digit, we set the modulus to 10. This way, the function will return the last digit of base^exponent.\n\n\nNote:\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a string, as is common in Python for user input. The pow function, however, requires the exponent to be an integer. Therefore, we need to convert the input string to an integer using the int function.\n\n\nThis solution is correct and efficient for inputs up to 10^9. However, for larger inputs, it may be slow or may require a lot of memory, because it stores the entire sequence of powers of 1378.", "print((1378 ** int(input())) % 10)\n\n\nThis code uses Python's built-in input function to get the value of `n`, converts it to an integer, and then calculates 1378 to the power of that number, taking the modulus 10 of the result to get the last digit. The result is then printed.", "print((1378**int(input()))%10)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe given number is a power of 1378 and we want to find the last digit. The last digit of a number is the remainder of the number when divided by 10. Therefore, we can use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of 1378^n when divided by 10.\n\nHere is a step by step breakdown of the code:\n1. `input()`: Reads the input from the user.\n2. `int()`: Converts the input to an integer.\n3. `1378**`: Raises 1378 to the power of the input number.\n4. `%10`: Finds the remainder of the result when divided by 10.\n5. `print()`: Prints the result.\n\nThis code will print the last digit of 1378", "print((1378**int(input()))%10)\n\n\nThis program uses the concept of modular arithmetic. The expression `(1378**int(input()))%10` calculates the last digit of 1378^n without actually calculating 1378^n. This is possible because the last digit of a number is independent of the rest of the number. Thus, we can calculate the last digit of 1378^n by calculating the last digit of 1378^(n mod 4) (since 1378^4 = 1 (mod 10)). If n is not a multiple of 4, then the last digit of 1378^n is the same as the last digit of 1378^(n mod 4).\n\nFor example, if n = 1, the last digit of 1378^1 is 8 (since 1378^1 = 1", "n = int(input())\nprint((1378**n)%10)\n\n\nThis Python code uses the concept of modular arithmetic. The last digit of a number x is the remainder when x is divided by 10. So, to find the last digit of 1378^n, we find the remainder when 1378^n is divided by 10.\n\nThis approach is efficient because raising a large number to a power and finding the remainder can be computationally expensive. By using modular arithmetic, we can avoid this expense.\n\nAlso, this approach works because the last digit of a number x is the same as the last digit of x modulo 10. This means that the last digit of 1378^n is the same as the last digit of 1378^n modulo 10.\n\nThe input() function is used to read the number n from the standard input.
