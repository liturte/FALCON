However, in the best assignment, shown in Sample Output 2, we let Gaggler $1$ keep their current mentor and instead change the mentors of both Gagglers $2$ and $3$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 500000$), the number of Gagglers. Then follows a line containing $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ n$ ($1 \\le a_ i \\le n$ and $a_ i \\ne i$ for each $i$) where $a_ i$ is the current mentor of Gaggler $i$ (the Gagglers are numbered from $1$ to $n$).\n\n-----Output-----\nThen output a line with the new assignment $b_1, \\ldots , b_ n$ of mentors, in the same format as in the input. The new list should be a valid assignment according to the new requirements, and be the best according to the tie-breaking rule described above.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n2 1 4 3\nSample Output:\n2 3 4 1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
