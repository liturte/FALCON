At the beginning of each turn, a player draws from the drawing pile, which initially contains all cards that have not been dealt face-down. If the player can use the card drawn to fill one of their slots that has not been filled, they uncover and remove the face-down card from the slot and put the drawn card face up in the slot.

Note that Theta bases her decision on only those cards that are turned face-up in a slot and the cards that have been discarded onto the discard pile, but not the face-down cards or the cards remaining in the drawing pile.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single string denoting the shuffled deck, which consists of $52$ characters, with each of A, J, Q, K, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and T appearing exactly $4$ times. Since the suit of a card does not matter for the game, it is not given in the input. 2 - 9 stand for cards $2$ to $9$, T stands for $10$, and A, J, Q, and K stand for Ace, Jack, Queen, and King.\n\nThe first $10$ cards in the deck are dealt face-down to Theta, with the first card in her Ace/$1$ slot, the second card in her $2$ slot, and so on. The next $10$ cards are dealt to her friend, with the $11^{\\texttt{th}}$ in the Ace/$1$ slot, and so on. The $21^{\\texttt{st}}$ card in the deck is the first card drawn. Neither player is allowed to look at their face-down cards. Theta starts the game.\n\nYou are guaranteed that one player will be able to win before the deck runs out of cards.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Theta wins this game with her strategy, output \u201cTheta wins\u201d. Otherwise, output \u201cTheta loses\u201d. Do not add a period to the output.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n23456789TJ23456789TJA89Q66JK37T2A4AQK3AK5T8Q24K97JQ5\nSample Output 1:\nTheta wins\n\nSample Input 2:\n89724TJTA67K4J87Q8T6Q7J2324T558KA99A3KA356QJ6523QK49\nSample Output 2:\nTheta wins\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
