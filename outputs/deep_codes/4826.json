This is because Alice can always take the last stone if it's the only one left, making the number of stones even for Bob.", "print(\"Alice\" if N % 2 == 1 else \"Bob\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe winner is determined by the parity of the number of stones left. If the number of stones is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins. The Python code snippet above implements this logic.\n\nThe operator `%` is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of the division. If `N % 2` is `1`, it means that `N` is odd. Therefore, Alice wins in this case. Otherwise, Bob wins.\n\nThis solution works because the game is a perfect information game, i.e., both Alice and Bob know the complete state of the game at all times. The game can be easily solved by observing the pattern of the game. If there are an even number of stones, Bob can always make a move that leaves an even number of stones, and Alice will lose. If there are an odd number of stones, Bob can only make a move if there are two stones left, and Alice will win.\n\nTherefore, if the number of", "def winner(n):\n    return \"Alice\" if n % 2 == 1 else \"Bob\"\n\nThis code snippet checks if the number of stones is odd. If it is, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins. The function `winner` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string \"Alice\" or \"Bob\" based on the value of `n`.", "def find_winner(N):\n    return \"Alice\" if N%2 == 1 else \"Bob\"\n\nIn this problem, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of stones. If the number of stones is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins. This can be determined using the modulus operator in Python. The function `find_winner(N)` returns the string \"Alice\" if `N` is odd, and \"Bob\" otherwise.\n\nThis solution works by exploiting the fact that the parity of the number of stones is determined by the last bit in the binary representation of the number. When `N` is odd, the last bit is 1, so `N%2` is 1. When `N` is even, the last bit is 0, so `N%2` is 0. Therefore, if `N` is odd, \"Alice\" is returned, and if `N` is even, \"Bob\" is returned.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1), which"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAlice and Bob are playing a new game of stones.
