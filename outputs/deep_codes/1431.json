If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - a_i is 0 or 1.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf a good set of choices does not exist, print -1.\nIf a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:\nM\nb_1 b_2 ... b_M\n\nwhere M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\\ b_2,\\ ...,\\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 0 0\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n1\n\nConsider putting a ball only in the box with 1 written on it.\n - There are three boxes with multiples of 1 written on them: the boxes with 1, 2, and 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 1.\n - There is only one box with a multiple of 2 written on it: the box with 2. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0.\n - There is only one box with a multiple of 3 written on it: the box with 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0.\nThus, the condition is satisfied, so this set of choices is good.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
