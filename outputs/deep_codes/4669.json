Otherwise, the score of this word is 1. The score for the whole list of words is the sum of scores of all words in the list.\nDebug the given function score_words such that it returns a correct score.\nYour function will be tested on several cases by the locked template code.\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe input is read by the provided locked code template. In the first line, there is a single integer n denoting the number of words. In the second line, there are n space-separated lowercase words.\n\n=====Constraints=====\n1\u2264n\u226420\nEach word has at most 20 letters and all letters are English lowercase letters\n\n=====Output Format=====\nThe output is produced by the provided and locked code template. It calls function score_words with the list of words read from the input as the argument and prints the returned score to the output.\nSTARTER CODE:\ndef is_vowel(letter):\n    return letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']\n\ndef score_words(words):\n    score = 0\n    for word in words:\n        num_vowels = 0\n        for letter in word:\n            if is_vowel(letter):\n                num_vowels += 1\n        if num_vowels % 2 == 0:\n            score += 2\n        else:\n            ++score\n    return score\n\n\nn = int(input())\nwords = input().split()\nprint(score_words(words))\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
