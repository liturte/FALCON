If he battles in the first city, his XV will increase by (12*5) = 60.\n\nIf Pikachu trains in the first city, and then battles in the second city, his XV will increase by 39*10 = 390. So, the final XV will be 0+390 = 390. You can check that you cannot do better than this. Hence the answer is 390.\n\nInput 2:\n4 1\n100 1 6 2\n\nOutput 2:\n120\n\n-----Explanation 2-----\nPikachu battles in the first city, trains in the second and third, and then battles in the fourth city. So his strength going into each of the four cities is (1, 1, 2, 10). And so he gains 1*100 XV from the first city and 10*2 XV from the fourth city. This gets him a total of 120 XV, and you can verify that nothing better can be done.\n\nNote:\nYou may download the problem statements PDF and test cases zipped files here: http://pd.codechef.com/com/inoi/problems.zip.
