{"4231": {"code": ["H, W = map(int, input().split())\nh, w = map(int, input().split())\nprint((H-h+1)*(W-w+1))\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input for the total number of rows and columns (H, W), and the number of rows and columns to be painted (h, w). It then calculates the number of remaining cells by subtracting the number of painted rows and columns from the total number of rows and columns, respectively. The \"+1\" is added to account for the possibility of painting the last row or column. The result is then printed.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be in the correct format and within the given constraints. It does not include any error checking or handling of invalid input.", "H, W = map(int, input().split())\nh, w = map(int, input().split())\nprint((H-h+1)*(W-w+1))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code first reads the total number of rows and columns, H and W, as well as the number of rows and columns to be painted, h and w. It then calculates the number of white cells remaining by subtracting the number of rows and columns to be painted from the total number of rows and columns, respectively, and adding 1 to each result (since the range is inclusive). The product of these two results gives the total number of white cells remaining.\n\nThe plus 1 is needed because the range is inclusive, meaning the endpoints h and w are included in the range. Without the plus 1, the range would exclude the endpoints, which would lead to incorrect results.\n\nFor example, if H=3, W=2, h=2, w=1, the total number of white cells is (H-h+1)*(W-w+1) = (3-2+1)*(2-1+1) = 2*2 = 4. However, if h=3, w=2,", "H, W = map(int, input().split())\nh, w = map(int, input().split())\nprint((H - h + 1) * (W - w + 1))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is asking for the number of ways to select a sub-grid from a grid of H rows and W columns. The sub-grid can be of any size, but it must have at least one row and one column. The number of ways to choose a sub-grid of h rows and w columns from a grid of H rows and W columns is (H - h + 1) * (W - w + 1). This is because there are (H - h + 1) ways to choose the starting row of the sub-grid, and for each of these ways, there are (W - w + 1) ways to choose the starting column of the sub-grid.\n\"\"\"# \u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\nwith open('sample.txt', 'r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n\n# \u884c\u6570\u3092\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\nnum_lines = len(lines", "H, W = map(int, input().split())\nh, w = map(int", "H, W = map(int, input().split())\nh, w = map(int, input().split())\nprint((H - h + 1) * (W - w + 1))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of white cells that remain is calculated by subtracting the number of rows and columns that are chosen from the total number of rows and columns, then multiplying by the number of cells in the remaining rows and columns. The `+1` is used to include the chosen rows and columns in the calculation.\n\nThis is because you're choosing h rows and w columns, and the remaining cells are the ones that are not part of these chosen rows or columns. The `+1` is used to include the chosen rows or columns in the count.\n\nFor example, if you have 3 rows and 2 columns and you choose 2 rows and 1 column, the remaining cells are the ones that are not part of the chosen rows or columns. In this case, there are 1*1 = 1 remaining cells.\n\nThe `map()` function is used to convert the input strings into integers.
