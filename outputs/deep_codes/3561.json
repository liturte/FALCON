His possessions consist of $W$ wolves, $S$ sheep, and $C$ cabbages. The transportation will be carried out using a boat that can hold up to $K$ of these items at the same time. During each step, John can take some items from one bank and transfer them to the other bank. Unfortunately, when left unsupervised, wolves will eat sheep and sheep will eat cabbages (but wolves don\u2019t eat cabbages). John doesn\u2019t want to lose his possessions, so he has to devise a scheme such that this doesn\u2019t happen. With John present, any combination of items is allowed (both on the bank and in the boat). This is also true during the loading process. Since John isn\u2019t very good at solving problems like this, he asks you to help him.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput contains a single line with four integers: $W$, $S$, $C$, $K$. The input satisfies the following constraints:\\[ 0 \\leq W, S, C, K \\leq 10^6, \\]\\[ 1 \\leq max(W, S, C). \\]\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it\u2019s possible to perform the transportation without the loss of items, print YES, otherwise print NO.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1 1 1 1\nSample Output:\nYES\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
