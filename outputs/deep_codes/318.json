It then adds the minutes to the current minutes, taking into account that if the sum of minutes is more than 60, it means that an hour has passed.\n\nThe program then calculates the number of hours that have passed, and adds this number to the current hours.

It then calculates the new total minutes (by adding the minutes and the number of minutes to add), and uses floor division and modulus operations to calculate the new hours and minutes. The modulus operation is used to ensure that the hours stay within the range 0-23.

The strptime function is used to convert the input string to a datetime object, which can be manipulated. The timedelta function is used to add the specified number of minutes to the time, and the strftime function is used to convert the resulting datetime", "h, m = map(int, input().split(\":\"))\na = int(input())\n\nh += (m + a) // 60\nm = (m + a) % 60\n\nprint(f\"{h%24:02d}:{m:02d}\")\n\n\nThis code works by first reading the current time and the number of minutes to add.

Find and print the time after a minutes.\n\nNote that you should find only the time after a minutes, see the examples to clarify the problem statement.\n\nYou can read more about 24-hour format here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the current time in the format hh:mm (0 \u2264 hh < 24, 0 \u2264 mm < 60). The hours and the minutes are given with two digits (the hours or the minutes less than 10 are given with the leading zeroes).\n\nThe second line contains integer a (0 \u2264 a \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of the minutes passed.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line should contain the time after a minutes in the format described in the input. Note that you should print exactly two digits for the hours and the minutes (add leading zeroes to the numbers if needed).\n\nSee the examples to check the input/output format.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n23:59\n10\n\nOutput\n00:09\n\nInput\n20:20\n121\n\nOutput\n22:21\n\nInput\n10:10\n0\n\nOutput\n10:10\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
