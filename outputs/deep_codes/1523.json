These idlers are incredibly lazy and create many problems to their ruler, the mighty King of Lazyland. \n\nToday $k$ important jobs for the kingdom ($k \\le n$) should be performed. Every job should be done by one person and every person can do at most one job. The King allowed every idler to choose one job they wanted to do and the $i$-th idler has chosen the job $a_i$. \n\nUnfortunately, some jobs may not be chosen by anyone, so the King has to persuade some idlers to choose another job. The King knows that it takes $b_i$ minutes to persuade the $i$-th idler. He asked his minister of labour to calculate the minimum total time he needs to spend persuading the idlers to get all the jobs done. Can you help him? \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of idlers and the number of jobs.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le k$)\u00a0\u2014 the jobs chosen by each idler.\n\nThe third line of the input contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the time the King needs to spend to persuade the $i$-th idler.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line of the output should contain one number\u00a0\u2014 the minimum total time the King needs to spend persuading the idlers to get all the jobs done.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 7\n1 1 3 1 5 3 7 1\n5 7 4 8 1 3 5 2\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n3 3\n3 1 2\n5 3 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the optimal plan is to persuade idlers 1, 6, and 8 to do jobs 2, 4, and 6.\n\nIn the second example each job was chosen by some idler, so there is no need to persuade anyone.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
