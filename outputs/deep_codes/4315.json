The math.pi constant is used for the value of \u03c0.\n\nThe print function is used to output the result of the calculation.

The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of \u03c0.\n\nThe script uses the `int` function to convert the input to an integer, since the radius must be an integer.\n\nThe script uses the `print` function to output the calculated circumference. The `print` function automatically includes a newline at the end, so there is no need to include one.\n\nThe script does not include any error checking, so it assumes that the input will be a valid integer between 1 and 100. If the input is not a valid integer, or if it is not between 1 and 100, the script will not behave correctly.\n\nThis script is a direct translation of the problem statement into Python code. It does not include any optimizations or improvements that could be made for a real-world application.\n\nThis script uses the `math` module, which provides access to the mathematical functions and constants defined by the C standard.
