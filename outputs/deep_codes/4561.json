If it was within the best-by date and not later than that, it is considered delicious. If it was eaten within the time limits but not within the best-by date, it is considered safe. If it was eaten later than the time limits, it is considered dangerous.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input", "X, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B <= X:\n    print(\"delicious\")\nelif A + B <= X + B:\n    print(\"safe\")\nelse:\nprint(\"dangerous\")\n\n\nThis code reads the input values X, A, and B. If A + B is less than or equal to X, Takahashi found the food delicious, and the program prints \"delicious\". If A + B is greater than X, but less than or equal to X + B, Takahashi ate the food before its \"best-by\" date but did not get a stomachache, and the program prints \"safe\".

If A + B is less than or equal to X, Takahashi found the food delicious. If A + B is less than or equal to X + 1, he was not harmed by the food but did not find it delicious. If A + B is greater than X + 1, he got a stomachache. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input is valid. If you want to handle invalid input, you should add error checking code.", "X, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B <= X:\n    print('delicious')\nelif A + B <= X +1:\n    print('safe')\nelse:\n print('dangerous')\n\n\nThis code first checks if the total number of days Takahashi ate the food (A + B) is less than or equal to X. If it is, it prints 'delicious'. If not, it checks if the total is less than or equal to X + 1. If it is, it prints 'safe'. If the total is more than X + 1, it prints 'dangerous'.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be in the format specified in the problem statement. If there is a possibility that the input could be in a different format, you would need to add", "X, A, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nif A < X and B <= X:\n    print(\"delicious\")\nelif A >= X or B > X:\n    print(\"dangerous\")\nelse:\n    print(\"safe\")\n\n\nThis solution works by reading in the input values X, A, and B. It then checks if the food was eaten within the safe time frame (A < X and B <= X) or if it was left to expire (A >= X or B > X). It then prints the appropriate message based on these conditions.\n\nThe first condition is the safe case where the food is eaten before its best-by date and not left to expire. The second condition is the dangerous case where the food is either left to expire or eaten after its best-by date. The"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi has a strong stomach.
