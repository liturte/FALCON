Both h and w are at most 100.\n - The set of the squares painted white is divided into exactly A connected components.\n - The set of the squares painted black is divided into exactly B connected components.\nIt can be proved that there always exist one or more solutions under the conditions specified in Constraints section.\nIf there are multiple solutions, any of them may be printed.\n\n-----Notes-----\nTwo squares painted white, c_1 and c_2, are called connected when the square c_2 can be reached from the square c_1 passing only white squares by repeatedly moving up, down, left or right to an adjacent square.\nA set of squares painted white, S, forms a connected component when the following conditions are met:\n - Any two squares in S are connected.\n - No pair of a square painted white that is not included in S and a square included in S is connected.\nA connected component of squares painted black is defined similarly.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq A \\leq 500\n - 1 \\leq B \\leq 500\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should be in the following format:\n - In the first line, print integers h and w representing the size of the grid you constructed, with a space in between.\n - Then, print h more lines. The i-th (1 \\leq i \\leq h) of these lines should contain a string s_i as follows:\n - If the square at the i-th row and j-th column (1 \\leq j \\leq w) in the grid is painted white, the j-th character in s_i should be ..\n - If the square at the i-th row and j-th column (1 \\leq j \\leq w) in the grid is painted black, the j-th character in s_i should be #.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3 3\n##.\n..#\n#.#\n\nThis output corresponds to the grid below:\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
