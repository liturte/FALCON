Thus, the ABC number of T is 3.\nYou are given a string S. Each character of S is A, B, C or ?.\nLet Q be the number of occurrences of ? in S. We can make 3^Q strings by replacing each occurrence of ? in S with A, B or C. Find the sum of the ABC numbers of all these strings.\nThis sum can be extremely large, so print the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 3 \u2264 |S| \u2264 10^5\n - Each character of S is A, B, C or ?.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the sum of the ABC numbers of all the 3^Q strings, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nA??C\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n8\n\nIn this case, Q = 2, and we can make 3^Q = 9 strings by by replacing each occurrence of ? with A, B or C. The ABC number of each of these strings is as follows:\n - AAAC: 0\n - AABC: 2\n - AACC: 0\n - ABAC: 1\n - ABBC: 2\n - ABCC: 2\n - ACAC: 0\n - ACBC: 1\n - ACCC: 0\nThe sum of these is 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 8, so we print 8 modulo 10^9 + 7, that is, 8.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
