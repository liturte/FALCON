For example, when you hear someone saying this mysterious number 1010110001 (which is in binary), can you quickly convert it to its decimal form, 689?\n\nIn Harkerland, everyone uses the octal numeral system (base $8$) when talking about numbers. Therefore, new immigrants often have difficulties parsing numbers quickly. One of them is Alex. Alex used to live in a place where the hexadecimal numeral system (base $16$) is adopted. In order to adapt to the Harkerland lifestyle as soon as possible, he trains hard to perform fast octal-to-hexadecimal conversion. Before Alex\u2019s training finishes, he is going to rely on a program for the base conversion. Help Alex write such a program.\n\nUse capital letters A, B, $\\dots $, F to represent the values $10, 11, \\ldots , 15$ in hexadecimal.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe only line of input consists of a non-negative integer, written in base $8$. The given integer will have no leading zeroes and will be strictly smaller than $8^{200000}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the same integer, written in base $16$. The output must not include any extra leading zeroes.\n\n-----Explanation for sample data-----\nFor Sample Input 1, $4444_8 = 2340_{10} = 924_{16}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4444\nSample Output 1:\n924\n\nSample Input 2:\n20\nSample Output 2:\n10\n\nSample Input 3:\n3211\nSample Output 3:\n689\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
