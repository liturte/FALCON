After each addition, it takes the modulo with respect to MOD (998244353) to ensure that the total remains manageable. The final result is then printed.\n\nThe complexity of this code is O(ABC), which is feasible for the given constraints.\n\nThe code uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible values of a, b, and c, and uses a single variable to store the running total.

In this case, we are summing over three variables A, B, and C.\n\nThe three sums are nested in the order A, B, C. For each of the three sums, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the sum, and then take this sum modulo MOD (998244353).\n\nThe result is the product of the three sums, each taken modulo MOD at each step to avoid overflow. This product is also taken modulo MOD at the end to keep the result within the 99824435", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 998244353\nprint((A * B * (C * (C + 1) // 2) % MOD * C % MOD + A * (B * (B + 1) // 2) % MOD * C % MOD + A * B * (B + 1) // 2 % MOD) % MOD)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe question requires us to find the sum of all products of three integers a, b, and c such that 1 <= a <= A, 1 <= b <= B and 1 <= c <= C.\n\nThe sum can be broken down into three parts:\n\n1. abc for all a in [1, A], b in [1, B] and c in [1, C]\n2. abc for all a in [1, A] and all b in [1, B] and c in [1, C]\n3. abc for all a in [1,", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 998244353\nprint((((A * (A + 1) // 2) % MOD) * B * C) % MOD)\n\n\nThis solution works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is n*(n+1)/2. This formula is used to calculate the sum of the products of the three variables a, b, and c, for all possible combinations of a, b, and c. The result is then taken modulo 998244353 to ensure it fits within the constraints of the problem.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and the result.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is given as three space-separated integers on a single line. If the input is given in a different format, the code will need", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 998244353\nprint(((A * B * (B + 1) // 2) % MOD) * C % MOD)\n\n\nThis code works by calculating the sum of the products of the three variables using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, then applying the modulo operation. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n*(n+1)/2, which is used to calculate the sum of the products of the first two variables. The result is then multiplied by the third variable and the modulo operation is applied again.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be a string of three space-separated integers. The split() function is used to divide the string into parts based on spaces, and the map() function is used to apply the int() function to each part, converting them to integers. The result is a tuple of three integers, which is unpacked into the variables A, B, and C.\n\nThe modulo operation is used to ensure"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven are three positive integers A, B, and C.
