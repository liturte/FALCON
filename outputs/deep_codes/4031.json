Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.\n\nString $a$ is a substring of string $b$ if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in $b$ in such a way that they form $a$. For example, string \"for\" is contained as a substring in strings \"codeforces\", \"for\" and \"therefore\", but is not contained as a substring in strings \"four\", \"fofo\" and \"rof\".\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of strings.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.\n\nSome strings might be equal.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reorder $n$ given strings in required order, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and $n$ given strings in required order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\na\naba\nabacaba\nba\naba\n\nOutput\nYES\na\nba\naba\naba\nabacaba\n\nInput\n5\na\nabacaba\nba\naba\nabab\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n3\nqwerty\nqwerty\nqwerty\n\nOutput\nYES\nqwerty\nqwerty\nqwerty\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string \"abab\" is not a substring of the string \"abacaba\".\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
