The i-th element of a (1-indexed) is a_{i}.\nHe can perform the following operation any number of times:\n - Operation: Choose integers x and y between 1 and N (inclusive), and add a_x to a_y.\nHe would like to perform this operation between 0 and 2N times (inclusive) so that a satisfies the condition below. Show one such sequence of operations.\nIt can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.\n - Condition: a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq ...  \\leq a_{N}\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 50\n - -10^{6} \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{6}\n - All input values are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_{N}\n\n-----Output-----\nLet m be the number of operations in your solution. In the first line, print m.\nIn the i-th of the subsequent m lines, print the numbers x and y chosen in the i-th operation, with a space in between.\nThe output will be considered correct if m is between 0 and 2N (inclusive) and a satisfies the condition after the m operations.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n-2 5 -1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n2 3\n3 3\n\n - After the first operation, a = (-2,5,4).\n - After the second operation, a = (-2,5,8), and the condition is now satisfied.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
