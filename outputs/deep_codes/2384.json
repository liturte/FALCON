The state of dp[i] is the maximum sum we can get by choosing from the first i elements.

If we choose it, we cannot choose the (i-1)-th element. So we add the (i-1)-th element's maximum sum (dp[i-1][", "def max_sum(n, a):\n    if n == 1:\n        return a[0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return max(a[0], a[1])\n    else:\n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[0] = a[0]\n        dp[1] = max(a[0], a[1])\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + a[i])\n        return dp[-1]\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max_sum(n, a))\n\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp array stores the maximum sum of the chosen elements up to the current position. The base cases are when there are 1 or 2 elements in the sequence, in which case the maximum sum is the maximum of the two elements. For larger sequences, the maximum sum at position i is either the sum at position i-1 (if the current element", "def max_sum(n, seq):\n    if n == 1:\n        return seq[0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return max(seq[0], seq[1])\n    else:\n        dp = [0]*n\n        dp[0] = seq[0]\n        dp[1] = max(seq[0], seq[1])\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+seq[i])\n        return dp[-1]\n\nn = int(input())\nseq = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max_sum(n, seq))\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to keep track of the maximum sum that can be obtained by choosing 0, 1, 2, ..., i elements from the sequence, where i ranges from 0 to n.
