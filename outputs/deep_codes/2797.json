{"2797": {"code": ["a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((a * (a + 1) // 2) ** b % a)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the expression, we have a geometric series $(1^b + 2^b + \\cdots + a^b)$. The sum of the geometric series is given by $\\frac{a * (a + 1) / 2}{1}$. Since the base of the series is 1, we can simplify the expression to $a * (a + 1) / 2$. After simplifying, we raise this to the power of $b$ and then take the modulus with respect to $a$. This can be done using the Python built-in function pow() with three arguments, which is more efficient than the ** operator. The result is the value of the expression.\n\nThe Python code snippet provided above takes the inputs $a$ and $b$, calculates the value of the expression and outputs it.\n\nThe modulus operation is used to prevent overflow for large values of $a$. It essentially gives the remainder", "def solve(a, b):\n    return (a * a) % a\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(a, b))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe expression is basically a^b % a. When b is odd, the result is always 0. When b is even, the result is a^2 % a which is always a. So, the output is always 0.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that if b is even, a^b % a is equal to (a^2)^(b/2) % a, which is always a, and if b is odd, a^b % a is equal to a * a^(b-1) % a, which is always 0.\n\nThis solution runs in constant time, so it is efficient even for large inputs.\n\nNOTE: This is a special case of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, where a=1, b=2, and c=0. This is a special case because in the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the moduli must be pairwise", "def evaluate_expression(a, b):\n    return (a * (a + 1) // 2) ** b % a\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(evaluate_expression(a, b))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is a famous mathematical problem known as the sum of powers. The expression (1^b + 2^b + ... + a^b) mod a can be simplified by using the formula of the sum of powers: (a * (a + 1) / 2) ^ b mod a. This formula simplifies the expression to a constant value, which can be computed in constant time.\n\nThis code reads the values of a and b from the input, calculates the result of the expression using the evaluate_expression function, and then prints the result. The input and output are separated by a single space.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(1), which means it runs in constant time regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThe space complexity of this code is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space.", "def solve(a, b):\n    return pow(a, b, a)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(a, b))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by using the modular exponentiation. In Python, you can use the built-in `pow()` function with three arguments `pow(x, y, z)`, which computes `(x**y) % z` in a more efficient way. In this case, we want to compute `(a**b) % a`, which is equivalent to `a**b` mod `a`. We use `pow()` function to calculate this efficiently.\n\nThe `map()` function is used to convert the input string into two integers `a` and `b`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string by spaces, and `map()` applies the `int()` function to each resulting string, converting them to integers.\n\nFinally, we call `solve()` with `a` and `b` as arguments and print the result", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((a*(a+1)//2)**b % a)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe expression is a common mathematical pattern known as the sum of powers. It can be calculated using the formula: \n\n$1^b + 2^b + ... + a^b = \\sum_{i=1}^{a} i^b$\n\nHowever, when $b$ is large, this sum can be very large. Therefore, it is often useful to use modulo arithmetic, which allows us to calculate the remainder of the sum when divided by $a$.\n\nIn Python, the modulo operation is represented by the percent symbol. The expression `(a*(a+1)//2)**b % a` calculates the sum of powers modulo $a$. This expression can be calculated more efficiently than calculating the sum of powers directly, especially for large values of $b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 2$ and $b = 3$, the sum of powers is $1^3 + 2^3 ="], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nOne day you and GTmac walk into a classroom and see a mysterious expression on the blackboard:\\[ (1^b + 2^b + \\cdots + a^b)~ \\mathrm{mod}~ a \\]\n\nUpon seeing the expression GTmac shows an evil smile and challenges you: \u201cLet me give you the values of $a$ and $b$ and let\u2019s assume $b$ is an odd number.
