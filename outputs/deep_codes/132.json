At one of the breaks they decided to order a pizza. In this problem pizza is a circle of some radius. The pizza was delivered already cut into n pieces. The i-th piece is a sector of angle equal to a_{i}. Vasya and Petya want to divide all pieces of pizza into two continuous sectors in such way that the difference between angles of these sectors is minimal. Sector angle is sum of angles of all pieces in it. Pay attention, that one of sectors can be empty.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 360) \u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces into which the delivered pizza was cut.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 360) \u00a0\u2014 the angles of the sectors into which the pizza was cut. The sum of all a_{i} is 360.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u00a0\u2014 the minimal difference between angles of sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n90 90 90 90\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\n100 100 160\n\nOutput\n40\n\nInput\n1\n360\n\nOutput\n360\n\nInput\n4\n170 30 150 10\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first sample Vasya can take 1 and 2 pieces, Petya can take 3 and 4 pieces. Then the answer is |(90 + 90) - (90 + 90)| = 0.\n\nIn third sample there is only one piece of pizza that can be taken by only one from Vasya and Petya. So the answer is |360 - 0| = 360.\n\nIn fourth sample Vasya can take 1 and 4 pieces, then Petya will take 2 and 3 pieces. So the answer is |(170 + 10) - (30 + 150)| = 0.\n\nPicture explaning fourth sample:\n\n[Image]\n\nBoth red and green sectors consist of two adjacent pieces of pizza. So Vasya can take green sector, then Petya will take red sector.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
