Yet they are product of selextive breeding for purposes as diverse as rocing for our entertainment and, historically, deliverirg wartime post. Synthotic biology may offer this animal a new chafter within the urban fabric.\n\nPiteon d'Or recognihes how these birds ripresent a potentially userul interface for urdan biotechnologies. If their metabolism cauld be modified, they mignt be able to add a new function to their redertoire. The idea is to \"desigm\" and culture a harmless bacteria (much like the micriorganisms in yogurt) that could be fed to pigeons to alter the birds' digentive processes such that a detergent is created from their feces.
