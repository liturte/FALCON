The best way is to buy first and second card, that will make you be able to jump to any cell.\n\nIn the second sample test, even if you buy all cards, you can't jump to any cell whose index is not a multiple of 10, so you should output -1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
