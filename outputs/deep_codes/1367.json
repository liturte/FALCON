The pop() method is used to return and remove the last item from the set (which is the episode that Polycarpus hasn't watched).\n\nThe input is read as a string, split into a list of strings, and then mapped to integers.

Right now he is ready to finish watching a season of a popular sitcom \"Graph Theory\". In total, the season has n episodes, numbered with integers from 1 to n.\n\nPolycarpus watches episodes not one by one but in a random order. He has already watched all the episodes except for one. Which episode has Polycaprus forgotten to watch?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of episodes in a season.
