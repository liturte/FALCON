Robin\u2019s stopwatch has a single button. Pressing the button alternates between stopping and starting the stopwatch\u2019s timer. When the timer is on, the displayed time increases by 1 every second.\n\nInitially the stopwatch is stopped and the timer reads 0 seconds. Given a sequence of times that the stopwatch button is pressed, determine what the stopwatch\u2019s timer displays.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$), which is the number of times the stopwatch was pressed.\n\nThe next $N$ lines describe the times the stopwatch\u2019s button was pressed in increasing order. Each line contains a single integer $t$ ($0 \\leq t \\leq 10^6$), which is the time the button was pressed. No two button presses happen on the same second.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay still running if the stopwatch\u2019s timer is still running after all button presses were made. Otherwise display the number of seconds displayed on the stopwatch\u2019s timer.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n7\n11\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n2\n5\n9\n10\n17\nSample Output 2:\nstill running\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
