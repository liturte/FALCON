The integers from 1 through N are written on the white balls, one on each ball, and they are also written on the black balls, one on each ball.\nThe integer written on the i-th ball from the left (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2N) is a_i, and the color of this ball is represented by a letter c_i.\nc_i = W represents the ball is white; c_i = B represents the ball is black.\nTakahashi the human wants to achieve the following objective:\n - For every pair of integers (i,j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, the white ball with i written on it is to the left of the white ball with j written on it.\n - For every pair of integers (i,j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, the black ball with i written on it is to the left of the black ball with j written on it.\nIn order to achieve this, he can perform the following operation:\n - Swap two adjacent balls.\nFind the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\n - 1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 N\n - c_i = W or c_i = B.\n - If i \u2260 j, (a_i,c_i) \u2260 (a_j,c_j).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nc_1 a_1\nc_2 a_2\n:\nc_{2N} a_{2N}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\nB 1\nW 2\nB 3\nW 1\nW 3\nB 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\nThe objective can be achieved in four operations, for example, as follows:\n - Swap the black 3 and white 1.\n - Swap the white 1 and white 2.\n - Swap the black 3 and white 3.\n - Swap the black 3 and black 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
