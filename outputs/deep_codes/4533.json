But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\n\n\nNote:\nYou may assume the greed factor is always positive. \nYou cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,2,3], [1,1]\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \nAnd even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\nYou need to output 1.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2], [1,2,3]\n\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. \nYou have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, \nYou need to output 2.\nSTARTER CODE:\nclass Solution:\n    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
