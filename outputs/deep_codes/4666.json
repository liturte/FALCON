It checks if the number is odd (n%2==1), or if it's even and in the range 6-20 inclusive. If either of these conditions are met, it prints \"We", "#!/bin/python3\n\nimport math\nimport os\nimport random\nimport re\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n%2 != 0 or (n >= 6 and n <= 20):\n        print(\"Weird\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Not Weird\")\n\n\nThis code works by first checking if the number is odd (n%2 != 0). If it is, it prints \"Weird\". If the number is even, it then checks if it is in the inclusive range of 6 to 20. If it is, it prints \"Weird\". Otherwise, it prints \"Not Weird\".\n\nThis code does not use a dictionary or any other data structure to map the conditions to their corresponding outputs. Instead, it uses a simple if-else construct to handle the conditions.\n\nThe conditions are checked in order, and the first one that is true determines the output. This", "#!/bin/python3\n\nimport math\nimport os\nimport random\nimport re\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    print(\"Weird\" if n%2==1 or (n>=6 and n<=20) else \"Not Weird\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code first checks if n is odd (n%2==1). If it is, it prints \"Weird\". If it's not, it checks if n is between 6 and 20 (n>=6 and n<=20). If it is, it prints \"Weird\". Otherwise, it prints \"Not Weird\". This is done using a conditional expression (print statement) that evaluates to the result of the condition.\n\nThe condition is a logical OR (or) operation, so it will be True if either of the conditions is True. If n is odd, the first condition is True and the whole condition", "#!/bin/python3\n\nimport math\nimport os\nimport random\nimport re\nimport sys\n\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    check = {True: \"Not Weird\", False: \"Weird\"}\n\n    print(check[\n            n%2==0 and (\n                n in range(6,21)\n        ])\n\n\n\nThis solution works by first checking if n is even (n%2==0). If n is even, it then checks if n is in the range of 6 to 20 (n in range(6,21)). The result of these checks are then used to index into the check dictionary to print the appropriate message.\n\nNote: The range of 6 to 20 is chosen because we want to include 20 in the range, as we are checking for numbers less than or equal to 20.\n\nThe solution does not explicitly handle", "#!/bin/python3\n\nimport math\nimport os\nimport random\nimport re\nimport sys\n\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    check = {True: \"Not Weird\", False: \"Weird\"}\n\n    print(check[\n            n%2==0 and (\n                n in range(6,21)\n        ])\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe condition n%2==0 checks if the number is even. Then, n in range(6,21) checks if the number is in the inclusive range of 6 to 20. The whole expression inside the square brackets is True only when the number is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, which means it's \"Weird\". So, we print \"Weird\" if the condition is True and \"Not Weird\" if it's False.\n\nThis is how we can write"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\n=====Problem Statement=====\nGiven an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:\nIf n is odd, print Weird\nIf n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird\nIf n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird\nIf n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird\n\n=====Input Format=====\nA single line containing a positive integer, n.\n\n=====Constraints=====\n1\u2264n\u2264100\n\n=====Output Format=====\nPrint Weird if the number is weird.
