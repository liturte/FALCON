Chef has decided to be a freelancer and work remotely. According to chef\u2019s maths, he should be able to work on maximum tasks assuming that he can only work on a single task at a time. \nAssume that chef does N tasks. The start and finish time units of those tasks are given. Select the maximum number of tasks that can be performed by a chef, assuming that a he can only work on a single task at a time.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first input contains of size of array N representing the total number of tasks.\n- The second and third lines contains N space-seperated integers representing the starting and finish time of the the tasks.\n\n-----Output:-----\nA single line containing indices of tasks that chef will be able to do.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- Note: The lists have been sorted based on the ending times of the tasks.\n\n-----Sample Input 1:-----\n3\n\n10 12 20\n\n20 25 30  \n\n-----Sample Output 1:-----\n0  2 \n\n-----Sample Input 2:-----\n6\n\n1 2 0 6 3 7\n\n2 4 5 7 9 10  \n\n-----Sample Output 2:-----\n0  1  3  5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
