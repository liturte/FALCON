Mirko is under the impression that certain political parties are going to keep their promises, those regarding informatization and digitalization, which is why he thinks that this year\u2019s essays are going to be marked by a computer, instead of a human.\n\nTo test his doubts, Mirko is going to write an essay that doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense at all, but should pass the automatic basic conditions check. The essay passes the check if\n - it contains at least $A$, and at most $B$ words;\n - every word contains at least one, and at most 15 letters;\n - the used vocabulary is large enough, in other words, the essay contains at least $B/2$ different words.\n\nMirko was up late last night watching Big Brother, so he is asking you to write such an essay instead of him. The essay should be output in a single line, using only lowercase letters of the English alphabet and spaces (therefore, without punctuation such as dots, commas and such). The words used can, but need not be, words from the English (or any) language.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input contains the integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 100000$) from the task.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain any essay that meets the rules from the task.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 7\nSample Output 1:\ndobar je ovaj marko marulic\n\nSample Input 2:\n26 30\nSample Output 2:\nnama je profesor reko da to ne treba za lektiru al onda je bila buka i nisam ga cuo pa jel bi mi mogli dat bodove\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
