The fresh air and lovely sounds make the forest his favourite location. Mislav has decided to spend this afternoon in a forest and, because he\u2019s so practical, he\u2019s also decided to stuff himself with food. His belly can contain $C$ amount of food.\n\nHe will have the opportunity to eat various fruits of nature (mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, and so on) while walking through the forest. All fruits are mutually different given their type and he\u2019d like to eat as much different fruits as possible, but with the condition that he doesn\u2019t overeat. In other words, the total weight of the fruits he\u2019s eaten must not be larger than $C$. Also, when Mislav decides to start eating, he tries to eat every next fruit if it\u2019s possible to eat it and not overeat. In the case when he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to eat it, he just moves on.\n\nAn array of weights of $N$ fruits represents the weight and order of fruits that Mislav came across in the forest. Determine the maximum amount of different fruits that Mislav can eat.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $C$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$, $1 \\leq C \\leq 1000000$) from the task. The second line contains $N$ integers $w_ i$ ($1 \\leq w_ i \\leq 1000$) that represent the fruits\u2019 weight.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the maximum possible amount of different fruits that Mislav can eat.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 5\n3 1 2 1 1\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 5\n1 5 4 3 2 1 1\nSample Output 2:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
