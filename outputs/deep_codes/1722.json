This can be achieved, for example, by putting everyone except jose in one classroom, and jose in the other, so jorge and jerry form the only chatty pair.\n\nIn the second sample the minimum number of pairs is $2$. This can be achieved, for example, by putting kambei, gorobei, shichiroji and kyuzo in one room and putting heihachi, katsushiro and kikuchiyo in the other room. In this case the two pairs are kambei and kyuzo, and katsushiro and kikuchiyo.\n\nIn the third sample the minimum number of pairs is $4$. This can be achieved by placing three of the students named mike in one classroom and the other two students in another classroom. Thus there will be three chatty pairs in one classroom and one chatty pair in the other classroom.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
