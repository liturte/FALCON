The rain is collected in a vertical transparent tube with millimeter markings, and once the rain has stopped falling, one can check the height of the water in the tube.\n\nIn our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height $L$ millimeters (mm). If the water level is above the leak then water drains from the tube at a rate of $K$ millimeters per hour (mm/h).\n\nWe want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular rainfall. We assume that the tube is high enough that it does not overflow. We also assume that rain falls at an (unknown) uniform rate during a rainfall, and that water does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the leak itself is also negligible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is a line with five positive numbers: $L$ $K$ $T_1$ $T_2$ $H$ where$L$\n\nis where the leak is (mm)$K$\n\nis the rate at which water leaks (mm/h)$T_1$\n\nis the duration of the rainfall (h)$T_2$\n\nis the time between the end of the rainfall and the observation of the water level (h)$H$\n\nis the water level in the tube when we observe it (mm)\n\nEach number is at least $0.01$ and at most $1000.00$, and each is given with exactly two decimals.\n\n-----Output-----\nOne line with two floating point numbers $F_1$ $F_2$ where $F_1$ is the smallest rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given observation, and $F_2$ is the largest rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given observation. Values with either absolute or relative error smaller than $10^{-6}$ are acceptable.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n80.00 0.50 2.00 1.50 80.00\nSample Output:\n80.000000 80.759403\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
