The wall consists of $N$ pillars of bricks, the height of the $i$-th pillar is initially equal to $h_{i}$, the height is measured in number of bricks. After the restoration all the $N$ pillars should have equal heights.\n\nYou are allowed the following operations: put a brick on top of one pillar, the cost of this operation is $A$; remove a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar, the cost of this operation is $R$; move a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar to the top of another pillar, the cost of this operation is $M$.\n\nYou cannot create additional pillars or ignore some of pre-existing pillars even if their height becomes $0$.\n\nWhat is the minimal total cost of restoration, in other words, what is the minimal total cost to make all the pillars of equal height?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains four integers $N$, $A$, $R$, $M$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^{5}$, $0 \\le A, R, M \\le 10^{4}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pillars and the costs of operations.\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers $h_{i}$ ($0 \\le h_{i} \\le 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 initial heights of pillars.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal cost of restoration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1 100 100\n1 3 8\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n3 100 1 100\n1 3 8\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n3 100 100 1\n1 3 8\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 1 2 4\n5 5 3 6 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 1 2 2\n5 5 3 6 5\n\nOutput\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
