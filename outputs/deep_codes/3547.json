He\u2019s selling it in large, rectangular plots, but many of the plots overlap, so he\u2019s actually selling the same land multiple times! It\u2019s not real estate, it\u2019s unreal estate!\n\nGiven a description of the possibly overlapping rectangular plots of land that the dishonest landowner has sold, determine the total actual area of land covered by them.\n\n-----Input-----\nThere will be a single test case in the input. Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($0 < n \\le 5000$), indicating the number of plots of land sold. The next $n$ lines will each have a description of a rectangular plot of land, consisting of four real numbers with at most two decimals after the decimal point:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x1 y1 x2 y2\n\nwhere $(x_1,y_1)$ is the southwest corner, and $(x_2,y_2)$ is the northeast corner ($-1000 \\le x_1 < x_2 \\le 1000$, $-1000 \\le y_1 < y_2 \\le 1000$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single real number, which represents the total actual area covered by all of the rectangular plots of land. Output this number with exactly two decimal places, rounded.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n0 0 100 100\n30 30 60 60\nSample Output:\n10000.00\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
