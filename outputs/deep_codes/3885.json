Since the cost to travel between school i and j is $(i + j) \\operatorname{mod}(n + 1)$, the sum of all such costs is the sum of all integers from 1 to n, where each integer i is multiplied by the number of pairs it contributes to (which is n - i + 1). Since the cost to travel between school i and j is independent of the order of i and j, the sum of all such costs is simply the sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n\nHowever, the sum of all integers from 1 to n can be very large, so we only need to take the sum modulo n to avoid overflow", "def min_cost(n):\n    return sum(i for i in range(1, n)) % n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_cost(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe minimum cost is the sum of all possible costs of tickets (from 1 to n-1). The cost of a ticket between schools i and j is (i + j) mod (n + 1). Since we can travel between each pair of schools, the minimum cost is the sum of all possible costs of tickets.\n\nFor example, for n = 10, the possible costs of tickets are:\n(1 + 2) mod 11 = 2,\n(1 + 3) mod 11 = 4,\n(1 + 4) mod 11 = 5,\n...\n(9 + 10) mod 11 = 9,\nand the sum of these costs is 44. However, since we need to minimize the total cost, we only need", "def min_ticket_cost(n):\n    return sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1)) % (n + 1)\n\nprint(min_ticket_cost(int(input())))\n\n\nThis solution works by summing up all the costs of tickets between all pairs of schools and taking the modulus by n + 1. The sum of the costs of tickets between all pairs of schools is the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, which can be computed with the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. The modulus operation is used to ensure that the result is within the range of a single byte, which is sufficient for the problem constraints.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n\ndef min_ticket_cost(n):\n    return sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1)) % (n", "def min_ticket_cost(n):\n    return sum((i + j) % (n + 1) for i in range(1, n + 1) for j in range(i + 1, n + 1))\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_ticket_cost(n))\n\n\nThis solution uses a brute force approach to calculate the minimum cost of tickets needed to visit all schools. It iterates over all pairs of schools (i, j) and calculates the cost of the ticket between them using the formula (i + j) % (n + 1). The sum of these costs is the minimum cost of tickets needed to visit all schools.\n\nThis solution works in O(n^2) time complexity which is feasible for the given constraints (n <= 10^5).\n\nPlease note that the input and output format is assumed based on the problem statement. If the input and output format differs, the code should be adapted accordingly.\n\nNote: This", "n = int(input().strip())\nmin_cost = 0\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    min_cost += (i * (n - i) + n) % (n + 1)\nprint(min_cost % (n + 1))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses the mathematical formula for the sum of arithmetic progression, which is n * (n + 1) / 2. Then we subtract the sum of the cost of each school from the total cost. The result is the minimum cost of tickets needed to visit all schools.\n\nNote:\nThe modulo operation is used to ensure the cost does not exceed the maximum limit.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).\n\nThis solution assumes that the schools are numbered from 1 to n, and that Sajjad starts and finishes in any school.\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA few years ago Sajjad left his school and register to another one due to security reasons. Now he wishes to find Amir, one of his schoolmates and good friends.\n\nThere are n schools numerated from 1 to n. One can travel between each pair of them, to do so, he needs to buy a ticket. The ticker between schools i and j costs $(i + j) \\operatorname{mod}(n + 1)$ and can be used multiple times. Help Sajjad to find the minimum cost he needs to pay for tickets to visit all schools.
