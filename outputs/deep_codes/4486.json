{"4486": {"code": ["s = input()\nresult = ''\nfor i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n    result += s[i]\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis python code reads a string from standard input, then iterates over the string with a step of 2 (i.e., it visits every odd-indexed character), and adds it to the result string. Finally, it prints the result string.\n\nIt's a direct implementation of the problem statement. The step of 2 ensures that only the characters in odd-indexed positions are included in the result. The range function's third argument is the step, and it defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. This is because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because the result string can be as long as the input string.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string is not empty and consists of lowercase English letters only as per the problem constraints.", "s = input()\nprint(''.join([s[i] for i in range(1, len(s), 2)]))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python code reads a string `s` from Standard Input, then it prints a string obtained by concatenating all characters at odd-indexed positions (starting from index 1). The `range` function is used with step 2 to select only odd-indexed characters, and the `join` function is used to concatenate these characters.\n\nThe `range(1, len(s), 2)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 (inclusive), up to `len(s)` (exclusive), and with a step of 2, so it gives all odd-indexed positions. Then, for each `i` in this sequence, it selects the `i`-th character of `s` (0-indexed) and adds it to the resulting string.\n\nThe `''.join(...)` is a string method that concatenates all the characters in the given list (in this case, the list of characters at odd-indexed positions) into a single string.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nTEST CASE:\n\nInput:\natcoder\nOutput:\nacdr\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\nprint(''.join([s[i] for i in range", "s = input()\nprint(''.join([s[i] for i in range(1, len(s), 2)]))\n\n\nThis code reads the input string `s`, and then prints the characters in odd-indexed positions by using a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` with step 2 (which starts from index 1 and skips every second character). The `join` function then concatenates these characters into a new string.\n\nNote: Python uses 0-based indexing, so the second character is at index 1, the fourth character is at index 3, and so on.\n\nThis code is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`.\n\nThis code is correct according to the problem statement and constraints, and it should work for all valid inputs.", "s = input()\nprint(''.join([s[i] for i in range(1, len(s), 2)]))\n\n\nThis code reads the input string, then uses a list comprehension to generate a list of characters at odd-indexed positions (using `range(1, len(s), 2)` to select every second position, starting from the second one). Finally, it joins these characters together into a string with `''.join()` and prints it.\n\nThis code assumes that the input string `s` is at most 10^5 characters long. If the input string `s` is longer, you might need to increase the maximum recursion depth limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)`.\n\nPlease note that the maximum recursion depth limit is system-dependent and may be too low for certain inputs. In such cases, you might need to use a different approach or increase the recursion limit using a different programming language.\n\nFor example, in Python, you can use the `sys.setrecursionlimit()` function to increase the recursion limit:\n\n\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)\n\n\nHowever, be aware that increasing the recursion limit can lead to a crash if the recursion limit is too high, so you should use it judiciously.\n\nAlso", "print(''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0]))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses Python's list comprehension to iterate over every character in the string 's'. The condition `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index 'i' is odd (as indices start at 0, odd indices correspond to odd-numbered positions). If the index is odd, the character at that position is included in the new string. The `join` function is used to concatenate all the characters together into a single string.\n\nThe complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string 's'. This is because we iterate over every character in the string once.\n\nThis solution assumes that the string 's' is given as input in the form of a single string, without any additional formatting. If the string 's' is given as input as a list of characters, you would need to join them into a string first.\n\ns = ''.join(s)\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# solution\ns = input()\nprint(''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0]))\n\n\nThis code reads a string from standard input, then uses a list comprehension to extract characters at odd-indexed"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
