You are to create a Morse-like code that yields the shortest total length to a given message, and return that total length.\n\nA dot symbol has length $1$. A dash symbol has length $3$. The gap between symbols within a character encoding has length $1$. The gap between character encodings has length $3$. Spaces, punctuation, and alphabetic case are ignored, so the text:The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox.\n\nis encoded as though it were justTHEQUICKBROWNDOGJUMPSOVERTHELAZYFOX\n\nFor example, with input ICPC, the answer is $17$: Encode the C\u2019s with a single dot, the I with a dash, and the P with two dots, for an encoding of\u2014 $\\bullet $ $\\bullet \\bullet $ $\\bullet $\n\nwhich has length$(3)+3+(1)+3+(1+1+1)+3+(1) = 17$. \n\n-----Input-----\nThe single line of input contains a string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 32000$) of upper-case or lower-case letters, spaces, commas, periods, exclamation points, and/or question marks. Everything but the letters should be ignored. The line will contain at least one letter.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the length of $s$ when encoded with an optimal reassignment of the sequences of Morse Code.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nICPC\nSample Output 1:\n17\n\nSample Input 2:\nA\nSample Output 2:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
