If the number matches any of these patterns, it divides the number by the corresponding number of digits, effectively \"removing\" those digits from the number. This process is repeated until the number is reduced to zero. If the number is reduced to zero, it means the number is a magic number. If the number is not reduced to zero, it means the number is not a magic number.\n\nThe `is_magic` function takes an integer as input and returns \"YES\" if", "n = input()\nif '14' in n and '114' not in n:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n\n    print('NO')\n\n\nThis code checks if the string '14' is in the input number `n` but not the string '114'. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO'.\n\nThe condition '14' in n checks if the number contains the substring '14'. The condition '114' not in n checks if the number does not contain the substring '114', which would imply that the number contains the substring '14' only once. The substring '114' would only be present if the number is a magic number.\n\nThis way, the code checks if the input number is a magic number.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input number is given as a string to avoid dealing with leading zeros.\n\nThe code works by checking if the input number contains the substring '14' and does not contain the substring '114'. If both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES", "def is_magic(n):\n    while '14' in n or '1144' in n:\n        n = n.replace('14', '', 1).replace('1144', '', 1)\n    return n in ('', '11', '1')\n\nn = input()\nprint('YES' if is_magic(n) else 'NO')\n\nThis code works by repeatedly replacing '14' and '1144' with nothing in the input number. If the resulting number is empty, '11', or '1', then the input number is a magic number, otherwise it is not.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input number does not contain any other digits besides 1 and 4. If this is not the case, the code would need to be modified accordingly.\n\nAlso, the code uses Python's built-in string replace function with a third argument of 1 to replace only the first occurrence of '14' or '1144'. This is necessary to ensure that the code does not loop indefinitely if '14' or '1144' appear", "def is_magic_number(n):\n    if '14' in str(n) or '1144' in str(n):\n        return 'YES'\n    else:\n        return 'NO'\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(is_magic_number(n))\n\n\nThis code works by converting the input number to a string and checking if the string contains '14' or '1144'. If either of these substrings is found, the function returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input number will not contain any leading zeros. If the input number can have leading zeros, then the solution would need to be modified to remove these before checking for the '14' and '1144' substrings.\n\nThis solution is written in Python.

If it is, the function returns \"YES\", indicating that the number is a magic number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns \"NO\", indicating that the number is not a magic number."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA magic number is a number formed by concatenation of numbers 1, 14 and 144.
