Zapray\u2019s Pokemon journey begins with a bag of $100$ Pokeballs. Each time he encounters a Pokemon, he keeps throwing Pokeballs to the Pokemon until he either catches the Pokemon or runs out of Pokeballs. Each Pokeball Zapray throws succeeds in catching the Pokemon with a constant probability $P$. If Zapray finds that he has no Pokeballs when he tries to catch a Pokemon, he gives up on that Pokemon (not catching it) and heads to the Pokeshop to buy a new bag of $100$ Pokeballs for $5$ dollars. Zapray moves on to search for his next Pokemon after he refills the Pokeballs. In particular, if Zapray successfully catches a Pokemon with his last Pokeball, he does not refill his Pokeballs until he encounters the next Pokemon and realizes that he has run out of Pokeballs.\n\nSuppose Zapray encounters $N$ Pokemons in the next few days, what is the expected amount of money he would spend on Pokeballs?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input has an integer $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 10^9$) and a real number $P$ ($0 \\leq P\\leq 1$). $P$ is given with exactly three digits after the decimal point.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the expected amount of money Zapray would spend on Pokeballs. Your answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of no more than $10^{-6}$ from the correct answer.\n\n-----Note-----\nPokemon Go was developed by Niantic, Inc. Niantic does not endorse and has no involvement with the ProgNova contest.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n50 0.125\nSample Output 1:\n16.339203308\n\nSample Input 2:\n201 1.000\nSample Output 2:\n5.000000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
