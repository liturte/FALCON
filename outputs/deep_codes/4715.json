By inserting the three paint can colors into a set, any duplicate colors are automatically removed. The length of the set is then returned as the number of different kinds of colors.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers, and the `split` function is used to split the input string by spaces.\n\nThe `len` function is used to count the number of elements in the set.\n\nThe input and output are handled by the built-in `input` and `print` functions.\n\nThis solution works because sets in Python automatically remove duplicate elements, and the `len` function counts the number of elements in a collection.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), since the number of operations does not change with the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), since the amount of memory used does not change with the size of the input.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be valid and in the correct format", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len({a, b, c}))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code works by taking in three integers a, b, and c from the user, which represent the colors of the paint cans he bought two days ago, yesterday, and today. These are then put into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate values. The length of this set is then printed, which represents the number of different colors of paint cans.\n\nFor example, if a, b, and c were 1, 2, 2 respectively, the set would be {1, 2}, so the length of this set (2) would be printed.\n\nNote: The Python built-in function 'len' is used to get the length of the set, which represents the number of unique elements in the set. The 'map' function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The 'input().split()' function is used to split the input string into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by the 'map' function.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be three integers, as per the problem statement. If this is not the case, error", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len({a, b, c}))\n\n\nThis solution uses the Python set data structure, which automatically removes duplicates and only keeps unique elements. The len() function is used to count the number of elements in the set, which is the number of different colors.\n\nThe input() function is used to read the three colors from the standard input. The split() function is used to split the input into three separate values, which are then converted to integers with the map() function. The result is a set of the three colors, with any duplicates removed. The len() function is then used to count the number of elements in the set, which is the number of different colors.\n\nThis solution assumes that the colors are distinct, as per the problem statement. If the colors can be the same, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(set([a, b, c])))\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the three input values a, b, and c. It then creates a set of these values, which automatically removes any duplicates because sets only allow unique elements. Finally, it prints the number of elements in the set, which is the number of different kinds of colors.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which is the best possible time complexity because it takes a constant amount of time to execute regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the input values and the set.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is valid, i.e., it is three integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. If the input is not valid, the behavior of the program is undefined.\n\nNote: This solution uses Python 3. If you are using a different programming language, the syntax may be different.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\na, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(set([a, b, c])))", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(set([a, b, c])))\n\n\nThe set() function in Python is used to return a set object with distinct items from the input iterable. The len() function is used to count the number of items in the set object.\n\nThis code will output the number of different kinds of colors of the paint cans.\n\"\"\"\n\n#Solution\na, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(set([a, b, c])))\n\n\n\"\"\"\nExplanation:\nThe code takes three inputs from the user, a, b, and c. These are the colors of the paint cans that the deer bought.\n\nThe set() function is used to remove any duplicate colors. For example, if a, b, and c are all the same color, the set function will only return one color.\n\nThe len() function is then used to count the number of colors left in the set. This is the number of different kinds of colors of the paint cans.\n\nThe result is printed to the console.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nTest Case 1:\nInput:"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAtCoDeer the deer recently bought three paint cans.\nThe color of the one he bought two days ago is a, the color of the one he bought yesterday is b, and the color of the one he bought today is c.\nHere, the color of each paint can is represented by an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.\nSince he is forgetful, he might have bought more than one paint can in the same color.\nCount the number of different kinds of colors of these paint cans and tell him.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266a,b,c\u2266100\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b c\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of different kinds of colors of the paint cans.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 1 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThree different colors: 1, 3, and 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
