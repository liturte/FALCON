These calculators generally do not possess very fast processors. In this problem, you are asked to implement a method to speed up the plotting of a polynomial.\n\nGiven a polynomial $p(x) = a_ n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0$ of degree $n$, we wish to plot this polynomial at the $m$ integer points $x = 0, 1, \\ldots , m-1$.

For example, if $p(x) = a_1 x + a_0$ and $p(i)$ has already been computed, then $p(i+1) = p(i) + a_1$.
