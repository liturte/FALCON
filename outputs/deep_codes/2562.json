While the rest of the world is fighting for the Iron Throne, he is going to get ready for the attack of the White Walkers.\n\nHe has created a method to know how strong his army is. Let the i-th soldier\u2019s strength be a_{i}. For some k he calls i_1, i_2, ..., i_{k} a clan if i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < ... < i_{k} and gcd(a_{i}_1, a_{i}_2, ..., a_{i}_{k}) > 1 . He calls the strength of that clan k\u00b7gcd(a_{i}_1, a_{i}_2, ..., a_{i}_{k}). Then he defines the strength of his army by the sum of strengths of all possible clans.\n\nYour task is to find the strength of his army. As the number may be very large, you have to print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\nGreatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of integers is the maximum possible integer so that each element of the sequence is divisible by it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the army.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000000)\u00a0\u2014 denoting the strengths of his soldiers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the strength of John Snow's army modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n3 3 1\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n4\n2 3 4 6\n\nOutput\n39\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the clans are {1}, {2}, {1, 2} so the answer will be 1\u00b73 + 1\u00b73 + 2\u00b73 = 12\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
