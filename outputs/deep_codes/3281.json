Her goal is to use a minimum amount of energy, which she achieves by braking and accelerating as little as possible. This method applies to all wheel-based transport means she owns.\n\nElisabeth has earlier optimized her route by trial and error, but now wants your help to find the optimal path. She has provided a map with $N$ junctions and $R$ straight one-way roads between the junctions.

Her goal is to find a route where the maximum turning angle in the junctions is minimized, as this means maximized speed. However, the route can not be too long.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three space separated integers $J, R, D$ ($2 \\leq J \\leq 200, 1 \\leq R \\leq 40000, 1 \\leq D \\leq 1000000$). $J$ is the number of junctions, $R$ is the number of one-way roads which are connecting two junctions, and $D$ is the maximum distance, in meters, that Elisabeth wants to travel. The road network is such that there is no path, that Elisabeth may want to use, which has the length $L$ such that $D < L < D (1 + 10^{-6})$.\n\nThen follow $J$ lines with two integers $x$ and $y$, ($-100000 \\leq x, y \\leq 100000$), the distinct coordinates in meters on a flat ground.

The turning angle must be output in degrees and have an absolute or relative error at most $10^{-6}$.
