Each of its six sides shows an integer 1 through 6, and two numbers on opposite sides always add up to 7.\nSnuke will first put the die on the table with an arbitrary side facing upward, then repeatedly perform the following operation:\n - Operation: Rotate the die 90\u00b0 toward one of the following directions: left, right, front (the die will come closer) and back (the die will go farther). Then, obtain y points where y is the number written in the side facing upward.\nFor example, let us consider the situation where the side showing 1 faces upward, the near side shows 5 and the right side shows 4, as illustrated in the figure.\nIf the die is rotated toward the right as shown in the figure, the side showing 3 will face upward.\nBesides, the side showing 4 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the left, the side showing 2 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the front, and the side showing 5 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the back.\nFind the minimum number of operation Snuke needs to perform in order to score at least x points in total.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2266 x \u2266 10^{15}\n - x is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nx\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n7\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
