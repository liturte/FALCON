{"4293": {"code": ["P, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P + Q, P + R, Q + R, P + Q + R))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe minimum possible sum of the flight times is the minimum of the sums of the three one-way flight times and the return flight time. This is because the route that minimizes the total flight time is the route that takes the shortest time to reach the first airport and the longest time to reach the third airport.\n\nIn this case, the", "P, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P+Q+min(P+R,Q), P+R+min(Q+R,P), Q+R+min(P+Q,R)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem requires finding the minimum possible sum of the flight times. It is clear that the minimum sum of flight times would be achieved by taking the path which minimizes the sum of the two largest flight times. \n\nIn this case, the path that", "P, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P+Q+min(P+R, Q+R), Q+R+min(P+Q, P+R), R+P+min(Q+P, Q+R)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is straightforward. We calculate the sum of the flight times for each possible route and return the minimum value.\nThe `min(P+R, Q+R)` and `min(Q+P, Q", "P, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P+Q+min(P+R,Q), P+R+min(Q+R,P), Q+R+min(P+Q,R)))\n\n\nThis program reads the input and splits it into P, Q, and R. Then it calculates the minimum possible sum of the flight times by adding the three flight times together and taking the minimum of the three results. It considers all possible routes and chooses the one with the minimum", "P, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P + Q, P + R, Q + R, P + Q + R))\n\n\nThis code reads the input values P, Q, and R, calculates the minimum sum of the flight times for the three routes, and prints the result.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Python code\nP, Q, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(P + Q, P + R, Q + R, P + Q + R"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are three airports A, B and C, and flights between each pair of airports in both directions.\nA one-way flight between airports A and B takes P hours, a one-way flight between airports B and C takes Q hours, and a one-way flight between airports C and A takes R hours.\nConsider a route where we start at one of the airports, fly to another airport and then fly to the other airport.\nWhat is the minimum possible sum of the flight times?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq P,Q,R \\leq 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nP Q R\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum possible sum of the flight times.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1 3 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\n - The sum of the flight times in the route A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C: 1 + 3 = 4 hours\n - The sum of the flight times in the route A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow C: 4 + 3 = 7 hours\n - The sum of the flight times in the route B \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow C: 1 + 4 = 5 hours\n - The sum of the flight times in the route B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A: 3 + 4 = 7 hours\n - The sum of the flight times in the route C \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow B: 4 + 1 = 5 hours\n - The sum of the flight times in the route C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow A: 3 + 1 = 4 hours\nThe minimum of these is 4 hours.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
