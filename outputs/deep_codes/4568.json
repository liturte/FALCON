The size of this intersection is the number of common characters in the two substrings. The maximum of these sizes is the maximum number of different letters contained in both X and Y.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N^2) because it iterates over all possible cut positions and for each position, it computes the intersection of two sets of size N.

It then calculates the symmetric difference between these two sets (i.e., the characters that are in either of the sets, but not in both), and keeps track of the maximum such difference found. This is the maximum number of different characters that can be found in the two substrings.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates over all possible cuts of the string, and for each cut, it calculates the unique characters in the two substrings.

Then it iterates over the string from left to right, updating the count of letters in left and right arrays and at each step, it calculates the number of common letters between the two strings and keeps track of the maximum number.

It then iterates over the string S, moving the cut position from left to right, updating the counts in the left and right Counters, and calculating the number of different letters in the two strings. The maximum number of different letters found during this process is returned as the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O", "import sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nc = Counter(s)\nprint(max(c.values()))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module in Python to count the frequency of each character in the string. It then prints the maximum frequency, which is the maximum number of different letters contained in both X and Y.\n\nThe `Counter` class is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values.\n\nThe `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the dictionary. The `values` method is used to get a list of all values in the dictionary.\n\nThis solution assumes that the string is not empty and that the string contains at least two different characters.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nc = Counter"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.\nWe will cut this string at one position into two strings X and Y.\nHere, we would like to maximize the number of different letters contained in both X and Y.\nFind the largest possible number of different letters contained in both X and Y when we cut the string at the optimal position.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - |S| = N\n - S consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the largest possible number of different letters contained in both X and Y.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\naabbca\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nIf we cut the string between the third and fourth letters into X = aab and Y = bca, the letters contained in both X and Y are a and b.\nThere will never be three or more different letters contained in both X and Y, so the answer is 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
