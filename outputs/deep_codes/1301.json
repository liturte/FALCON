You are not very into pokemons, but quick googling helped you find out, that Eevee can evolve into eight different pokemons: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon.\n\nYou know the length of the word in the crossword, and you already know some letters. Designers of the crossword made sure that the answer is unambiguous, so you can assume that exactly one pokemon out of the 8 that Eevee evolves into fits the length and the letters given. Your task is to find it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains an integer n (6 \u2264 n \u2264 8) \u2013 the length of the string.\n\nNext line contains a string consisting of n characters, each of which is either a lower case english letter (indicating a known letter) or a dot character (indicating an empty cell in the crossword).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a name of the pokemon that Eevee can evolve into that matches the pattern in the input. Use lower case letters only to print the name (in particular, do not capitalize the first letter).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\nj......\n\nOutput\njolteon\n\nInput\n7\n...feon\n\nOutput\nleafeon\n\nInput\n7\n.l.r.o.\n\nOutput\nflareon\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nHere's a set of names in a form you can paste into your solution:\n\n[\"vaporeon\", \"jolteon\", \"flareon\", \"espeon\", \"umbreon\", \"leafeon\", \"glaceon\", \"sylveon\"]\n\n{\"vaporeon\", \"jolteon\", \"flareon\", \"espeon\", \"umbreon\", \"leafeon\", \"glaceon\", \"sylveon\"}\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
