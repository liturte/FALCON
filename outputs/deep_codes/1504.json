In result, $I = \\text{intersection_length}([al_1, ar_1], [bl_1, br_1]) + \\text{intersection_length}([al_2, ar_2], [bl_2, br_2]) + \\\\ + \\text{intersection_length}([al_3, ar_3], [bl_3, br_3]) = 3 + 2 + 0 = 5$\n\nIn the second test case, we can make $[al_1, ar_1] = [0, 1000000000]$ in $1000000000$ steps and $[bl_1, br_1] = [0, 1000000000]$ in $1000000000$ steps.\n\nIn the third test case, the total intersection $I$ is already equal to $10 > 3$, so we don't need to do any steps.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
