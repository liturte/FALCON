Each of these logs is sold for 1 yen (the currency of Japan).\nHe can cut these logs as many times as he wants after buying them. That is, he can get k logs of length L_1, \\dots, L_k from a log of length L, where L = L_1 + \\dots + L_k. He can also throw away unwanted logs.\nSnuke wants to spend as little money as possible to get the logs he wants.\nFind the minimum amount of money needed to get n logs of length 1 to n.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nn\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum amount of money needed to get n logs of length 1 to n.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nOne way to get the logs he wants with 3 yen is:\n - Buy logs of length 2, 4, and 5.\n - Cut the log of length 5 into two logs of length 1 each and a log of length 3.\n - Throw away one of the logs of length 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
