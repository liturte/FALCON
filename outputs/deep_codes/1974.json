After that there will be one robber in the coordinates $(3, 0)$.\n\nThe configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates $(2, 3)$ and $3 > 2$.\n\nIn the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates $(3, 8)$, $(8, 3)$.\n\nIt's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.\n\nIt can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than $3$ moves.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
