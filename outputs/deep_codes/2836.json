The boys are named with distinct even integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots , P_ N$.\n\nBrojko and Brojana are expecting an addition to their family and have to come up with a nice name for the little girl. They have decided that the name will be an odd integer in the range $[A, B]$. Because they find all integers in that range equally beautiful, they have decided to choose the number which maximizes the distance to the name of the closest of the $N$ boys.\n\nMore precisely, they seek an odd integer $X \\in [ A , B ]$ such that the expression\\[ \\min \\{ |X - P_ i| , i \\in [ 1 , N ] \\} \\]\n\nis as large as possible.\n\nWrite a program that determines the name for the little girl.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ ($1\\le N \\le 100$), the number of boys.\n\nThe second line contains N distinct positive even integers, the names of the boys. The integers will be less than $10^9$.\n\nThe third line contains the integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\le A < B \\le 10^9$), the range of names they are considering for the girl.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput an integer, the name for the little girl. If there are multiple solutions, any one of them will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2 6 16\n20 50\nSample Output 1:\n49\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n2 6 16\n3 15\nSample Output 2:\n11\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
