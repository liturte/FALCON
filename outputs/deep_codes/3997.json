In each vertex Alyona wrote an positive integer, in the vertex i she wrote a_{i}. Moreover, the girl wrote a positive integer to every edge of the tree (possibly, different integers on different edges).\n\nLet's define dist(v, u) as the sum of the integers written on the edges of the simple path from v to u.\n\nThe vertex v controls the vertex u (v \u2260 u) if and only if u is in the subtree of v and dist(v, u) \u2264 a_{u}.\n\nAlyona wants to settle in some vertex. In order to do this, she wants to know for each vertex v what is the number of vertices u such that v controls u.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the integers written in the vertices.\n\nThe next (n - 1) lines contain two integers each. The i-th of these lines contains integers p_{i} and w_{i} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the parent of the (i + 1)-th vertex in the tree and the number written on the edge between p_{i} and (i + 1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n integers\u00a0\u2014 the i-th of these numbers should be equal to the number of vertices that the i-th vertex controls.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 5 1 4 6\n1 7\n1 1\n3 5\n3 6\n\nOutput\n1 0 1 0 0\n\nInput\n5\n9 7 8 6 5\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n\nOutput\n4 3 2 1 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the example test case the vertex 1 controls the vertex 3, the vertex 3 controls the vertex 5 (note that is doesn't mean the vertex 1 controls the vertex 5).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
