There are K digits that she dislikes: D_1, D_2, ..., D_K.\nShe is shopping, and now paying at the cashier.\nHer total is N yen (the currency of Japan), thus she has to hand at least N yen to the cashier (and possibly receive the change).\nHowever, as mentioned before, she is very particular about numbers. When she hands money to the cashier, the decimal notation of the amount must not contain any digits that she dislikes. Under this condition, she will hand the minimum amount of money.\nFind the amount of money that she will hand to the cashier.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n -  1 \u2266 N < 10000\n -  1 \u2266 K < 10\n -  0 \u2266 D_1 < D_2 < \u2026 < D_K\u22669\n - \\{D_1,D_2,...,D_K\\} \u2260 \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\nD_1 D_2 \u2026 D_K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the amount of money that Iroha will hand to the cashier.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1000 8\n1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2000\n\nShe dislikes all digits except 0 and 2.\nThe smallest integer equal to or greater than N=1000 whose decimal notation contains only 0 and 2, is 2000.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
