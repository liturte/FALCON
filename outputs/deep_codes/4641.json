After the second query, the array is $a=[0, 1]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $2$.  After the third query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$.  After the fourth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2]$: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is $3$ (you can't make it greater with operations).  After the fifth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the sixth query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0]$: you can perform $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$. The array changes to be $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $4$.  After the seventh query, the array is $a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10]$. You can perform the following operations:   $a[3] := a[3] + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$,  $a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$,  $a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$,  $a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4$.  The resulting array will be $a=[0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4]$. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to $7$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
