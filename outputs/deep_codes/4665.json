Columns can be in any order. IDs, marks, class and name can be written in any order in the spreadsheet.\n2. Column names are ID, MARKS, CLASS and NAME. (The spelling and case type of these names won't change.)\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.\nThe second line contains the names of the columns in any order.\nThe next N lines contains the marks, IDs, name and class, under their respective column names.\n\n=====Constraints=====\n0<N\u2264100\n\n=====Output Format=====\nPrint the average marks of the list corrected to 2 decimal places.\nSTARTER CODE:\n# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
