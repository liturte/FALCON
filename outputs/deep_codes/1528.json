A level-L burger (L is an integer greater than or equal to 0) is the following thing:\n - A level-0 burger is a patty.\n - A level-L burger (L \\geq 1) is a bun, a level-(L-1) burger, a patty, another level-(L-1) burger and another bun, stacked vertically in this order from the bottom.\nFor example, a level-1 burger and a level-2 burger look like BPPPB and BBPPPBPBPPPBB (rotated 90 degrees), where B and P stands for a bun and a patty.\nThe burger Mr. Takaha will make is a level-N burger. Lunlun the Dachshund will eat X layers from the bottom of this burger (a layer is a patty or a bun). How many patties will she eat?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 50\n - 1 \\leq X \\leq ( the total number of layers in a level-N burger )\n - N and X are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of patties in the bottom-most X layers from the bottom of a level-N burger.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 7\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\nThere are 4 patties in the bottom-most 7 layers of a level-2 burger (BBPPPBPBPPPBB).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
