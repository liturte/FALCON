Each tower consists of several cubes standing on each other. The $i$-th tower consists of $h_i$ cubes, so it has height $h_i$.\n\nLet's define operation slice on some height $H$ as following: for each tower $i$, if its height is greater than $H$, then remove some top cubes to make tower's height equal to $H$. Cost of one \"slice\" equals to the total number of removed cubes from all towers.\n\nLet's name slice as good one if its cost is lower or equal to $k$ ($k \\ge n$).\n\n [Image] \n\nCalculate the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same height. Of course, it is always possible to make it so.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n \\le k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of towers and the restriction on slices, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ space separated integers $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the initial heights of towers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same heigth.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n3 1 2 2 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 5\n2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it's optimal to make $2$ slices. The first slice is on height $2$ (its cost is $3$), and the second one is on height $1$ (its cost is $4$).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
