Then, it calculates the sum of these cards. The 0s and -1s are multiplied by 0 and -1 respectively to give the correct values, and the maximum sum is achieved by picking up as many 1s as possible and as few 0s and -1s as possible.\n\nNote that the use of `min(A, K)` is to ensure that we don't pick more cards than available. Similarly, `max(0, K-A)` and `max(0, K-A-B)` are used to ensure that we don't pick more 0s and -1s than available.\n\nThis solution assumes that the order in which the cards are picked doesn't matter. If the", "A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(A, K) + min(B, max(0, K-A)) * 0 + min(C, max(0, K-A-B)) * -1)\n\n\nThis solution works by first picking up the minimum number of 1s cards that we can, then we check if there are any 0s cards left to pick and if so, we pick up as many as we can. Then we check for -1s cards and if there are any left, we pick up as many as we can. We multiply the -1s by -1 to convert them to 1s in the sum.\n\nThe `min(A, K)` part picks up the minimum number of 1s cards that we can.\n\nThe `min(B, max(0, K-A))` part picks up the minimum number of 0s cards that we can, but only if there are enough cards left to pick up. If there are not, it picks up as many 0s cards as there are left.\n\nThe `min(C, max(0, K-A-B", "A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(A, K) + min(B, max(K-A, 0)) * 0 + min(C, max(K-A-B, 0)) * -1)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is about maximizing the sum of the integers written on the cards. The integers are either 1, 0, or -1. We have A cards with 1, B cards with 0, and C cards with -1. We need to pick K cards.\n\nWe can solve this problem by using the min() function to choose the right number of cards from each category. The min() function is used to ensure that we do not exceed the total number of cards we have. The max() function is used to ensure that we do not choose more cards than we have.\n\nFor the 1s, we choose the minimum number of cards (A) that we can. For the 0s, we choose the minimum number of cards (B) that we can, but we need to ensure that we do not choose more cards than we have. For the -1s, we do the same", "A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(A, K) + (max(0, K - A - B) * -1))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe maximum possible sum is achieved when we take as many cards with 1s as possible (up to K of them), and take as many cards with 0s as possible (up to K of them). We need to take at least as many cards with -1s as possible to minimize the sum. Therefore, we take the minimum of A and K cards with 1s, and the maximum of 0 and K - A - B cards with -1s. The sum of these two values is the maximum possible sum.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the number of cards with 1s (A), 0s (B), and -1s (C) are integers, and that K is a positive integer.\n\nThis solution is based on the observation that the maximum possible sum is achieved when we take as many cards with 1s as possible, and take as many cards with -1s as possible to minimize the sum. We take the minimum of A and K cards with 1s,", "A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())\n\nif A + B >= K:\n    print(K)\nelse:\n    print(A + min((K - A - B), B) * 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe first part of the condition checks if we have enough cards with 1s to cover K. If so, we can just return K.\n\nThe second part of the condition checks if we have enough cards with 0s to make up the difference between K and the number of 1s and 0s we have. If so, we can just return the sum of A and the number of cards with 0s.\n\nThe minimum of K - A - B and B is used to ensure that we are not using more cards with 0s than we have.\n\nThe multiplication by 2 is used to convert the number of cards with 0s to their corresponding values.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that we can always get the maximum possible sum by picking up the most positive cards first, and then picking up the most negative cards if necessary.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it performs"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have A cards, each of which has an integer 1 written on it.
