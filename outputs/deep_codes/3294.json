Since the pocket of oil is quite deep already, and new drill bits are expensive, Crossland\u2019s oil company would like to minimise the distance drilled\u2014which may not be vertical\u2014to get to the valuable spot.\n\nThe elevation-contoured survey map we have obtained marks the oil pocket at $(0,0)$, $0$ metres above sea level.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing one positive integer $N$, the number of polygon-shaped contour lines.\n - $N$ more lines each containing two integers, $H_0$ and $H_1$ ($0 \\le H_0, H_1 \\le 10^6$), the height of land in metres above sea level outside and inside the contour respectively, followed by a positive integer $M_ i$ representing the number of vertices of this contour.\n - The remaining $2 \\cdot M_ i$ integers on each line are distinct coordinate pairs ($x_ j, y_ j$) ($-10^6 \\le x,y \\le 10^6$) denoting the $j^{th}$ point on the contour. No two contour lines touch, nor does a contour line touch the point $(0,0)$.\n\nThe total number of points across all contours will not exceed $10^5$, and it is guaranteed that the outer height of a contour is always equal to the inner height of its containing contour, if one exists.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain one real number indicating the closest slanted distance from the surface to the target. Your answer should be correct up to an absolute or relative precision of $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n5 8 4 -2 0 0 -3 2 0 0 3\n8 10 4 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 1\nSample Output 1:\n5.2696518641\n\nSample Input 2:\n1\n8 9 3 -14 -14 14 -14 0 20\nSample Output 2:\n9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
