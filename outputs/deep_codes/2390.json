If he leaves now, the total nutrition taken in is 200 kilocalories, and the total energy consumed is 9 kilocalories, thus he can take in 191 kilocalories on balance, which is the largest possible value.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
