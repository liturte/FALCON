Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), such that the following conditions hold:  there is integer j (l \u2264 j \u2264 r), such that all integers a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r} are divisible by a_{j};  value r - l takes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition 1 is true; \n\nHelp Simon, find the required pair of numbers (l, r). If there are multiple required pairs find all of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5).\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers in the first line \u2014 the number of required pairs and the maximum value of r - l. On the following line print all l values from optimal pairs in increasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 6 9 3 6\n\nOutput\n1 3\n2 \n\nInput\n5\n1 3 5 7 9\n\nOutput\n1 4\n1 \n\nInput\n5\n2 3 5 7 11\n\nOutput\n5 0\n1 2 3 4 5 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the pair of numbers is right, as numbers 6, 9, 3 are divisible by 3.\n\nIn the second sample all numbers are divisible by number 1.\n\nIn the third sample all numbers are prime, so conditions 1 and 2 are true only for pairs of numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
