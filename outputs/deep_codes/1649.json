This means that the sum of the deliciousness of the remaining cookies is equal to the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies. \n\nThe sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies is the total sum of the deliciousness of all cookies minus the maximum deliciousness of the cookies. The sum of the deliciousness of the remaining cookies is the maximum deliciousness of the cookies. \n\nSo, the problem is asking if the maximum deliciousness of the cookies is less than or equal to the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies. \n\nThis can be solved with a simple if statement in Python. The if statement checks if the maximum deliciousness of the cookies is less than or equal to the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. If not, it prints 'No'.", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B + C + D - max(A, B, C, D) <= max(A, B, C, D) else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the input values A, B, C, and D. It then calculates the sum of the deliciousness of the remaining cookies by subtracting the maximum deliciousness from the total sum of the deliciousness. If this value is less than or equal to the maximum deliciousness, it means it's possible that the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies is equal to that of the remaining cookies. The solution then prints 'Yes' if this condition is true, and 'No' otherwise.", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B + C + D - max(A, B, C, D) <= max(A, B, C, D) else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by first taking in the four input values and summing them up. Then, it subtracts the maximum value from this sum (which is the value of the cookie Snuke would eat if he wanted to make the sums equal). If this result is less than or equal to the maximum value, it means it is possible for the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies to be equal to that of the remaining cookies, and the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B + C + D - max(A, B, C, D) <= max(A, B, C, D) else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading in the four cookies' deliciousness values. It then calculates the sum of the deliciousness of the remaining cookies by subtracting the largest of the four values from the total sum. If this sum is less than or equal to the largest value, it means it's possible for the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies to be equal to that of the remaining cookies, so it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe `max` function is used to find the largest of the four values, and the `map` and `input().split()` functions are used to read in the values and convert them to integers.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the values of the cookies are distinct. If there are two or more cookies with the same deliciousness value, the solution may not work correctly.", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A+B+C+D-max(A,B,C,D) <= max(A,B,C,D) else 'No')\n\n\nThis code works by first taking in the four input values, A, B, C, and D. It then calculates the sum of the deliciousness of all the cookies minus the maximum deliciousness and checks if this sum is less than or equal to the maximum deliciousness. If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.\n\nThe reason for this solution is that the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies can be equal to the sum of the deliciousness of the remaining cookies if and only if the maximum deliciousness of the remaining cookies is less than or equal to the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies minus the maximum deliciousness of the eaten cookies.\n\nThis solution works because the maximum deliciousness of the remaining cookies must be less than or equal to the maximum deliciousness of the eaten cookies, because the eaten cookies can't have a higher deliciousness than the remaining cookies. Therefore, the sum of the deliciousness of the eaten cookies minus the maximum deliciousness of the eaten cookies must"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke has four cookies with deliciousness A, B, C, and D.
