Each integer appears exactly once in the sequence.\n\nA subsequence of $A$ is a sequence obtained by removing some (possibly none) numbers from the beginning of $A$, and then from the end of $A$.\n\nCalculate how many different subsequences of $A$ of odd length have their median equal to $B$. The median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For example, the median of the sequence $(5, 1, 3)$ is $3$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers, $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100000$) and $B$ ($1 \\le B \\le N$).\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers separated by spaces, the elements of sequence $A$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of subsequences of $A$ whose median is $B$.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Input-----\nIn Sample Input 3, the four subsequences of $A$ with median $4$ are $(4)$, $(7, 2, 4)$, $(5, 7, 2, 4, 3)$ and $(5, 7, 2, 4, 3, 1, 6)$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 4\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 3\n1 2 4 5 6 3\nSample Output 2:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
