We can define logical OR of three or more logical values in the same manner:\n\n$a_{1} OR a_{2} OR \\ldots OR a_{k}$ where $a_{i} \\in \\{0,1 \\}$ is equal to 1 if some a_{i} = 1, otherwise it is equal to 0.\n\nNam has a matrix A consisting of m rows and n columns. The rows are numbered from 1 to m, columns are numbered from 1 to n. Element at row i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) and column j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) is denoted as A_{ij}. All elements of A are either 0 or 1. From matrix A, Nam creates another matrix B of the same size using formula:\n\n[Image].\n\n(B_{ij} is OR of all elements in row i and column j of matrix A)\n\nNam gives you matrix B and challenges you to guess matrix A. Although Nam is smart, he could probably make a mistake while calculating matrix B, since size of A can be large.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer m and n (1 \u2264 m, n \u2264 100), number of rows and number of columns of matrices respectively.\n\nThe next m lines each contain n integers separated by spaces describing rows of matrix B (each element of B is either 0 or 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print \"NO\" if Nam has made a mistake when calculating B, otherwise print \"YES\". If the first line is \"YES\", then also print m rows consisting of n integers representing matrix A that can produce given matrix B. If there are several solutions print any one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\n1 0\n0 0\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n2 3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nInput\n2 3\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
