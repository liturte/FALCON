Her team has already solved $k$ out of the $n$ problems in the problem set, but as the problems become harder, she begins to lose focus and her mind starts to wander. \n\nShe recalls hearing the judges talk about the difficulty of the problems, which they rate on an integer scale from $0$ to $100$, inclusive. In fact, one of the judges said that \u201cthe problem set has never been so tough, the average difficulty of the problems in the problem set is $d$!\u201d\n\nShe starts thinking about the problems her team has solved so far, and comes up with an estimate $s$ for their average difficulty. In hope of gaining some motivation, Lotte wonders if she can use this information to determine the average difficulty of the remaining problems.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2\\leq n\\leq 10^6$, $0 < k < n$), the total number of problems and the number of problems Lotte\u2019s team has solved so far.\n - One line with two integers $d$ and $s$ ($0\\leq d,s \\leq 100$), the average difficulty of all the problems and Lotte\u2019s estimate of the average difficulty of the problems her team has solved.\n\n-----Output-----\nAssuming Lotte\u2019s estimate is correct, output the average difficulty of the unsolved problems, or \u201cimpossible\u201d if the average difficulty does not exist. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 1\n70 50\nSample Output 1:\n90.00\n\nSample Input 2:\n10 3\n80 90\nSample Output 2:\n75.7142857\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
