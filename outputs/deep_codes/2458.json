Now it's Marmot's dinner time and, as we all know, Marmot eats flowers. At every dinner he eats some red and white flowers. Therefore a dinner can be represented as a sequence of several flowers, some of them white and some of them red.\n\nBut, for a dinner to be tasty, there is a rule: Marmot wants to eat white flowers only in groups of size k.\n\nNow Marmot wonders in how many ways he can eat between a and b flowers. As the number of ways could be very large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput contains several test cases.\n\nThe first line contains two integers t and k (1 \u2264 t, k \u2264 10^5), where t represents the number of test cases.\n\nThe next t lines contain two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10^5), describing the i-th test.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint t lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain the number of ways in which Marmot can eat between a_{i} and b_{i} flowers at dinner modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n6\n5\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----  For K = 2 and length 1 Marmot can eat (R).  For K = 2 and length 2 Marmot can eat (RR) and (WW).  For K = 2 and length 3 Marmot can eat (RRR), (RWW) and (WWR).  For K = 2 and length 4 Marmot can eat, for example, (WWWW) or (RWWR), but for example he can't eat (WWWR).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
