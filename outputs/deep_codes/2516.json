He wants to know how many non-empty (contiguous) substrings of S - there are N \\times (N + 1) / 2 of them - are divisible by P when regarded as integers written in base ten.\nHere substrings starting with a 0 also count, and substrings originated from different positions in S are distinguished, even if they are equal as strings or integers.\nCompute this count to help Takahashi.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - S consists of digits.\n - |S| = N\n - 2 \\leq P \\leq 10000\n - P is a prime number.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN P\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings of S that are divisible by P when regarded as an integer written in base ten.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 3\n3543\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n6\n\nHere S = 3543. There are ten non-empty (contiguous) substrings of S:\n - 3: divisible by 3.\n - 35: not divisible by 3.\n - 354: divisible by 3.\n - 3543: divisible by 3.\n - 5: not divisible by 3.\n - 54: divisible by 3.\n - 543: divisible by 3.\n - 4: not divisible by 3.\n - 43: not divisible by 3.\n - 3: divisible by 3.\nSix of these are divisible by 3, so print 6.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
