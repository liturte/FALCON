She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $H$ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $L$ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface. [Image] \n\nSuppose that the lily grows at some point $A$ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $A$. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $A$, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $A$?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers $H$ and $L$ ($1 \\le H < L \\le 10^{6}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number\u00a0\u2014 the depth of the lake at point $A$. The absolute or relative error should not exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\nFormally, let your answer be $A$, and the jury's answer be $B$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\\frac{|A - B|}{\\max{(1, |B|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2\n\nOutput\n1.5000000000000\n\nInput\n3 5\n\nOutput\n2.6666666666667\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
