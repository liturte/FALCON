What is more, he knows that string t has a form \"abab...\", namely there are letters 'a' on odd positions and letters 'b' on even positions.\n\nSuddenly in the morning, Vasya found that somebody spoiled his string. Some letters of the string s were replaced by character '?'.\n\nLet's call a sequence of positions i, i + 1, ..., i + m - 1 as occurrence of string t in s, if 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - m + 1 and t_1 = s_{i}, t_2 = s_{i} + 1, ..., t_{m} = s_{i} + m - 1.\n\nThe boy defines the beauty of the string s as maximum number of disjoint occurrences of string t in s. Vasya can replace some letters '?' with 'a' or 'b' (letters on different positions can be replaced with different letter). Vasya wants to make some replacements in such a way that beauty of string s is maximum possible. From all such options, he wants to choose one with the minimum number of replacements. Find the number of replacements he should make.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of s.\n\nThe second line contains the string s of length n. It contains small English letters 'a', 'b' and characters '?' only.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of t. The string t contains letters 'a' on odd positions and 'b' on even positions.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of replacements Vasya has to perform to make the beauty of string s the maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\nbb?a?\n1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n9\nab??ab???\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample string t has a form 'a'. The only optimal option is to replace all characters '?' by 'a'.\n\nIn the second sample using two replacements we can make string equal to \"aba?aba??\". It is impossible to get more than two occurrences.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
