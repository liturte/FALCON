Here is the last problem of the exam.\n\nYou are given three points a, b, c.\n\nFind a point and an angle such that if we rotate the page around the point by the angle, the new position of a is the same as the old position of b, and the new position of b is the same as the old position of c.\n\nArpa is doubting if the problem has a solution or not (i.e. if there exists a point and an angle satisfying the condition). Help Arpa determine if the question has a solution or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains six integers a_{x}, a_{y}, b_{x}, b_{y}, c_{x}, c_{y} (|a_{x}|, |a_{y}|, |b_{x}|, |b_{y}|, |c_{x}|, |c_{y}| \u2264 10^9). It's guaranteed that the points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" if the problem has a solution, \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 1 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n1 1 0 0 1000 1000\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test, rotate the page around (0.5, 0.5) by $90^{\\circ}$.\n\nIn the second sample test, you can't find any solution.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
