Today some villains have set on fire first $n - 1$ of them, and now the only safety building is $n$-th skyscraper.\n\nLet's call a jump from $i$-th skyscraper to $j$-th ($i < j$) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if $i < j$ and one of the following conditions satisfied:   $i + 1 = j$  $\\max(h_{i + 1}, \\ldots, h_{j - 1}) < \\min(h_i, h_j)$  $\\max(h_i, h_j) < \\min(h_{i + 1}, \\ldots, h_{j - 1})$. \n\nAt the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach $n$-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 total amount of skyscrapers.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 heights of skyscrapers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single number $k$ \u2014 minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 3 1 4 5\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n4\n4 2 2 4\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n2\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n5\n100 1 100 1 100\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5$.\n\nIn the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.\n\nSequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
