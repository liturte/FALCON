This is a simple game using the different colors of the floor tiles as markers for where it is safe to walk and where it is not. The rules of the game say that you\u2019re allowed to walk on white tiles, but not on black tiles. The tiles are square.\n\nElsa typically plays this game together with her father. As he is an adult and (sometimes) can move over tiles that Elsa cannot, Elsa has decided that she is allowed to move in all directions while her father is only allowed to move along the $2$ axes of the floor tiles, and they are only allowed to take steps up to a certain length. This means in particular that Elsa can move to any tile within the radius of her step length (measured in the usual Euclidean distance).\n\nThe goal of this game is to get from store $A$ to store $B$ as quickly as possible. Both players move at the same time and they are not allowed to do the next move until they are both finished with the first move. As both the father and Elsa hate to lose, the best outcome is to end up with them getting to the finish at the same time.
