As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below.  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p.  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p. \n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.
