{"1231": {"code": ["a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"YES\" if a <= b + 1 else \"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by simple comparison. If the number of even steps is less than or equal to the number of odd steps plus one, then there is an interval that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, there is no such interval. The condition is a <= b + 1 because for each odd step, there must be at least one even step between them. So the number of odd steps should not exceed the number of even steps by more than one.\n\nThe input and output part is already described in the problem statement. The map function is used to convert the input string to integers. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThis solution is written in Python.\n\nThis problem", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"YES\" if a <= b * 2 else \"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is pretty straightforward. We need to check if the number of even steps (a) is less than or equal to the double the number of odd steps (b). If it is, we print \"YES\" as there exists an interval of steps where the number of even and odd steps are balanced. Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThe map function is used to convert the input string to integers. The split function is used to separate the input string into its constituent parts. The condition is then checked using the ternary operator.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), meaning it runs in constant time, regardless of the input size. This", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"YES\" if a <= b * 2 else \"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe condition for the interval to be valid is that the number of even steps should be less than or equal to twice the number of odd steps. This is because in an even-numbered staircase, Dasha will encounter an equal number of even steps as odd steps, while in an odd-numbered staircase, she will encounter one more even step.\n\nThis condition is checked with the line `print(\"YES\" if a <= b * 2 else \"NO\")`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b * 2`, `\"YES\"` is printed; otherwise, `\"NO\"` is printed.\n\nThe", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nif a >= b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem is a simple comparison problem. We just need to check if the number of even steps is greater or equal to the number of odd steps. If it is, we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThe solution is written in Python language. The `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input string into a list of strings. The `if` statement is used to compare the two numbers.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nif a >= b:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads two integers a and b from the input. Then it checks if a is greater or equal to b. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is because the number of even steps must be greater or equal to the number of odd steps for there to be an interval of steps where both values are correct.\n\nThis is a simple problem that can be solved with a single if-else statement. The only tricky part is understanding the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement is somewhat confusing because it talks about \"even and odd steps\", but then asks for a range of steps from l to r.

As we know, tigers are very fond of all striped things, it is possible that it has something to do with their color. So on some interval of her way she calculated two values \u2014 the number of steps with even and odd numbers. \n\nYou need to check whether there is an interval of steps from the l-th to the r-th (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r), for which values that Dasha has found are correct.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn the only line you are given two integers a, b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of even and odd steps, accordingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print \"YES\", if the interval of steps described above exists, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example one of suitable intervals is from 1 to 5.
