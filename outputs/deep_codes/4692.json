However, we need to consider the case where we are past New Year. If we are past New Year (i.e., the current hour is greater than New Year's hour), we need to subtract 24 hours to get the correct count. The modulus operator (%) is used to handle this case, as it will return the remainder of the division operation, which will be the number of hours until New Year.\n\nThis code works for any valid input M (1\u2264M\u226423), and it calculates the number of hours until New Year at M o'clock on 30th, December.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test cases\nassert code_to_test(\"21\") == \"27\"\nassert code_to_test(\"12\") == \"12\"\nassert code_to_test(\"0\") == \"24\"\nassert code_to_test(\"18\") == \"10\"\nassert code_to_test(\"23\") == \"1\"\n\nprint(\"All test cases pass\")\n\n\nThis code will test the code_to_test function with a variety of inputs and assert that the output is as expected.

The calculation is done using the formula (24 - M) % 24, which calculates the remainder of the division of 24 by the number of hours until New Year at M o'clock.\n\nThe modulo operator % is used to ensure that the result is in the range 0 to 23, which corresponds to the 24-hour", "M = int(input())\nhours_until_new_year = 24 - M + 1\nprint(hours_until_new_year)\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer M from standard input, which represents the hour at which we want to know how many hours until New Year. It then calculates the number of hours until New Year by subtracting M from 24 (the total number of hours in a day), adding 1 (because we want to include the hour at M), and printing the result."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nHow many hours do we have until New Year at M o'clock (24-hour notation) on 30th, December?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2264M\u226423\n - M is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nM\n\n-----Output-----\nIf we have x hours until New Year at M o'clock on 30th, December, print x.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n21\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n27\n\nWe have 27 hours until New Year at 21 o'clock on 30th, December.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
