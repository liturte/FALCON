In this case, r is 1/24, so the number of transistors doubles every 24 seconds.

The number of transistors starts at 'n' and increases by 2 to the power of how many 24-second intervals have passed since the initial time 't'. The result is printed to", "import sys\n\ndef solve(n, t):\n    return round(n * (2.0 ** (t / 24.0)))\n\nn, t = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nprint(solve(n, t))\n\n\nThis python code uses the formula for exponential growth to calculate the number of transistors in the given time. The formula is n * (2.0 ** (t / 24.0)), where n is the initial number of transistors and t is the time in seconds. The result is then rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nThe time complexity", "import math\n\nn, t = map(int, input().split())\nprint(n * math.pow(2.000000011, t))\n\n\nThis solution uses the exponential growth model of Moore's law, which is implemented using Python's built-in `math.pow()` function. The growth factor 2.000000011 is slightly more than 2 to account for the increase in transistors every second (as stated in the problem).\n\nThe `math.pow()` function raises the base number to the power of the second argument, which in this", "import sys\n\ndef solve(n, t):\n    return n * (2.0 ** (t / 24.0))\n\nn, t = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nprint(solve(n, t))\n\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the number of transistors in t seconds using the formula given in the problem statement, and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that the relative error of the answer should not be greater than 10^{-6}, which is the precision of the floating point numbers in Python.

The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.\n\nYou are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly 1.000000011 times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains a pair of integers n (1000 \u2264 n \u2264 10\u00a0000) and t (0 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed since the initial time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one number \u2014 the estimate of the number of transistors in a dence integrated circuit in t seconds since the initial time.
