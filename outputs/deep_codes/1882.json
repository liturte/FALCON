In this case you'll spend 80 + 100 + 90 = 270 milliseconds, falling within the length of the exam, 300 milliseconds (and even leaving yourself 30 milliseconds to have a rest). Problems 3 and 1 will bring you a point each, while problem 4 won't. You'll score two points.\n\nIn the second example, the length of the exam is catastrophically not enough to solve even a single problem.\n\nIn the third example, you have just enough time to solve both problems in 42 + 58 = 100 milliseconds and hand your solutions to the teacher with a smile.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
