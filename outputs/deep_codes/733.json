You can consider the wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. \n\nIahub has the following scheme of painting: he skips x - 1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the x-th one. That is, he'll paint bricks x, 2\u00b7x, 3\u00b7x and so on red. Similarly, Floyd skips y - 1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the y-th one. Hence he'll paint bricks y, 2\u00b7y, 3\u00b7y and so on pink.\n\nAfter painting the wall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink. Iahub has a lucky number a and Floyd has a lucky number b. Boys wonder how many bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b are painted both red and pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print the answer to the question. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input will have a single line containing four integers in this order: x, y, a, b. (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 2\u00b710^9, a \u2264 b).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b that are painted both red and pink.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3 6 18\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's look at the bricks from a to b (a = 6, b = 18). The bricks colored in red are numbered 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. The bricks colored in pink are numbered 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The bricks colored in both red and pink are numbered with 6, 12 and 18.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
