For each element, if it's not at the correct position (i.e., it's not equal to its index), it finds its position in the permutation using the index() method, swaps it with the element before it, and increments the number of swaps. The process continues until all elements are at their correct positions. The final number of swaps is then printed.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# Test case:\n# print(swap_operations(5, [1", "def solve():\n    N = int(input())\n    p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(N):\n        while p[i] != i+1:\n            p[i], p[p[i]-1] = p[p[i]-1], p[i]\n            ans += 1\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking us to find the minimum number of swaps required to transform the given permutation into a permutation where each element is not equal to its position. We can solve this by iterating over the elements in the permutation and swapping them to their correct position until they are. The number of swaps needed is the answer.\n\nIn the given sample input, the first element 1 is already at its correct position, so no swap is needed. For the second element 4, we need to swap it", "def min_swaps():\n    n = int(input())\n    p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    swaps = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if visited[i] or p[i] == i + 1:\n            continue\n\n        cycle_size = 0\n        j = i\n        while not visited[j]:\n            visited[j] = True\n            j = p[j] - 1\n            cycle_size += 1\n\n        if cycle_size > 0:\n            swaps += cycle_size - 1\n\n    return swaps\n\nprint(min_swaps())\n\nThe solution is based on the concept of disjoint set union. The idea is to traverse the array and for each element, if it's not visited and it's not at the correct position, we start a cycle by marking all elements in the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a permutation p_1,p_2,...,p_N consisting of 1,2,..,N.\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\nOperation: Swap two adjacent elements in the permutation.\nYou want to have p_i \u2260 i for all 1\u2264i\u2264N.\nFind the minimum required number of operations to achieve this.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2\u2264N\u226410^5\n - p_1,p_2,..,p_N is a permutation of 1,2,..,N.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\np_1 p_2 .. p_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum required number of operations\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5\n1 4 3 5 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nSwap 1 and 4, then swap 1 and 3. p is now 4,3,1,5,2 and satisfies the condition.\nThis is the minimum possible number, so the answer is 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
