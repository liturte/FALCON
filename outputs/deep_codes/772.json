This can be done by summing the number of times each light is pressed and checking if the light is in the middle of the grid. If it is, we add 1 to the sum. The state of each light is then the result of the sum modulo 2. This is because a light is toggled on if and", "for i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        print((sum([int(input()) for _ in range(3)])+int(input()))%2, end=\"\")\n    print()\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code loops through each light in the 3x3 grid. For each light, it reads the number of times it's been pressed from the input. It sums these presses for the light and the row and column it's in, then adds the presses for the light itself. The result is the total number of presses for the light. If this number is odd, the light ends up in an \"on\" state", "for i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        print((sum([int(input()) for _ in range(3)])+int(input()))%2, end='')\n    print()\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program uses nested loops to iterate through each light on the grid. For each light, it reads the number of times it has been pressed from the input. It then calculates the sum of these presses and checks if this sum is even or odd. If the sum is odd, the light is toggled on (i.e., it's switched from off to on), so the program prints \"1\".

Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and all side-adjacent lights. The goal of the game is to switch all the lights off. We consider the toggling as follows: if the light was switched on then it will be switched off, if it was switched off then it will be switched on.\n\nLenny has spent some time playing with the grid and by now he has pressed each light a certain number of times. Given the number of times each light is pressed, you have to print the current state of each light.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of three rows. Each row contains three integers each between 0 to 100 inclusive. The j-th number in the i-th row is the number of times the j-th light of the i-th row of the grid is pressed.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint three lines, each containing three characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is \"1\" if and only if the corresponding light is switched on, otherwise it's \"0\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n\nOutput\n001\n010\n100\n\nInput\n1 0 1\n8 8 8\n2 0 3\n\nOutput\n010\n011\n100\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
