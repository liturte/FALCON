It starts with `a=2` and `b=1` which are the first two Lucas numbers. Then it iteratively updates `a` and `b` to be `b` and `a+b` respectively, which corresponds to the recurrence relation for Lucas numbers. Finally, it returns `a` which is the n-th Lucas number. The input is read from standard input and passed to the `lucas` function, which is then printed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:", "def lucas(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 2, 1\n        for _ in range(n - 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(lucas(n))\n\nThis code defines a function `lucas(n)` that calculates the n-th Lucas number.
