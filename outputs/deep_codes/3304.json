The next elf can enter the hall only after the one before him found a place to sit.\n - The elf labeled $k$ will first approach the dwarf labeled $A_ k$. If there isn\u2019t an elf sitting beside the dwarf, he will sit there.

He has studied all the fighters and determined the strength of each one.
