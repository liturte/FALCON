It uses a recursive function to calculate the number of offices. The base case is n = 1, where there is one office. For n > 1, the number of offices is double the number of offices for n-1, plus one for the new office.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the number of offices can be calculated by doubling the number of offices for n-1 and adding one. This is a simplification and may not accurately represent the actual calculation. The actual calculation may require more complex logic to handle the constraints of the lucky numbers and the maximum length of the door-plate number.", "def max_offices(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 4\n    else:\n        return 2 * max_offices(n - 1) + 2 ** (n - 2)\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_offices(n))\n\n\nThis Python program uses a recursive function to calculate the maximum number of offices that can have unique lucky numbers not longer than n digits. The base cases are when n is 1 or 2. For n > 2, the number of offices is double the number of offices for n - 1, plus 2 raised to the power of n - 2. The recursion stops when n is 1 or 2.

A lucky number is a number that consists of digits 7 and 8 only.\n\nIf n = 1, the maximum number of offices is 2 because there are 2 lucky numbers: 7 and 8.\n\nIf n > 1, the maximum number of offices is 2^n because for each additional digit, you can add either a 7 or an 8, so you can have 2^n different lucky numbers.\n\nThe solution is implemented as a function max_offices that takes n as input and returns the maximum number of offices. The function is then called with the input from the user and the result is printed.", "n = int(input())\nprint(2**n)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe maximum number of offices with unique lucky numbers not longer than n digits is 2^n. This is because for each digit we have two options (7 or 8), and we have n digits. So, we have 2 options for each digit, and n digits, which gives us 2^n offices.\n\nThis is a simple mathematical problem that can be solved with a bit of knowledge of binary numbers and the properties of exponentiation.\n\nThis problem is a good example of a problem that can be solved with a simple mathematical formula, rather than needing a complex algorithm or loop.\n\nThe input is read using the `input` function, and the result is printed using the `print` function.\n\nThe `int` function is used to convert the input string to an integer. The `**` operator is used to calculate the power of a number.\n\nThe solution is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a valid integer, and does not include any error checking for invalid input.\n\nThe problem statement also does not specify the maximum value of n, but the Python `int` function can handle arbitrarily large integers, so there is no practical limit on the value of n.\n\nThe output of the solution is the maximum number of", "def max_offices(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 4\n    else:\n        return 2 * max_offices(n-1)\n\nprint(max_offices(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider the number of offices that can be formed by using n digits. If n is 1 or 2, the number of offices can be directly calculated. For n > 2, the number of offices can be doubled than the number of offices that can be formed by n-1 digits. This is because for each office that can be formed by n-1 digits, we can add a 7 or 8 to the end of the number to form a new office.\n\nThe recursive function `max_offices` calculates the maximum number of offices that can be formed by using n digits. The base cases are when n is 1 or 2. The recursive case is when n > 2.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input and passed to the `max_offices` function. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), because it only needs to calculate the number of offices for each value of n from 1 to n. The space complexity is O"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe numbers of all offices in the new building of the Tax Office of IT City will have lucky numbers.\n\nLucky number is a number that consists of digits 7 and 8 only.
