If the input is 'A', it prints 'T'. If the input is 'C', it prints 'G'. If the input is 'G', it prints 'C'. If the input is 'T', it prints 'A'. This is a simple way to solve the problem using conditional statements in Python.\n\nRemember to run this program in an environment where Python is installed and configured.\n\nAlso, the input and output of the program should be in the format described in the problem statement.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is always a single character and that it is one of the four bases. If there is a chance of receiving more than one character or a character that is not one of the four bases, you would need to add additional error checking code.\n\nThis code is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for a variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n\nThis code is a simple solution to the problem and does not include any error checking or validation of the input. If you plan to use this code in a production environment, you should add appropriate error checking and validation to", "b = input()\nif b == 'A':\n    print('T')\nelif b == 'C':\n    print('G')\nelif b == 'G':\n    print('C')\nelse:\n    print('A')\n\n\nThis python program will take a base as input and print the base that bonds with it.\n\nThe if-elif-else structure is used to handle the different cases for each input base.\n\nIn the case of 'A', the program prints 'T'.\nIn the case of 'C', the program prints 'G'.\nIn the case of 'G', the program prints 'C'.\nIn the case of 'T', the program prints 'A'.\n\nThis program does not consider invalid inputs, as the problem constraints state that the input will always be one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.\n\nThe program runs in O(1) time complexity, as there are only four possible inputs.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as there is no additional space used that scales with the size of the input.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the code\nprint(run_code(code))\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\nQuestion 2: Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number. The function should take an integer as an argument and return the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than", "b = input()\nif b == 'A':\n    print('T')\nelif b == 'C':\n    print('G')\nelif b == 'G':\n    print('C')\nelse:\n    print('A')\n\n\nThis Python program will take an input letter b and print the letter representing the base that bonds with the base b. It uses an if-elif-else statement to check the input and print the corresponding output.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A', the program will print 'T' as 'A' bonds with 'T'. If the input is 'C', the program will print 'G' as 'C' bonds with 'G'. If the input is 'G', the program will print 'C' as 'G' bonds with 'C'. If the input is 'T', the program will print 'A' as 'T' bonds with 'A'.\n\nThis program will work for all possible inputs as specified in the constraints.\n\nNOTE: This solution assumes that the input will always be one of the four bases: A, C, G, or T. If there is a possibility of receiving other inputs, additional error checking should be added to handle those cases.\n\nNOTE: The question states that \"A bonds with T, and C bonds with G.\" This means that 'A' and 'T' are bonded together, and 'C' and 'G' are bonded together. So, if a base is bonded with 'A', it is bonded with 'T', and if", "b = input()\nif b == 'A':\n    print('T')\nelif b == 'C':\n    print('G')\nelif b == 'G':\n    print('C')\nelse:\n    print('A')\n\n\nThis Python program will take a character as input, check it and print the corresponding bonding base. It uses a series of if-elif-else statements to check the input and print the corresponding output.\n\nPlease note that the input and output are case sensitive. If the input is not one of the four bases (A, C, G, T), the program will not produce the expected output.", "b = input()\nif b == 'A':\n    print('T')\nelif b == 'T':\n    print('A')\nelif b == 'C':\n    print('G')\nelse:\n    print('C')\n\n\nThis Python code takes a character as input and checks whether it's A, T, C or G. Based on that, it prints the corresponding base that bonds with the given base.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A', the output will be 'T' because A bonds with T. If the input is 'T', the output will be 'A' because T bonds with A. If the input is 'C', the output will be 'G' because C bonds with G. If the input is 'G', the output will be 'C' because G bonds with C.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always one of the four bases: A, C, G, and T.\n\nPlease note that this code is written in Python language. If you want to write the solution in different programming languages, you may need to adjust the syntax accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that this code doesn't include any error checking or validation. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add checks to ensure that the input is one of the four bases: A, C, G, and T.\n\n\nThis Python code will take a character as input and print the corresponding base that bonds with the given base.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A', the output will"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nOn the Planet AtCoder, there are four types of bases: A, C, G and T.
