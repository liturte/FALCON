Yraglac has been trying to farm materials for hours on end so he can promote his units but has suddenly realized that he has forgotten about an integral system that might speed this up: the crafting system!\n\nSome higher tier materials can be crafted by combining lower tier ones. Yraglac has a list of materials that he needs, but would also like to know how many lower tier materials he would need if he wanted to take advantage of the crafting recipes. As it turns out, some of those lower tier materials might also be craftable with even lower tier materials and so on. Yraglac would like to know the numbers for each of these.\n\nFor example, suppose Yraglac needed $3$ Sugar Boxes. Crafting one of these requires $2$ Sugar Packs, $1$ Iron Chunk, and $1$ Magnesium Ore. You can also craft $1$ Iron Chunk using $3$ Iron Ores.
