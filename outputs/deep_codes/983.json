He saw Marvolo Gaunt's Ring and identified it as a Horcrux. Although he destroyed it, he is still affected by its curse. Professor Snape is helping Dumbledore remove the curse. For this, he wants to give Dumbledore exactly x drops of the potion he made. \n\nValue of x is calculated as maximum of p\u00b7a_{i} + q\u00b7a_{j} + r\u00b7a_{k} for given p, q, r and array a_1, a_2, ... a_{n} such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2264 n. Help Snape find the value of x. Do note that the value of x may be negative.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains 4 integers n, p, q, r ( - 10^9 \u2264 p, q, r \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nNext line of input contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, ... a_{n} ( - 10^9 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer the maximum value of p\u00b7a_{i} + q\u00b7a_{j} + r\u00b7a_{k} that can be obtained provided 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2264 n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1 2 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n30\n\nInput\n5 1 2 -3\n-1 -2 -3 -4 -5\n\nOutput\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, we can take i = j = k = 5, thus making the answer as 1\u00b75 + 2\u00b75 + 3\u00b75 = 30.\n\nIn second sample case, selecting i = j = 1 and k = 5 gives the answer 12.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
