This solar system is shaped like a tree. More precisely, some planets are connected by bidirectional hyperspace tunnels in such a way that there is a path between every pair of the planets, but removing any tunnel would disconnect some of them.\n\nThe Resistance already has measures in place that will, when the time is right, enable them to control every planet that is not remote. A planet is considered to be remote if it is connected to the rest of the planets only via a single hyperspace tunnel.\n\nHow much work is there left to be done: that is, how many remote planets are there?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000) \u2013 the number of planets in the galaxy.\n\nThe next N - 1 lines describe the hyperspace tunnels between the planets. Each of the N - 1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 N) indicating that there is a bidirectional hyperspace tunnel between the planets u and v. It is guaranteed that every two planets are connected by a path of tunnels, and that each tunnel connects a different pair of planets.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nA single integer denoting the number of remote planets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 1\n4 2\n1 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\n1 2\n4 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, only planets 2, 3 and 5 are connected by a single tunnel.\n\nIn the second example, the remote planets are 2 and 3.\n\nNote that this problem has only two versions \u2013 easy and medium.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
