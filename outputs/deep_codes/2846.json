The H-Index is the largest number h such that there are h papers with at least h citations. The code keeps track of this number and increments it for each paper until it finds a paper with a citation count lower than the current H-Index. The final H-Index is then printed out.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the number of papers and the number of citations are always correct.", "n = int(input())\ncitations = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\ncitations.sort(reverse=True)\n\nh_index = 0\nfor i, citation in enumerate(citations):\n    if citation >= i + 1:\n        h_index = i + 1\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(h_index)\n\n\nThis code first takes the number of papers and the citations for each paper as input. It then sorts the citations in descending order. It then iterates over the sorted list of citations, and for each citation, it checks if the citation is greater than or equal to the number of papers remaining (i+1).

If the citation is less than the number of papers remaining, it breaks the loop as there can't be a higher h", "n = int(input())\ncitations = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\ncitations.sort(reverse=True)\nh_index = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if citations[i] >= i + 1:\n        h_index = i + 1\n    else:\n        break\nprint(h_index)\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading in the number of papers and the number of citations for each paper.

It then iterates over the sorted list of citations, and for each citation, it checks if it is greater than or equal to the number of papers that have been processed so far (i.e., `i + 1`).

It returns the largest number i such that the i-th paper has at least i citations.

It then sorts the citations in ascending order. It then iteratively checks each citation to see if it is less than the number of papers that have not yet been checked. If it is, it increments the h_index by 1. Finally, it returns the value of h_index, which is the h-index.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that the number of papers is the length of the list of citations.

One way that people determine how good you are is by looking at your $H$-Index.\n\nEach paper has a certain number of citations. Your $H$-Index is the largest number $H$ such that you have $H$ papers with at least $H$ citations. Given the number of citations on each paper you have written, what is your $H$-Index?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$\u00a0($1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$), which is the number of papers you have written.\n\nThe next $n$ lines describe the papers. Each of these lines contains a single integer $c$\u00a0($0 \\leq c \\leq 1000000000$), which is the number of citations that this paper has.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay your $H$-Index.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n7\n1\n2\n1\n5\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n7\n1\n3\n1\n5\nSample Output 2:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
