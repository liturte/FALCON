{"4357": {"code": ["A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A+B+C, A+B*C, A*B+C, A*B*C))\n\n\nThis code works by taking three integers as input, representing the values on the integer panels of the game. It then calculates the four possible outcomes of the game (X + Y, X + Y * Z, X * Y + Z, and X * Y * Z), and prints the maximum of these outcomes.\n\nThis solution assumes that the game's rules are followed strictly, i.e., that the operator panel must be placed between the two numbers, and that the numbers are not rearranged. It also assumes that the operators are to be interpreted as addition and multiplication, with the usual precedence rules.\n\nThis solution works under the assumption that the maximum allowance is obtained by maximizing the result of the formula", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B + C, A * B * C, A + B * C, A * B + C, (A + B) * C, A * (B + C)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe maximum possible amount of the allowance is the maximum of the results of the six possible formulas: X + Y, X - Y, X * Y, (X + Y) * Z, X * (Y + Z), and X * Y * Z. This is because the maximum value of the allowance is obtained when the two numbers are as close to each other as possible.\n\nSo, we calculate the values of the six formulas and take the maximum of them.\n\nThe calculation of the six formulas is done as follows:\n - A + B + C: The sum of the three numbers.\n - A *", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B + C, A * B * C, A + B * C, A * B + C, (A + B) * C, A * (B + C)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe maximum possible amount of the allowance is obtained by arranging the panels in a way that gives the maximum value. This is achieved by placing the operator in such a way that it gives the maximum possible value. In this case, the operator is placed in the middle of the panels, between A and B. Therefore, the maximum possible value is obtained by adding A and B, and then multiplying the result by C. The other possible values are calculated similarly. The maximum of these six values is then returned as the maximum possible amount of the allowance.\n\nThis solution assumes that the operator is placed in the middle of the panels,", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B + C, A * B * C, A + B * C, A * B + C, (A + B) * C, A * (B + C)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a simple Python program that reads three integers from input, and prints the maximum of the following six possible values:\n\n1. A + B + C\n2. A * B * C\n3. A + B * C\n4. A * B + C\n5. (A + B) * C\n6. A * (B + C)\n\nThese are the six possible outcomes of the game, and the maximum of these outcomes is the maximum possible amount of the allowance.\n\nIn the game, the player can construct formulas of the form X + Y or X * Y, where", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B + C, A * B * C, A + B * C, A * B + C, (A + B) * C, A * (B + C)))\n\n\nThis Python program reads three integers A, B, and C from input. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible value of the formula A + B + C, A * B * C, A + B * C, A * B + C, (A + B) * C, and A * (B + C). The maximum of these values is the maximum possible amount of the allowance.\n\nThe reason for calculating all these possibilities is that the possible outcomes of the game are the sum of the numbers, the product of the numbers, and the sum of one number multiplied by the product of the other two numbers.\n\nThe max function"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have decided to give an allowance to your child depending on the outcome of the game that he will play now.\nThe game is played as follows:\n - There are three \"integer panels\", each with a digit between 1 and 9 (inclusive) printed on it, and one \"operator panel\" with a + printed on it.\n - The player should construct a formula of the form X + Y, by arranging the four panels from left to right. (The operator panel should not be placed at either end of the formula.)\n - Then, the amount of the allowance will be equal to the resulting value of the formula.\nGiven the values A, B and C printed on the integer panels used in the game, find the maximum possible amount of the allowance.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq A, B, C \\leq 9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B C\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum possible amount of the allowance.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1 5 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n53\n\nThe amount of the allowance will be 53 when the panels are arranged as 52+1, and this is the maximum possible amount.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
