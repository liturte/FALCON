If two or more identical substrings $A$ follow each other in a string $S$, we can represent this aprt of $S$ as the substring $A$, enclosed by parentheses, raised to the power of the number of repetitions. E.g., the string $DOODOO$ can be factored as $(DOO)^2$, but also as $(D(O)^2)^2$. Naturally, the latter factoring is considered better since it cannot be factored any further. We say that a factoring is irreducible if it does not contain any consecutive repetition of a substring. A string may have several irreducible factorings, as seen by the example string $POPPOP$. It can be factored as $(POP)^2$, as well as $PO(P)^2OP$. The first factoring has a shorter representation and motivates the following definition. The weigh of a factoring equals the number of characters in it, excluding the parentheses and the exponents. Thus the weight of $(POP)^2$ is $3$, whereas $PO(P)^2OP$ has weight $5$.
