{"2973": {"code": ["n, t = map(", "n, t = map(", "n, t = map(", "n, t = map(", "n, t = map("], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSheila is a student and she drives a typical student car: it is old, slow, rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle on the speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she might have placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads $s$, her true speed is $s+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant (possibly negative). \n\nSheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to use this to compute $c$. The journey consisted of $n$ segments. In the $i^{\\text {th}}$ segment she traveled a distance of $d_ i$ and the speedometer read $s_ i$ for the entire segment. This whole journey took time $t$. Help Sheila by computing $c$.\n\nNote that while Sheila\u2019s speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$), the number of sections in Sheila\u2019s journey, and $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^6$), the total time. This is followed by $n$ lines, each describing one segment of Sheila\u2019s journey. The $i^{\\text {th}}$ of these lines contains two integers $d_ i$ ($1 \\le d_ i \\le 1000$) and $s_ i$ ($|s_ i| \\le 1000$), the distance and speedometer reading for the $i^{\\text {th}}$ segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the constant $c$ in miles per hour. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 5\n4 -1\n4 0\n10 3\nSample Output:\n3.000000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
