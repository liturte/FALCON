It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number. The $i$-th pile has $a_i$ stones.\n\nAlice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.\n\nOn a player's turn, they must choose exactly $\\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $\\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles).\n\nGiven the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of stones in the piles.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single string \"Alice\" if Alice wins; otherwise, print \"Bob\" (without double quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n8 8\n\nOutput\nBob\n\nInput\n4\n3 1 4 1\n\nOutput\nAlice\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ($\\frac{2}{2}=1$). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.\n\nIn the second example, Alice can remove $2$ stones from the first pile and $3$ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
