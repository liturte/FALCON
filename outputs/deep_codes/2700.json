This is because for each value of `x` in the range `[a, b]`, there are `(d - c + 1)` possible values for `y` in the range `[c, d]`. Therefore, there are `(b - a + 1) * (d - c + 1)` total solutions.\n\nThis code simply reads the input, applies the formula and prints the", "def solve(a, b, c, d):\n    return (b - a + 1) * (d - c + 1)\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n    print(solve(a, b, c, d))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of solutions x < y is given by the product of the number of solutions for x and y.
