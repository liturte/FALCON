The dp[i] stores the number of ways to fill the first i tiles. The base cases are dp[0] = 1 (only one way to fill no tiles) and dp[2] = 1 (two ways to fill two tiles). For i > 2, we can either put a vertical shape or a horizontal shape. If we put a vertical shape, the problem becomes to fill the first i - 2 tiles. If we put a horizontal shape, the problem becomes to fill the first j tiles and the remaining (i - j - 2) tiles.

The number of ways to fill the tiles is stored in an array `ways`. The base cases are `ways[1] = 0` and `ways[2] = 1`. For `i > 2`, the number of ways to fill the `i`-th tile is the sum of the number of ways to fill the `(i-1)`-th and `(i-2)`-th tiles, plus `1` (to consider the case where a new shape is added to the `(i-2)`-th tile). The function `countWays(n)` returns the number of ways to fill the `n`-th tile.\n\nThe input `n` is read from the", "def solve(n):\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        return 0\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):\n        dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 2]\n        for j in range(i - 4, -1, -2):\n            dp[i] += dp[j] * 2\n    return dp[n]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(solve(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of ways to fill a `3*i` grid. For each `i`, we consider two cases. If we place a single square in the middle of the `3*i` grid, then the remaining `3*(i-2)` grid can be filled in `dp[i-2]` ways. If we place two squares in the middle of the `3*i` grid, then we can place the first square in `i-4` ways, and the remaining `3*(", "def num_ways(n):\n    if n % 2 == 1: return 0\n    if n == 0: return 1\n    return num_ways(n - 2) * 3\n\nprint(num_ways(int(input())))\n\n\nThis solution uses recursion to calculate the number of ways to fill the tiles. The base case is when `n` is `0`, in which case there is `1` way to fill (no tiles). If `n` is an odd number, there are no ways to fill, so it returns `0`. If `n` is an even number, it calculates the number of ways to fill `n - 2` tiles, and multiplies it by `3` (since there are three possible shapes to fit on the remaining `2` tiles).\n\nThis solution assumes that the shapes are square and that the width of the shape is `2`. If the shapes are different, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe solution also assumes that the shapes can be rotated and flipped. If the shapes can't be rotated or flipped, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe solution assumes that the tiles are square and that the width of the tiles is `1`.
