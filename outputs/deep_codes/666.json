The sequence repeats every 60 numbers. We calculate the modulus of n by the cycle length (60) to find the position of the number in the current cycle. This gives us a number from 1 to 60. We then add 1 to this number to get the correct position in the sequence.\n\nThis solution", "def find_nth_number(n):\n    cycle_length = 1\n    while n > cycle_length * (cycle_length + 1) / 2:\n        n -= cycle_length * (cycle_length + 1) / 2\n        cycle_length += 1\n    return cycle_length - (n - 1) % cycle_length\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(find_nth_number(n))\n\n\nThis Python code solves the problem by first determining the cycle length of the sequence (which is determined by the formula `cycle_length * (cycle_length + 1) / 2`), and then"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nConsider the infinite sequence of integers: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... The sequence is built in the following way: at first the number 1 is written out, then the numbers from 1 to 2, then the numbers from 1 to 3, then the numbers from 1 to 4 and so on. Note that the sequence contains numbers, not digits. For example number 10 first appears in the sequence in position 55 (the elements are numerated from one).\n\nFind the number on the n-th position of the sequence.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^14) \u2014 the position of the number to find.\n\nNote that the given number is too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the element in the n-th position of the sequence (the elements are numerated from one).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n10\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n55\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n56\n\nOutput\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
