Then it enters a loop where it continues as long as Tim has enough empty bottles to buy a new soda. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the number of new sodas he can buy and adds it to the total number of sodas he has drunk (`d`). Then it updates the number of empty bottles Tim has left (`b`), which is the number of bottles he initially had plus the number of bottles he found during the day minus the number of bottles he bought. Finally, it prints the total number of sodas Tim has drunk.\n\nThe `//` operator is used to perform integer division (i.e., division that rounds down to the nearest whole", "def soda_drink(e, f, c):\n    total_bottles = e + f\n    sodas = total_bottles // c\n    remaining_bottles = total_bottles % c\n    while remaining_bottles >= c:\n        sodas += remaining_bottles // c\n        remaining_bottles = remaining_bottles % c\n    return sodas\n\nprint(soda_drink(9, 0, 3))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program calculates the total number of empty soda bottles Tim has at the start of the day, adds the empty bottles found during the day, and divides by the number of bottles required to buy a new soda to get the number of sodas he can buy. The number of remaining bottles is calculated using the modulus operator. If there are enough remaining bottles to buy another soda, the process is repeated until there are not enough bottles left. The number of sodas is returned.\n\nIn the example given, there are", "def extra_thirsty_soda(e, f, c):\n    total_bottles = e + f\n    sodas = total_bottles // c\n    while total_bottles >= c:\n        left = total_bottles % c\n        total_bottles //= c\n        sodas += total_bottles\n        total_bottles += left\n    return sodas\n\n\nSample usage:\n\nprint(extra_thirsty_soda(9, 0, 3))  # Output: 4\n\n\nThis code works by first calculating the total number of empty bottles Tim has at the start of the day. It then enters a loop that continues until there are less than $c$ empty bottles left. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates how many bottles are left after the current number of bottles are consumed, and adds this to the total number of sodas. It also adds any leftover bottles from the current consumption to the total. The number of sodas"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker, he simply cannot get enough. Most annoyingly though, he almost never has any money, so his only obvious legal way to obtain more soda is to take the money he gets when he recycles empty soda bottles to buy new ones. In addition to the empty bottles resulting from his own consumption he sometimes find empty bottles in the street. One day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn\u2019t afford a new one.\n\n-----Input-----\nThree non-negative integers $e,f,c$, where $e<1000$ equals the number of empty soda bottles in Tim\u2019s possession at the start of the day, $f<1000$ the number of empty soda bottles found during the day, and $2 \\le c<2000$ the number of empty bottles required to buy a new soda.\n\n-----Output-----\nHow many sodas did Tim drink on his extra thirsty day?\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n9 0 3\nSample Output:\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
