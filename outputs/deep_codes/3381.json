You have purchased a square-shaped land in Singapore, represented as a square on a two dimensional Cartesian plane. The size of your land is $(4 \\cdot 10^7) \\times (4 \\cdot 10^7)$.\n\nAfter much deliberation, your engineers have devised the optimal shape of your new main office. It will be a grand building, shaped as a convex polygon on the two dimensional grid (a convex polygon is a simple polygon such that for any two of its vertices, the straight line connecting the two vertices is completely inside the polygon). More specifically, your main office is represented by a polygon with at least $3$ vertices such that:\n - Each vertex is located on a lattice point (lattice points are points which coordinates are integers).\n - The coordinates of all vertices are between $0$ and $4 \\cdot 10^7$, inclusively.\n - All vertices are located on distinct points.\n - No three vertices are collinear (that is, no three vertices should be on a line).\n - All the vertices form a convex polygon in some order.\n\nIt is a known fact that the number of vertices composing your main office is very important. A lucky number would positively influence the chance of success for all of your evil missions. Thus, given $N$, the number of vertices of the main office, can you generate any one possible way to construct your main office?
