It then calculates the sum as explained in the problem statement. The sum is then printed.\n\nThe sum of all integers from 1 to n is calculated using the formula `(n*(n+1))//2`. The number at n is subtracted from this sum to get the final answer. The reason for subtracting n is because n is included in the sum twice: once as a positive number and once as a negative number.\n\nThe `//` operator is used for division in Python to get an integer result.\n\nThis code assumes that the input values of n are valid and does not include any error checking.", "def solve(n):\n    return sum(i if i % 2 == 0 else -i for i in range(1, n + 1))\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(solve(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe solve function calculates the sum by iterating from 1 to n (inclusive) and for each i, it checks if i is even or not. If i is even, it is added to the sum, otherwise, it is subtracted.\n\nThe main part of the code reads the number of test cases t from the input and for each test case, it reads the value of n and calls the solve function to calculate the sum. The result is printed on the standard output.\n\nThis code is written in Python and is efficient because it uses a generator expression to calculate the sum which is more memory-efficient than a list comprehension.", "t = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    print(n*(n+1)//2 - 2*n*(n//2)*(n//2+1))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nWe can calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n by using the formula n*(n+1)/2. However, we need to subtract the sum of all powers of two from 2 to n. \n\nThe sum of all powers of two from 2 to n can be calculated by the formula n*(n//2)*(n//2+1). We can use this formula to calculate the sum of all powers of two that are smaller than or equal to n. \n\nSo, the final sum is n*(n+1)/2 - 2*n*(n//2)*(n//2+1).\n\nThis solution is efficient because it calculates the", "def calculate_sum(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i & (i-1):\n            sum += i\n        else:\n            sum -= i\n    return sum\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(calculate_sum(n))\n\nThis code first defines a helper function calculate_sum that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, where all powers of two have a minus sign if the integer is a power of two. This is done by checking if the binary representation of the integer has any 1 bits at positions other than the least significant bit. If it does, we add the integer to the sum; otherwise, we subtract it.\n\nThen, for each test case, the code reads the number of test cases t and the integers n to be processed from the input. For each n", "t = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(((n*(n+1))//2) - (n*(n+1))//2)\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe sum of all integers from 1 to n is given by the formula (n*(n+1))/2. The sum of all powers of 2 from 1 to n is also given by the formula (2^(k+1) - 1), where k is the highest integer such that 2^k <= n.\n\nThe sum of all integers from 1 to n minus the sum of all powers of 2 from 1 to n gives the desired result. This can be calculated as ((n*(n+1))//2) - ((2^(k+1) - 1)).\n\nThe code reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads n and"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n, but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum.\n\nFor example, for n = 4 the sum is equal to  - 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 =  - 4, because 1, 2 and 4 are 2^0, 2^1 and 2^2 respectively.\n\nCalculate the answer for t values of n.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of values of n to be processed.\n\nEach of next t lines contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the requested sum for each of t integers n given in the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n4\n1000000000\n\nOutput\n-4\n499999998352516354\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe answer for the first sample is explained in the statement.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
