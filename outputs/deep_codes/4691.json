First, we input the number of test cases and the verdicts. Then, we use the count method of the list to count the number of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE' verdicts.

First, we take the number of test cases N as input. Then we take a list S of N strings as input, where each string is a verdict for a test case. We then print the counts of each verdict by using the count method of the list S.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\nThis", "n = int(input())\nverdicts = [input() for _ in range(n)]\nprint('AC x', verdicts.count('AC'))\nprint('WA x', verdicts.count('WA'))\nprint('TLE x', verdicts.count('TLE'))\nprint('RE x', verdicts.count('RE'))\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `input()` function to get the number of test cases and the list of verdicts.

Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively.\nSee the Output section for the output format.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - S_i is AC, WA, TLE, or RE.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nS_1\n\\vdots\nS_N\n\n-----Output-----\nLet C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively. Print the following:\nAC x C_0\nWA x C_1\nTLE x C_2\nRE x C_3\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\nAC\nTLE\nAC\nAC\nWA\nTLE\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nAC x 3\nWA x 1\nTLE x 2\nRE x 0\n\nWe have 3, 1, 2, and 0 test case(s) for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
