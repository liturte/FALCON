That is, if i \\neq j, there exists k such that X_{ik} \\neq X_{jk}.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN D\nX_{11} X_{12} ... X_{1D}\nX_{21} X_{22} ... X_{2D}\n\\vdots\nX_{N1} X_{N2} ... X_{ND}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) such that the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point is an integer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\n1 2\n5 5\n-2 8\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nThe number of pairs with an integer distance is one, as follows:\n - The distance between the first point and the second point is \\sqrt{|1-5|^2 + |2-5|^2} = 5, which is an integer.\n - The distance between the second point and the third point is \\sqrt{|5-(-2)|^2 + |5-8|^2} = \\sqrt{58}, which is not an integer.\n - The distance between the third point and the first point is \\sqrt{|-2-1|^2+|8-2|^2} = 3\\sqrt{5}, which is not an integer.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
