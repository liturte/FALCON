In Operation i (1 \\leq i \\leq Q), an integer T_i is provided, which means the following:\n - If T_i = 1: reverse the string S.\n - If T_i = 2: An integer F_i and a lowercase English letter C_i are additionally provided.\n - If F_i = 1 : Add C_i to the beginning of the string S.\n - If F_i = 2 : Add C_i to the end of the string S.\nHelp Takahashi by finding the final string that results from the procedure.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^5\n - S consists of lowercase English letters.\n - 1 \\leq Q \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - T_i = 1 or 2.\n - F_i = 1 or 2, if provided.\n - C_i is a lowercase English letter, if provided.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\nQ\nQuery_1\n:\nQuery_Q\n\nIn the 3-rd through the (Q+2)-th lines, Query_i is one of the following:\n1\n\nwhich means T_i = 1, and:\n2 F_i C_i\n\nwhich means T_i = 2.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the resulting string.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\na\n4\n2 1 p\n1\n2 2 c\n1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\ncpa\n\nThere will be Q = 4 operations. Initially, S is a.\n - Operation 1: Add p at the beginning of S. S becomes pa.\n - Operation 2: Reverse S. S becomes ap.\n - Operation 3: Add c at the end of S. S becomes apc.\n - Operation 4: Reverse S. S becomes cpa.\nThus, the resulting string is cpa.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
