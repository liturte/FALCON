The variables in this language have names consisting of $1$ to $4$ characters, and each character is a lowercase or an uppercase Latin letter, or a digit. There is an extra constraint that the first character should not be a digit.\n\nThere are four types of operations in the program, each denoted by one of the characters: $, ^, # or &.\n\nEach line of the program has one of the following formats:   <lvalue>=<rvalue>, where <lvalue> and <rvalue> are valid variable names;  <lvalue>=<arg1><op><arg2>, where <lvalue>, <arg1> and <arg2> are valid variable names, and <op> is an operation character. \n\nThe program is executed line-by-line, and the result of execution is stored in a variable having the name res. If res is never assigned in the program, then the result will be equal to the value of res before running the program.\n\nTwo programs are called equivalent if no matter which operations do characters $, ^, # and & denote (but, obviously, performing the same operation on the same arguments gives the same result) and which values do variables have before execution of program, the value of res after running the first program is equal to the value of res after running the second program (the programs are executed independently).\n\nYou are given a program consisting of $n$ lines. Your task is to write a program consisting of minimum possible number of lines that is equivalent to the program you are given.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of lines in the program.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow \u2014 the program itself. Each line corresponds to the format described in the statement and has no extra whitespaces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print $k$ \u2014 the minimum number of lines in the equivalent program.\n\nThen print $k$ lines without any whitespaces \u2014 an equivalent program having exactly $k$ lines, in the same format it is described in the statement.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\nc=aa#bb\nd12=c\nres=c^d12\ntmp=aa$c\n\nOutput\n2\naaaa=aa#bb\nres=aaaa^aaaa\n\nInput\n2\nmax=aaaa$bbbb\nmin=bbbb^aaaa\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
