For example, the $5$-th child was given $1$ candy, to the left of him $2$ children were given $1$ candy, $1$ child was given $2$ candies and $1$ child\u00a0\u2014 $3$ candies, so there are $2$ children to the left of him that were given more candies than him.\n\nIn the second example it is impossible to distribute the candies, because the $4$-th child made a mistake in calculating the value of $r_4$, because there are no children to the right of him, so $r_4$ should be equal to $0$.\n\nIn the last example all children may have got the same number of candies, that's why all the numbers are $0$. Note that each child should receive at least one candy.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
