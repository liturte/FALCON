It then prints this remainder.\n\nPlease note that the input and output format is as per the problem statement.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the input will always be a list of integers.\n\nIf you want to use the function `solve()` in other contexts, you should add some error checking to ensure that the input is a list and that all elements of the list are integers.", "print(sum(int(x) for x in input().split()) % 10)\n\n\nThis code reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input, sums them, and then prints the remainder when divided by 10.\n\nIt does this by first splitting the line into a list of strings with `input().split()`, then converting each string to an integer with `int(x)`, summing them all with `sum()`, and finally getting the remainder with `%`.\n\nNote that the `%` operator in Python returns the remainder of the division.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be valid, so no error checking is done.\n\nAlso note that the `print()` function automatically includes a newline at the end, so there's no need to manually add one.\n\nThis code can be run in any Python 3 environment.\n\nThe problem statement seems to be a translation of a poem into code. The code itself doesn't make much sense as a poem, but it does give a good example of how to read and process input", "print(sum([int(i) for i in input().split()]) % 2)\n\n\nThe code takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then sums up all the integers. It then finds the remainder of the sum when divided by 2. The result is printed out.\n\nThe 'sum' function is a built-in Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum. The 'split' function is a built-in Python function that splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space). The '%' operator is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of division.\n\nThe '[int(i) for i in input().split()]' part is a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a list in Python. It works by iterating over each string in the list returned by 'input().split()', converting that string to an integer, and adding it to a new list.\n\nThe 'print' function is a built-"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSalve, mi amice.\n\nEt tu quidem de lapis philosophorum.
