{"462": {"code": ["x1,x2,x3 = map(int, input().split())\nprint(abs(x2-x1)+abs(x3-x1))\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the absolute difference of the x-coordinates of the friends and their common point (x1) as the total distance each friend has to travel. The sum of these distances is the minimum total distance they have to travel.\n\nThe map function is used to convert the input string to integers. The split function is used to split the input string into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by map.\n\nThe abs function is used to get the absolute value of the difference,", "print(sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])[1]-sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])[0])\n\n\nThis Python code works by taking the input, splitting it into a list of integers, sorting the list, and then subtracting the first element (the smallest number) from the second element (the second smallest number). This gives the minimum total distance the friends need to travel.\n\nThis code is efficient because it uses the built-in sorting function, which is implemented as a variant of the quicksort algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n). The time complexity of the code is thus", "x1, x2, x3 = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(abs(x1-x2)+abs(x1-x3), abs(x2-x1)+abs(x2-x3), abs(x3-x1)+abs(x3-x2)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking for the minimum total distance to travel among three friends to meet at one point. The total distance is the sum of distances from each friend's current point to the meeting point. We can calculate this for all possible meeting points (x1, x2, x3) and choose the minimum one", "print(sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])[1]-sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])[0])\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code takes the three coordinates as input, sorts them, and then takes the difference between the second smallest and the smallest number. This difference is the minimum distance the friends need to travel to meet at the same point.\n\nThe sorted function is used to arrange the numbers from smallest to largest. The [1] and [0] indices are used to get the second smallest and smallest numbers respectively. The difference between these two numbers is the minimum total distance the friends have to travel.", "x1, x2, x3 = map(int, input().split())\nprint(abs(x2 - x1) + abs(x3 - x1))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe minimum total distance is the sum of the distances from each friend's point to the meeting point. The distance between two points is the absolute difference between their coordinates. We calculate the distances for each friend and sum them up.\n\nFor example, if the coordinates of the friends' houses are 7, 1, and 4 respectively, the distances would be:\n\n- The distance from the first friend's house (7) to the meeting point (4) is"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are three friend living on the straight line Ox in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point x_1, the second friend lives at the point x_2, and the third friend lives at the point x_3. They plan to celebrate the New Year together, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total distance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the New Year?\n\nIt's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three distinct integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (1 \u2264 x_1, x_2, x_3 \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and the third friends respectively. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum total distance the friends need to travel in order to meet together.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 1 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n30 20 10\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, friends should meet at the point 4. Thus, the first friend has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 7 to the point 4), the second friend also has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 1 to the point 4), while the third friend should not go anywhere because he lives at the point 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
