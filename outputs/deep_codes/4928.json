The maximum number of pieces that can be cut is obtained by the formula (n+1)^2, where n is the number of cuts.\n\nThe reason why we add 1 to n before squaring it is because the cuts can be made at the edges of the chessboard, and these edges can be cut into pieces. This means that the number of cuts is actually one more than the number of pieces that can be cut, so we add 1 to n before squaring it to get the correct result.", "def max_pieces(n):\n    return n+1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_pieces(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe maximum number of pieces Slavko's chessboard can crash into is the number of cuts Mirko can make plus one. This is because each cut divides the board into two pieces. Since Mirko can make $N$ cuts, he can potentially cut the board into $N+1$ pieces.\n\nThe code reads the number of cuts from the input, calls the function `max_pieces` with this number, and prints the result.", "def max_pieces(n):\n    return n+1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_pieces(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe maximum number of pieces that can be shattered by Mirko is the number of cuts he can make plus one. This is because each cut divides the board into two pieces, and Mirko can make at most N cuts. Therefore, he can shatter at most N+1 pieces.\n\nThis solution is implemented in Python. The function `max_pieces` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `n+1`. The `input` function is used to read the number of cuts from the standard input, and the `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThe code does not need any explanations or comments because it is straightforward and self-explanatory.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the chessboard is square and that", "def max_pieces(n):\n    return (n+1)*(n+1)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(max_pieces(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe maximum number of pieces that a chessboard can crash into is the number of squares on it. This is because each cut can either divide the board into two squares, or cut one of the squares into two smaller squares. Therefore, the number of cuts plus one is the maximum number of squares that the board can be divided into. The number of squares is the square of the number of cuts, so we return (n+1)*(n+1).\n\nThe input function reads the number of cuts from the user and the print function outputs the maximum number of pieces.\n\nThe code is written in Python and is meant to be run in a command line environment.\n\nThe input and output are read from the standard input and output respectively", "def max_pieces(N):\n    return N + 1\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(max_pieces(N))\n\n\nThis code reads the number of cuts Mirko can make from the input, and then uses the function `max_pieces` to calculate the maximum number of pieces Slavko's chessboard can crash into. The formula used is `N + 1`, because each cut divides the board into two pieces, and Mirko can make at most `N` cuts. The `+ 1` is to account for the original piece that remains after all the cuts.\n\nThe result is then printed to the output.\n\nNote that this code assumes that Mirko can only make cuts at the edges of the board, and that the board starts as a single piece. If the board starts with multiple pieces, or if Mirko can make cuts anywhere on the board, the formula would need to be adjusted accordingly."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThrilled about his new valid set of pieces, Mirko rushed over to Slavko\u2019s, to find that Slavko too found a set of chess pieces in his attic. Slavko\u2019s set, miraculously, contains only black pieces. But since neither of them can play chess, they settled on smashing one another senseless with their chessboards.\n\nWhile Slavko is warming up with a series of stretches, Mirko decided to sabotage Slavko\u2019s chessboard. An expert in carving wood, he decided to cut Slavko\u2019s chessboard so that it shatters into as many pieces as possible when Slavko attempts to hit Mirko.\n\nMirko can only make horizontal and vertical cuts (parallel to the sides to the board), edge to edge, and has time to make at most $N$ cuts.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^9$), the number of cuts Mirko can make.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the largest number of pieces Slavko\u2019s chessboard can crash into.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nSample Output:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
