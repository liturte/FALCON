It turned out that he had a red socks and b blue socks.\n\nAccording to the latest fashion, hipsters should wear the socks of different colors: a red one on the left foot, a blue one on the right foot.\n\nEvery day Vasya puts on new socks in the morning and throws them away before going to bed as he doesn't want to wash them.\n\nVasya wonders, what is the maximum number of days when he can dress fashionable and wear different socks, and after that, for how many days he can then wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got.\n\nCan you help him?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains two positive integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of red and blue socks that Vasya's got.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two space-separated integers \u2014 the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks and the number of days when he can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got.\n\nKeep in mind that at the end of the day Vasya throws away the socks that he's been wearing on that day.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n\nOutput\n1 1\n\nInput\n2 3\n\nOutput\n2 0\n\nInput\n7 3\n\nOutput\n3 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Vasya can first put on one pair of different socks, after that he has two red socks left to wear on the second day.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
