It then calculates the maximum count of either '0' or '1' in `S`, and prints this value as the maximum integer `K`. This is because the maximum integer `K` must be the maximum count of either '0' or '1' in `S`, because that is the minimum number of operations required to turn all the characters of `S` into '0'.\n\nThis solution has a time", "s = input()\nk = len(s)\nwhile k > 0:\n    for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):\n        if s[i:i+k].count('0') <= k // 2:\n            print(k)\n            exit(0)\n    k -= 1\nprint(0)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads the string s, and then tries to find the maximum length k of a substring such that all characters in the substring are 0s. It does this by checking all possible substring lengths from the length", "s = input()\n\n# Count the number of 0s and 1s in the string\ncount_0 = s.count('0')\ncount_1 = s.count('1')\n\n# The maximum number of flips is the minimum of the number of 0s and 1s.\nprint(min(count_0, count_1))\n\n\nThis solution works by counting the number of 0s and 1s in the string. The maximum number of flips is the minimum of these two counts, because we can flip each 1 to a 0 and vice versa.", "def solve():\n    S = input()\n    N = len(S)\n    K = 0\n    for k in range(1, N+1):\n        if k*k > N*2:\n            break\n        flag = True\n        for i in range(N-k+1):\n            if i+k > N:\n                break\n            count = 0\n            for j in range(i, i+k):\n                if S[j] == '1':\n                    count += 1\n            if count*2 > k:\n                flag = False\n                break\n        if", "def solve(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    zeros = [0] * (n + 1)\n    ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if s[i - 1] == '0':\n            zeros[i] = zeros[i - 1] + 1\n            ones[i] = ones[i - 1]\n        else:\n            zeros[i] = zeros[i - 1]\n            ones[i] = ones[i - 1]"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S consisting of 0 and 1.\nFind the maximum integer K not greater than |S| such that we can turn all the characters of S into 0 by repeating the following operation some number of times.\n - Choose a contiguous segment [l,r] in S whose length is at least K (that is, r-l+1\\geq K must be satisfied).
