Dima knows that if Andrew, who has been thoroughly assembling the tree for a long time, comes home and sees his creation demolished, he'll get extremely upset. \n\nTo not let that happen, Dima has to recover the binary search tree. Luckily, he noticed that any two vertices connected by a direct edge had their greatest common divisor value exceed $1$.\n\nHelp Dima construct such a binary search tree or determine that it's impossible. The definition and properties of a binary search tree can be found here.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the number of vertices $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 700$).\n\nThe second line features $n$ distinct integers $a_i$ ($2 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the values of vertices in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is possible to reassemble the binary search tree, such that the greatest common divisor of any two vertices connected by the edge is greater than $1$, print \"Yes\" (quotes for clarity).\n\nOtherwise, print \"No\" (quotes for clarity).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n3 6 9 18 36 108\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n2\n7 17\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n9\n4 8 10 12 15 18 33 44 81\n\nOutput\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe picture below illustrates one of the possible trees for the first example.
