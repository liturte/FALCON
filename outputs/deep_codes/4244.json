In this case, the first person will spend (1 - 2)^2 points of stamina, and the second person will spend (4 - 2)^2 = 4 points of stamina, for a total of 5 points of stamina. This is the minimum total stamina that the 2 people have to spend.\nNote that you can hold the meeting only at an integer coordinate.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
