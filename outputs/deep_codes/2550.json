Let $a_{i}$ be the score of the $i$-th student. You have access to the school database which stores the results of all students.\n\nYou can change each student's score as long as the following conditions are satisfied:   All scores are integers  $0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq m$  The average score of the class doesn't change. \n\nYou are student $1$ and you would like to maximize your own score.\n\nFind the highest possible score you can assign to yourself such that all conditions are satisfied.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. \n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 200$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{3}$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{5}$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of students and the highest possible score respectively.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($ 0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq m$) \u00a0\u2014 scores of the students.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each testcase, output one integer \u00a0\u2014 the highest possible score you can assign to yourself such that both conditions are satisfied._\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n4 10\n1 2 3 4\n4 5\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n10\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, $a = [1,2,3,4] $, with average of $2.5$. You can change array $a$ to $[10,0,0,0]$. Average remains $2.5$, and all conditions are satisfied.\n\nIn the second case, $0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 5$. You can change $a$ to $[5,1,1,3]$. You cannot increase $a_{1}$ further as it will violate condition $0\\le a_i\\le m$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
