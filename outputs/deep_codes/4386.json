It then checks if a is less than 3200. If it is, it prints \"red\". Otherwise, it prints the string s.\n\nThis is done by using a simple if-else statement in Python. The input() function is used to get the values of a and s from the user. The int() function is used to convert the string input for a to an integer.\n\nThe condition for the if-else statement is a < 3200. If this condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints \"red\". If the condition is false, the code inside the else block is executed, which prints the string s.\n\nThe print() function is used to output the result.", "a = int(input())\ns = input()\n\nif a < 3200:\n    print(\"red\")\nelse:\n    print(s)\n\n\nThis code reads an integer and a string from the standard input, and then prints the string if the integer is not less than 3200, otherwise it prints \"red\".", "a = int(input())\ns = input()\nprint(s if a >= 3200 else 'red')\n\n\nThis code first reads an integer a and a string s from the standard input. It then checks if a is greater than or equal to 3200. If it is, it prints s; otherwise, it prints 'red'.\n\nPlease note that in Python, the 'else' part of the ternary operator (the 'if a >= 3200 else 'red') is executed if the condition is False.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is in the correct format as specified in the constraints. If the input does not meet these constraints, the code may not work as expected.\n\nThis code does not include any error handling or input validation, so it is expected that the input will be in the correct format.\n\nThis code does not include any comments or explanations, as per the problem statement.\n\nThis code is written in Python 3.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Python program to solve the problem\na = int(input())\ns = input()\nif a >= 3200:\n    print(s)\nelse:\n    print('red')\n\n\nThis program will print the string 's'", "a = int(input())\ns = input()\nif a >= 3200:\n    print(s)\nelse:\n    print(\"red\")\n\n\nThis program first reads an integer a and a string s from the input.
