Load the first candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the first candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the second candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the second candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the third candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the third candy. \n\nHence, the train needs $5$ seconds to complete the tasks.\n\nIf the train were to start at station $2$, however, it would need to move to station $1$ before it could load the first candy, which would take one additional second. Thus, the answer in this scenario is $5+1 = 6$ seconds.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
