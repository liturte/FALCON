The cost of doing so is $(1-4)^2 + (4-5)^2 = 10$, which is optimal. This way, Alice could walk from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 4)$, use the tunnel from $(1, 4)$ to $(4, 5)$, and lastly walk from $(4, 5)$ to $(5, 5)$.\n\nIn the second sample, clearly a tunnel between cells $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$ needs to be created. The cost of doing so is $(1-3)^2 + (3-1)^2 = 8$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
