If X is less than A, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 10.\n\nThis is a simple conditional statement in Python that checks if the condition (X < A) is true or false, and executes the corresponding print statement.\n\nThe map function is used to convert the input string to integers, and the split function is used to separate the input string into two parts. The result is then stored in the variables X and A.\n\nThe if-else statement is used to check the condition and execute the corresponding block of code. If the condition is true (X < A), the print statement inside the if block is executed, otherwise, the print statement inside the else block is executed.\n\nThis code is very efficient and easy to understand.", "X, A = map(int, input().split())\nif X < A:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print(10)\n\n\nThis code takes two integers X and A as input, and then checks if X is less than A.

It uses the ternary operator (`x if condition else y`) to perform the conditional operation in a single line.\n\nIn this case, the condition is `X < A`, and the values printed are 0 and 10. If the condition is True, the value before the comma is printed, and if it's False, the value after the comma is printed.\n\nThe `map` function is used to read two integers from the input, and the `split` method is used to separate the input by whitespace.\n\nThe input format is `X A`, where X and A are single digit integers.
