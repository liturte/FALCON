{"4310": {"code": ["A = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem can be solved by sorting the array and then calculating the total cost. The minimum total cost will be achieved by completing the middle task first, then the first and last tasks. The cost of completing the middle task is 0, and the cost of completing the first and last tasks is the absolute difference between the middle and first or middle and last tasks.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because of the input array.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement. If the input can have other formats, the solution would need to be adapted accordingly.\n\nThis solution is written in Python and does not include any explanation or comment.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.", "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[2] - A[0])\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe minimum cost to complete all the tasks is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. This is because completing a task at cost 0 is free, and completing the next task at cost |A_j - A_i| will always be less than or equal to completing the largest task first.\n\nThis solution works because the cost to complete the first task is always 0, and the cost to complete the next task is always the absolute difference between the current task and the previously completed task. The smallest possible cost to complete all tasks is therefore the smallest possible sum of these costs.\n\nThe solution sorts the array and then prints the third largest value (the largest task), minus the smallest value (the first task), which is the minimum possible cost to complete all tasks.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass over the array to find the minimum cost. It also uses a constant amount of additional memory.\n\"\"\"", "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by sorting the input and then adding the differences between the sorted values. The minimum total cost will be the sum of the differences between the second smallest and smallest values and the difference between the largest and second largest values. This is because the smallest and largest values are the only ones that can be skipped, and the difference between the second smallest and smallest values and the difference between the largest and second largest values are the costs of skipping the first and third tasks respectively.\n\nThe Python code for this solution is as follows:\n\n\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1])\n\n\nIn this code, `input().split()` is used to read the input values, which are separated by spaces. The `", "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to minimize the total cost of completing the tasks. The cost of completing each task is either 0 or the absolute difference between the current task and the previously completed task. \n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to complete the tasks in ascending order of their values. So we first sort the values. Then the total cost is the sum of the differences between consecutive values. The first difference is between the smallest and the second smallest values, the second difference is between the second and the largest value.\n\nSo we print the sum of `A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1]` which is the sum of the differences between the smallest and the second smallest values and the second and the largest value.\n\nThis solution is in Python and it works by first reading the input, which is a list of three integers. Then it sorts", "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(A[1] - A[0] + A[2] - A[1])\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\""], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have three tasks, all of which need to be completed.\nFirst, you can complete any one task at cost 0.\nThen, just after completing the i-th task, you can complete the j-th task at cost |A_j - A_i|.\nHere, |x| denotes the absolute value of x.\nFind the minimum total cost required to complete all the task.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq A_1, A_2, A_3 \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA_1 A_2 A_3\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum total cost required to complete all the task.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1 6 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nWhen the tasks are completed in the following order, the total cost will be 5, which is the minimum:\n - Complete the first task at cost 0.\n - Complete the third task at cost 2.\n - Complete the second task at cost 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
