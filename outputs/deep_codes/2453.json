Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.\n\nYour task is the following: for every $k \\in [1..n]$, calculate the number of points with integer coordinates such that the number of segments that cover these points equals $k$. A segment with endpoints $l_i$ and $r_i$ covers point $x$ if and only if $l_i \\le x \\le r_i$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of segments.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain segments. The $i$-th line contains a pair of integers $l_i, r_i$ ($0 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^{18}$) \u2014 the endpoints of the $i$-th segment.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n$ space separated integers $cnt_1, cnt_2, \\dots, cnt_n$, where $cnt_i$ is equal to the number of points such that the number of segments that cover these points equals to $i$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n0 3\n1 3\n3 8\n\nOutput\n6 2 1 \n\nInput\n3\n1 3\n2 4\n5 7\n\nOutput\n5 2 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe picture describing the first example:\n\n[Image]\n\nPoints with coordinates $[0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]$ are covered by one segment, points $[1, 2]$ are covered by two segments and point $[3]$ is covered by three segments.\n\nThe picture describing the second example:\n\n[Image]\n\nPoints $[1, 4, 5, 6, 7]$ are covered by one segment, points $[2, 3]$ are covered by two segments and there are no points covered by three segments.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
