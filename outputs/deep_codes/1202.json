If k = 0, the finalists are determined by the time only, so players 9840, 9860, 9920 and 9930 advance to the finals.  If k = 1, the winners from both semifinals move to the finals (with results 9840 and 9920), and the other places are determined by the time (these places go to the sportsmen who run the distance in 9860 and 9930 milliseconds).  If k = 2, then first and second places advance from each seminfial, these are participants with results 9840, 9860, 9920 and 9980 milliseconds.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
