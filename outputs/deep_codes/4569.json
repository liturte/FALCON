{"4569": {"code": ["S = input()\n\nif S == \"Sunny\":\n    print(\"Cloudy\")\nelif S == \"Cloudy\":\n    print(\"Rainy\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Sunny\")\n\n\nThis Python program works by taking the input string S, and then checks if it's \"Sunny\". If it is, it prints \"Cloudy\". If it's not \"Sunny\", it then checks if S is \"Cloudy\", and if it is, it prints \"Rainy\". If S is neither \"Sunny\" nor \"Cloudy\", it must be \"Rainy\", so it prints \"Sunny\".\n\nThis program is a simple switch-case statement, which is a common way to handle this kind of problem in many programming languages.\n\nThis program works by mapping each day of the cycle to the next day in the cycle, and then printing the mapped day based on the input.\n\nThis program assumes that the input will always be one of the three possible strings, \"Sunny\", \"Cloudy\", or \"Rainy\", as specified in the problem statement. If the input is something else, the program will not work correctly.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution provided above is a Python script that takes an input string representing the current weather and prints the expected weather for the next day. The weather cycle is Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy -> Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy and so", "S = input()\nif S == 'Sunny':\n    print('Cloudy')\nelif S == 'Cloudy':", "S = input()\nif S == 'Sunny':\n    print('Cloudy')\nelif S == 'Cloudy':\n    print('Rainy')\nelse:\n    print('Sunny')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe program takes a string as input, which represents the current weather. It then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the expected weather tomorrow based on the current weather. If the current weather is sunny, it prints 'Cloudy'. If the current weather is cloudy, it prints 'Rainy'. If the current weather is rainy, it prints 'Sunny'.\n\nThis is because in Takahashi's town, a sunny day is followed by a cloudy day, a cloudy day by a rainy day, and a rainy day by a sunny day.\n\nThe code is written in Python and does not require any comments or explanations.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\nS = input()\nif S == 'Sunny':\n    print('Cloudy')\nelif S == 'Cloudy':\n    print('Rainy')\nelse:\n    print('Sunny')\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test Cases:\n# Test Case 1:\n# Input: Sunny\n# Output: Cloudy\n\n# Test Case 2:\n# Input: Cloudy\n# Output: Rainy\n\n# Test Case 3:\n# Input: Rainy\n#", "S = input()\nif S == 'Sunny':\n    print('Cloudy')\nelif S == 'Cloudy':\n    print('Rainy')\nelse:\n    print('Sunny')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code first takes an input S which is the current weather.
