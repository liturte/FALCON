The bisect_right function returns the insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of b_i in a. This means that the bisect_right function returns the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to b_i.

The insertion point is the point at which the value would be inserted into the list, keeping it sorted. The function returns the index of the first element that is larger than the value, or n if all elements are smaller.\n\nHere, we first read and sort the array 'a', then for each element in 'b',", "from bisect import bisect_right\n\ndef count_numbers(a, b):\n    a.sort()\n    return [len(a) - bisect_right(a, x) for x in b]\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprint(*count_numbers(a, b))\n\n\nThis code uses the bisect function from the bisect module to find the insertion point for the value in the sorted list a. The bisect_right function returns the insertion point which would be used after the existing elements are sorted. It returns the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to b[j].\n\nThe time complexity of", "from bisect import bisect_right\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprint(' '.join(str(n - bisect_right(a, b[i])) for i in range(m)))\n\n\nThe bisect_right function from the bisect module in Python is used to find the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order. If x is already present in a, the insertion point is after (to the right of) any existing entries.\n\nThe bisect_right function returns the index of the first item greater than the value we are looking for.
