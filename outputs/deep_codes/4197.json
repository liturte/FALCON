It then iterates over the range of `n`, and for each iteration, it finds the index of the current number in `a` (which corresponds to the order in which the student entered the classroom), and prints that index plus one (since the problem statement is 1-indexed). The `end=' '` argument is used to print all the numbers on the same line, separated by spaces.", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nstudents = [0] * (N + 1)\nfor i in range(N):\n    students[A[i]] = i + 1\n\nstudents.sort()\nfor i in range(1, N + 1):\n    print(students[i], end=\" \")\n\n\nThis solution works by creating an empty list `students` of size `N + 1` to store the student numbers in the order they entered the classroom. For each student `i`, it stores the order they entered the classroom in `students[A[i]]`.\n\nThen, it sorts the `students` list. The first element of the sorted list (at index 0) is not used (it's 0 by default), so it prints the elements from index 1 to N (inclusive).\n\nThis solution assumes that the student numbers and the order they entered the classroom", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA.sort()\nprint(' '.join(map(str, A)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is asking to sort the input list A in ascending order. The sorted list represents the order in which the students entered the classroom. The sorted list is then printed.\n\nThe sort function sorts the list in ascending order. The join function is used to convert the list to a string, and the map function is used to convert the integers in the list to strings. The result is a string of the student numbers, separated by spaces.\n\nThe time complexity of the sort function is O(N log N), where N is the number of students. The space complexity is O(N), as the sort function creates a new list to store the sorted elements.\n\nSo, the overall time complexity of the program is O(N log N), and the space complexity is O(N).\n\"\"\"\n\n# S", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the students based on their entry time in ascending order\nsorted_students = sorted(range(1, N + 1), key=lambda i: A[i - 1])\n\n# Print the student numbers in the order they entered the classroom\nprint(*sorted_students)\n\n\nThis Python code reads the number of students N and the list of entry times A from the input. It then sorts the students based on their entry time in ascending order and prints their student numbers. The sorted function is used with a lambda function as the key to sort the students based on their entry time in the A list. The * operator is used to print the elements of the sorted_students list without brackets and commas.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is given in the correct format and that the constraints are met.
