{"206": {"code": ["from", "def", "m", "import", "import"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.\n\nLet $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.\n\nGiven an integer $m$, find $\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 5 3\n\nOutput\n19\n\nInput\n1000000000 1 2019\n\nOutput\n500000001500000001\n\nInput\n100 100000 1\n\nOutput\n101\n\nInput\n6 4 5\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.\n\nIn the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.\n\nIn the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
