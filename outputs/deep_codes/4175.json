Determine if the rules of shiritori was observed, that is, every word announced by him satisfied the conditions.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer satisfying 2 \\leq N \\leq 100.\n - W_i is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nW_1\nW_2\n:\nW_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf every word announced by Takahashi satisfied the conditions, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\nhoge\nenglish\nhoge\nenigma\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nNo\n\nAs hoge is announced multiple times, the rules of shiritori was not observed.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
