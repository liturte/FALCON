No packet may be used more than once in the formation of the single $x$, however it may be reused for the formation of other $x$'s.\n\nFind the minimum number of packets in such a distribution.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of coins you have.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of packets, satisfying the condition above.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, three packets with $1$, $2$ and $3$ coins can be made to get any amount $x$ ($1\\leq x\\leq 6$).  To get $1$ use the packet with $1$ coin.  To get $2$ use the packet with $2$ coins.  To get $3$ use the packet with $3$ coins.  To get $4$ use packets with $1$ and $3$ coins.  To get $5$ use packets with $2$ and $3$ coins  To get $6$ use all packets. \n\nIn the second example, two packets with $1$ and $1$ coins can be made to get any amount $x$ ($1\\leq x\\leq 2$).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
