However, choosing which songs to play is turning out to be very tricky; there are just way too many good songs and you only have enough time to play a measly nine songs! \n\nIn order to give the show a sense of continuity, you have decided that consecutive songs you play should have some detail in common. For instance, if you start by playing Bj\ufffdrk\u2019s song \u201cPagan Poetry\u201d, you could continue with next playing matmos\u2019 track \u201cEnigma Machine for Alan Turing\u201d since matmos contributed to Bj\ufffdrk\u2019s Vespertine album (on which Pagan Poetry appears).

The ordering of the songs is important, so just because you could play song X after song Y it will not necessarily be the case that you can play song Y after song X. At the same time as achieving this sense of continuity, you also want the playlist to have a bit of variation, so all nine songs must be by different artists.\n\nYou have narrowed things down to a bunch of your favorite songs, but finding a list of nine songs with a common thread seems tricky.

Then follow $n$ lines. Each line describes a song, starting with the name of the artist (as a string of \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019 of at most $15$ characters), followed by an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 40$), the number of songs that can be played directly after this song. Then follows (on the same line) $t$ distinct integers $s_1, \\ldots , s_ t$, each between $1$ and $n$, giving the numbers of the songs that can be played after the current song.
