The function returns the index `m` of the first occurrence of the same number `n` in the sequence `a`, where `m > n`. The input number `s` is read", "def f(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return n / 2\n    else:\n        return 3 * n + 1\n\ndef get_sequence(s):\n    sequence = [s]\n    while True:\n        s = f(s)\n        if s in sequence:\n            return sequence[:sequence.index(s)] + [s]\n        sequence.append(s)\n\ndef solve(s):\n    sequence = get_sequence(s)\n    return sequence.index(sequence[-1]) + 1\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\nThe code is a Python solution. It first defines the function `f(n)`, which is the function described in the problem. Then it defines the function `get_sequence(s)`, which generates the sequence starting from `s`", "def solve():\n    s = int(input())\n    a = [0] * 1000001\n    a[1] = s\n    a[2] = s*2 if s%2==0 else 3*s+1\n    for i in range(3, 1000001):\n        a[i] = i//2 if a[i-1]%2==0 else 3*a[i-1]+1\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            if a[j] == a[i]:\n                return i\n    return -1\nprint(solve())\n\n\nThis solution uses a list `a` to store the sequence generated by the function `f`. It starts by initializing `a[1]` and `a[2]`,", "s = int(input())\na = [s]\nwhile True:\n    if s % 2 == 0:\n        s = s // 2\n    else:\n        s = 3 * s + 1\n    if s in a:\n        print(a.index(s))\n        break\n    a.append(s)\n\n\nThis python code works by taking the input `s` and initializing a list `a` with `s`. Then it enters a loop where it checks if `s` is even or odd. If `s` is even, it divides `s` by 2. If `s` is odd, it multiplies `s` by 3 and adds 1. If `s` is already in `a`, it prints the index of `s` in `a` and breaks the loop. If `s`", "def f(n):\n    return n / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1\n\ndef solve(s):\n    a = [s]\n    for i in range(1, 10**6):\n        a.append(f(a[-1]))\n        if a[-1] in a[:-1]:\n            return len(a[:a.index(a[-1])])\n\ns = int(input())\nprint(solve(s))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `f` is defined to calculate the next term of the sequence based on whether the current term is even or odd. The `solve` function generates the sequence and checks for the condition that there exists an integer `n` such that `a_m = a_n` (m > n).
