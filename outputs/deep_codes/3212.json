A number of snakes are on the field at various positions, and each snake can strike a particular distance in any direction. Can Bill make the trip without being bitten?\n\nAssume that the southwest corner of the field is at $(0,0)$ and the northwest corner at $(0,1000)$. Bill must enter the field somewhere between the southwest and northwest corner and must leave somewhere between the southeast and northeast corners.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a line containing $0 \\le n \\le 1000$, the number of snakes. A line follows for each snake, containing three integers: the $(x,y)$ location of the snake ($0 \\le x, y \\le 1000$) and its strike distance $1 \\le d \\le 1000$. The snake will bite anything that passes strictly closer than this distance from its location.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Bill can complete the trip, give coordinates with exactly two decimal digits at which he may enter and leave the field. Use the format shown in the sample input. If Bill may enter and leave at several places, give the most northerly. If there is no such pair of positions, print \u201cBill will be bitten.\u201d\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n500 500 499\n0 0 999\n1000 1000 200\nSample Output 1:\nBill enters at (0.00, 1000.00) and leaves at (1000.00, 800.00).\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n250 250 300\n750 250 300\n250 750 300\n750 750 300\nSample Output 2:\nBill will be bitten.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
