Today, he has told a story about how Denis helped him to come up with an interesting problem and asked the crew to solve it.\n\nIn the beginning, uncle Bogdan wrote on a board a positive integer $x$ consisting of $n$ digits. After that, he wiped out $x$ and wrote integer $k$ instead, which was the concatenation of binary representations of digits $x$ consists of (without leading zeroes).

Denis decided to wipe last $n$ digits of $k$ and named the new number as $r$.\n\nAs a result, Denis proposed to find such integer $x$ of length $n$ that $r$ (as number) is maximum possible. If there are multiple valid $x$ then Denis is interested in the minimum one.\n\nAll crew members, including captain Flint himself, easily solved the task. All, except cabin boy Kostya, who was too drunk to think straight.
