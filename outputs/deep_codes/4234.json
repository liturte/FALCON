For example, the strings good, string and xyyx are good strings, and the strings bad, aa and aabc are not good. Note that the empty string is considered good.\n\nYou are given a string $s$, you have to delete minimum number of characters from this string so that it becomes good.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of characters in $s$.\n\nThe second line contains the string $s$, consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print one integer $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimum number of characters you have to delete from $s$ to make it good.\n\nIn the second line, print the resulting string $s$.
