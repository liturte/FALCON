Each prefix must be non-empty, and any of the prefixes can be the full name. Typically there are multiple possible logins for each person.\n\nYou are given the first and the last name of a user. Return the alphabetically earliest login they can get (regardless of other potential Polygon users).\n\nAs a reminder, a prefix of a string s is its substring which occurs at the beginning of s: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\" etc. are prefixes of string \"{abcdef}\" but \"b\" and 'bc\" are not. A string a is alphabetically earlier than a string b, if a is a prefix of b, or a and b coincide up to some position, and then a has a letter that is alphabetically earlier than the corresponding letter in b: \"a\" and \"ab\" are alphabetically earlier than \"ac\" but \"b\" and \"ba\" are alphabetically later than \"ac\".\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings: the first and the last names. Each character of each string is a lowercase English letter. The length of each string is between 1 and 10, inclusive. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single string\u00a0\u2014 alphabetically earliest possible login formed from these names. The output should be given in lowercase as well.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nharry potter\n\nOutput\nhap\n\nInput\ntom riddle\n\nOutput\ntomr\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
