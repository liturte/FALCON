A lesser known adage is one about shooting a can of exploding worms with a BB gun.\n\nImagine we place some cans of exploding worms on a long, straight fence. When a can is shot, all of the worms inside will explode. Different types of worms have different blast radii. Each can contains only one kind of worm.\n\nWhen a can explodes, if another can is in the blast radius, then that can will also explode, possibly creating a chain reaction. Each can explodes only once. This process continues until all explosions stop.\n\nFor each can, suppose that it is the only can shot. How many cans in total will explode?\n\n-----Input-----\nThere will be a single test case in the input. This test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100000$) representing the number of cans on the fence. Each of the next $n$ lines will have two integers $x$ ($-10^9 \\le x \\le 10^9$) and $r$ ($1 \\le r \\le 10^9$), where $x$ is the location of the can on the fence and $r$ is the blast radius. No two cans will occupy the same location.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint $n$ integers on a single line separated by single spaces. The $i^{th}$ integer represents the number of cans that will explode if the $i^{th}$ can is the one that is shot.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n4 3\n-10 9\n-2 3\nSample Output:\n1 2 1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
