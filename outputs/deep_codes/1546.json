Then he drew arcs to join the pairs of integers (a, b) (a \u2260 b), that are either each other's immediate neighbors in the circle, or there is number c, such that a and \u0441 are immediate neighbors, and b and c are immediate neighbors. As you can easily deduce, in the end Vasya drew 2\u00b7n arcs.\n\nFor example, if the numbers are written in the circle in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (in the clockwise direction), then the arcs will join pairs of integers (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1) and (5, 2).\n\nMuch time has passed ever since, the numbers we wiped off the blackboard long ago, but recently Vasya has found a piece of paper with 2\u00b7n written pairs of integers that were joined with the arcs on the board. Vasya asks you to find the order of numbers in the circle by these pairs.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (5 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) that shows, how many numbers were written on the board.
