The reason is that the hands of the clocks will point upward at the same time if and only if their rotation times are the multiples of each other. Therefore, the time when all the clocks point upward is the LCM of their rotation times. The function `lcm(a,"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have N clocks. The hand of the i-th clock (1\u2264i\u2264N) rotates through 360\u00b0 in exactly T_i seconds.\n\nInitially, the hand of every clock stands still, pointing directly upward.\n\nNow, Dolphin starts all the clocks simultaneously.\n\nIn how many seconds will the hand of every clock point directly upward again?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2264N\u2264100 \n - 1\u2264T_i\u226410^{18} \n - All input values are integers.  \n - The correct answer is at most 10^{18} seconds.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:  \nN\nT_1\n:  \nT_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of seconds after which the hand of every clock point directly upward again.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n2\n3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n6\n\nWe have two clocks. The time when the hand of each clock points upward is as follows:\n - Clock 1: 2, 4, 6, ... seconds after the beginning\n - Clock 2: 3, 6, 9, ... seconds after the beginning\nTherefore, it takes 6 seconds until the hands of both clocks point directly upward.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
