For example, if you stack three mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, you have a 3-layered kagami mochi; if you put just one mochi, you have a 1-layered kagami mochi.\nLunlun the dachshund has N round mochi, and the diameter of the i-th mochi is d_i centimeters. When we make a kagami mochi using some or all of them, at most how many layers can our kagami mochi have?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n - 1 \u2264 d_i \u2264 100\n - All input values are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nd_1\n:\nd_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum number of layers in a kagami mochi that can be made.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n10\n8\n8\n6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nIf we stack the mochi with diameters of 10, 8 and 6 centimeters from bottom to top in this order, we have a 3-layered kagami mochi, which is the maximum number of layers.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
