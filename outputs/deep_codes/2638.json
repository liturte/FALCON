For each element, we update its value to be the smaller of the two elements below it plus its own value. The result will be the top element of the triangle after all updates.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and the input triangle. The time complexity is O(n^2) because we iterate through the entire triangle.\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) because we use an array of size n to store the result. The time complexity is O(n^2) because we iterate through the triangle twice, once for updating the result and once for calculating the minimum sum.\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) because we use an array of size n to store the result.

For each element, it adds the smaller of the two elements directly below it to the current element, and then moves up to the next level of the triangle. The result is the smallest sum path from the top to the bottom.\n\nThis solution is O(n), as it only requires a list of size n to store the current level of the triangle. The space complexity is also O(n), as it uses a list of size n to store the result.\n\nIt is important to note that this solution modifies the input triangle, which may not be desirable if the original triangle is needed elsewhere in the code. If this is the case, a deep copy of the triangle should be made before the loop begins.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input triangle is a list of lists, where each inner list is one row of the triangle.

It iterates over the triangle from the bottom to the top. For each element, it picks the smaller of the two elements below it and adds the value of the current element. The result is stored in the same triangle row. The minimum path sum is stored in the first element of the triangle after the loop.\n\nThis solution has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result and the triangle. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the total number of rows in the triangle. This is because it iterates over the triangle once for each row.\n\nThis solution satisfies the bonus requirement of using O(n) extra space.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is a valid triangle as described in the problem statement.

It starts from the last row of the triangle (res is initialized as this row), and for each row above, it finds the minimum path sum to the next row and adds the current value.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n) as we iterate over each element once, and the space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of space.\n\nWe start from the bottom of the triangle, and for each row, we update our result list in place. The result for each element is the minimum of the two elements below it plus the current element. After we have gone through all the rows, the minimum path sum is stored in the first element of the result list.\n\nThe result list is updated in place, so it only takes O(1) space for each row.

It uses the fact that the minimum path to each node is the minimum of the two paths below it plus the value of the node itself. The result is stored in the same list as the triangle, reducing the space complexity to O(1) since only one list is used.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the number of rows in the triangle, as each node is visited once and updated once.
