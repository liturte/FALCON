If it is, the number is a perfect square.\n\nThen it defines a function `solve` that takes an array of numbers, and returns the maximum number in the array that is not a perfect square.

It then uses a list comprehension to filter out the numbers that are perfect squares. The `math.isqrt()` function is used to get the integer square root of a number, and if the square of this root is not equal to the original number, it means that the number is not a perfect square. The `max()` function is then used to get the largest of these non-square numbers.\n\nNote that `math.isqrt()", "import math\n\nn = int(input())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_num = -10**6-1\n\nfor num in nums:\n    sqrt_num = math.sqrt(num)\n    if sqrt_num != int(sqrt_num):\n        max_num = max(max_num, num)\n\nprint(max_num)\n\n\nThis code first takes the input of the number of elements and the elements of the array. It then initializes the maximum number to be -10^6-1 (as all elements of the array are guaranteed to be greater than this).\n\nIt then iterates over each number in the array. For each number, it calculates the square root. If the square root is not an integer,", "import math\n\nn = int(input())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_number = max(numbers)\n\nwhile max_number >= 0:\n    if math.sqrt(max_number) % 1 != 0:\n        print(max_number)\n        break\n    max_number -= 1\n\n\nThis program works by first taking the maximum number in the array. It then checks if the square root of this number is an integer. If it is, the number is a perfect square and is not included in the final output. If it isn't, the number is added to the output. This process is repeated with the next largest number down to 0. The first number it finds that is not a perfect square is printed as the output.\n\nThis solution is"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of n integers, find the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square.\n\nA number x is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer y such that x = y^2.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^6 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one element of the array is not a perfect square.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the largest number in the array which is not a perfect square.
