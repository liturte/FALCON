This is because we can craft a shovel with two sticks and one diamond, and a sword with two diamonds and one stick. So we are basically trying to find out how many of each tool we can craft given the amount of sticks and diamonds we have.\n\nFor each test case, we read in the number of sticks", "for _ in range(int(input())):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    a, b = b - a, a\n    print(a + (b // 3 if b % 3 == 0 else b // 3 + 1))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution works by first swapping `a` and `b` if `a > b` to ensure that `a` is always less than or equal to `b`. Then we calculate the difference between `b` and `a` for `a` and `b", "t = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    print(min(a, b) + (max(a, b) - min(a, b)) // 3)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution works by first determining the minimum number of sticks and diamonds Polycarp has. This is because he can only craft the tools that require the least amount of resources. The maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn is determined by crafting the tools that require the most resources. The remaining resources (if any) are used to craft additional tools, which can be"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nPolycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types \u2014 shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.\n\nEach tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has $a$ sticks and $b$ diamonds?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4 4\n1000000000 0\n7 15\n8 7\n\nOutput\n2\n0\n7\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel.\n\nIn the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
