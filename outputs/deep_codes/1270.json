Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.\n\nRecall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors\u00a0\u2014 1 and k. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of the output contains a single integer k\u00a0\u2014 maximum possible number of primes in representation.\n\nThe second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n2\n2 3\n\nInput\n6\n\nOutput\n3\n2 2 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
