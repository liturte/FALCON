{"4254": {"code": ["S, W = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"unsafe\" if W >= S else \"safe\")\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's `map` function to convert the input strings into integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings, and `map` applies the `int` function to each string in the list, converting them into integers. The `if W >= S else \"safe\"` part is a ternary expression that prints \"unsafe\" if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep, and \"safe\" otherwise.\n\nIt's worth noting that this solution assumes that the input will always be two integers separated by a space, as specified in the problem statement. If the input can have different formats, the solution should be adjusted accordingly.", "S, W = map(int, input().split())\nprint('unsafe' if W >= S else 'safe')\n\n\nThis program will read the number of sheep and wolves from the input, and then print \"unsafe\" if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to that of sheep, and \"safe\" otherwise.", "S, W = map(int, input().split())\nif S < 1 or S > 100 or", "S, W = map(int, input().split())\nif W >= S:\n    print('unsafe')\nelse:\n    print('safe')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads two integers S and W from the standard input. It then checks if W is greater than or equal to S. If it is, it prints \"unsafe\". Otherwise, it prints \"safe\".\n\nThis is a simple conditional statement in Python. It checks the condition W >= S and prints the corresponding message. The \">=\" operator checks if the number on its right is greater than or equal to the number on its left. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. The result of this operation is used to decide which message to print.\n\nThe map function applies the int function to every item in the input, turning them all into integers. The input().split() function splits the input into a list of strings, based on spaces. The resulting list is then passed to the map function, which applies the int function to every item in the list. The result is a list of integers. The two items in this list are then unpacked into the variables S and W.\n\nThe if-else statement is used to print either \"unsafe\" or \"safe\", depending on the condition. If the condition is True, \"unsafe\" is printed. Otherwise, \"safe\" is printed", "S, W = map(int, input().split())\nif W >= S:\n    print(\"unsafe\")\nelse:\n    print(\"safe\")\n\n\nThis code takes two integers as input from the user. It checks if the number of wolves is greater than or equal to the number of sheep. If it is, it prints \"unsafe\". Otherwise, it prints \"safe\"."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are S sheep and W wolves.\nIf the number of wolves is greater than or equal to that of sheep, the wolves will attack the sheep.\nIf the wolves will attack the sheep, print unsafe; otherwise, print safe.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq S \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq W \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS W\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the wolves will attack the sheep, print unsafe; otherwise, print safe.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nunsafe\n\nThere are four sheep and five wolves.
