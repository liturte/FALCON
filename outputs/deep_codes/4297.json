{"4297": {"code": ["N = int(input())\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    print(N)\nelse:\n    print(N * 2)\n\nThis code works by taking the input number N and checking if it is already even. If it is, then it directly prints N because N is already divisible by both 2 and itself. If N is not even, then it prints N multiplied by 2 because N is not divisible by 2 and 2N is divisible by both 2 and N.\n\nThis code is efficient because it uses a simple modulo operation to check if N is even, which takes constant time. It also uses a multiplication operation to compute the result, which also takes constant time. Therefore, the total time complexity of the code is O(1), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.\n\nThis code also works correctly for all inputs in the given constraints, because it simply multiplies N by 2 if N is not even, and leaves N unchanged if N is even. Therefore, the output will be the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 2 and N.\n\nThis code is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language.", "N = int(input())\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    print(N)\nelse:\n    print(N * 2)\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input, N, and checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, the solution simply prints N. If it isn't, the solution multiplies N by 2 and prints the result. This is because the smallest positive integer divisible by both 2 and N is simply N if N is divisible by 2, and N*2 if N is not divisible by 2.", "def find_min_divisible_by_2_and_n(n):\n    return 2 * n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(find_min_divisible_by_2_and_n(n))\n\nThe function `find_min_divisible_by_2_and_n` takes an integer `n` and returns the smallest integer that is divisible by both 2 and `n`.
