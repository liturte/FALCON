Print No otherwise.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\n#.#\n.#.\n#.#\n#.\n.#\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nThe template image B is identical to the upper-left 2 \u00d7 2 subimage and the lower-right 2 \u00d7 2 subimage of A. Thus, the output should be Yes.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
