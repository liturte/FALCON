During this grand voyage, she was accompanied by her fluffy friend, Mr.\u00a0Fluffynose the Stuffed Animal. However, after her return, it seems that she has left him somewhere along the route! This is devastating news for your little sister, and as she won\u2019t stop crying about it, you decide to retrace her steps through town. \n\nYou know that your sister will hold on to her beloved Fluffynose whenever possible, so the only time she could\u2019ve lost it is when she grabbed an item on her shopping list. So, all you have to do is figure out at what store she bought what, and then you\u2019ll reunite her with her counterpart in no time! However, you soon find out that this isn\u2019t quite as easy as you thought: she went to a lot of stores, and although she knows the names of the stores she went to and the order in which she visited them, she does not recall what she bought at each store (it could have been nothing!). It would take a lot of time to blindly search all the stores for all these items. As you have better things to do today, like solving programming problems, you want to spend as little time on this retrieval as possible. Therefore, you want to know exactly which items your sister bought at each store before you start your search.\n\nFor this you have two pieces of information: firstly you know the inventory of all stores your sister went to. Secondly, you know exactly in what order she purchased the groceries, as she has very carefully stacked all items into her bag. You decide to number the stores your sister visited according to the order in which she visited them. Given this information, you want to decide whether you know for sure where she bought every item so you can retrace her steps as efficiently as possible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line with a single integer $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$, the number of supermarkets in town. Then follows a line with an integer $N\\leq K \\leq 100000$, after which $K$ lines follow with a space-separated integer $i$ (between $0$ and $N-1$) and a string $S$ (consisting of only lowercase letters, at most $10$), denoting that item $S$ is available at the $i^\\text {th}$ store that your sister visited. It is guaranteed that every store has at least one item, every item is available at at least one store, and that every item occurs at most once at every store.\n\nThe second part of the input contains a", "QUESTION:\nYour little sister has been a big help today: she went into town to do all the groceries!
