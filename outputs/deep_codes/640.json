First each of them writes an integer from 1 to 6, and then a dice is thrown. The player whose written number got closer to the number on the dice wins. If both payers have the same difference, it's a draw.\n\nThe first player wrote number a, the second player wrote number b. How many ways to throw a dice are there, at which the first player wins, or there is a draw, or the second player wins?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 6)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers written on the paper by the first and second player, correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint three integers: the number of ways to throw the dice at which the first player wins, the game ends with a draw or the second player wins, correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 5\n\nOutput\n3 0 3\n\nInput\n2 4\n\nOutput\n2 1 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe dice is a standard cube-shaped six-sided object with each side containing a number from 1 to 6, and where all numbers on all sides are distinct.\n\nYou can assume that number a is closer to number x than number b, if |a - x| < |b - x|.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
