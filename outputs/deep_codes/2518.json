Each monster has a parameter called health, and the health of the i-th monster is h_i at the moment of encounter. A monster will vanish immediately when its health drops to 0 or below.\nFortunately, you are a skilled magician, capable of causing explosions that damage monsters. In one explosion, you can damage monsters as follows:\n - Select an alive monster, and cause an explosion centered at that monster. The health of the monster at the center of the explosion will decrease by A, and the health of each of the other monsters will decrease by B. Here, A and B are predetermined parameters, and A > B holds.\nAt least how many explosions do you need to cause in order to vanish all the monsters?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All input values are integers.\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n - 1 \u2264 B < A \u2264 10^9\n - 1 \u2264 h_i \u2264 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN A B\nh_1\nh_2\n:\nh_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of explosions that needs to be caused in order to vanish all the monsters.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 5 3\n8\n7\n4\n2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nYou can vanish all the monsters in two explosion, as follows:\n - First, cause an explosion centered at the monster with 8 health. The healths of the four monsters become 3, 4, 1 and -1, respectively, and the last monster vanishes.\n - Second, cause an explosion centered at the monster with 4 health remaining. The healths of the three remaining monsters become 0, -1 and -2, respectively, and all the monsters are now vanished.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
