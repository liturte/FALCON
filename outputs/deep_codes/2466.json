The dfs function is a recursive function that takes a list of numbers, a path, and a result list as input. If the input list is empty, it appends the current path to the result list. Otherwise, it iterates over the input list, recursively calling dfs on the remaining numbers and appending the current number to the path.\n\nThe permute function initializes an empty result list and calls dfs with the input list, an empty path, and the result list. It returns the result list when dfs has completed.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*n!) because it generates n factorial permutations and takes O(n) time to generate each permutation.\n\nIt uses O(n) space for the recursion stack and the output list, so the space complexity is O(n).\n\n\nThe code provided above is the solution for the problem in Python language.", "class Solution:\n    def permute(self, nums):\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, path, result):\n        if not nums:\n            result.append(path)\n            # return # backtracking\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums[:i]+nums[i+1:], path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nclass Solution:\n    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, path, result):\n        if not nums:\n            result.append(path)\n            # return # backtracking\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums[:i]+nums[i+1:], path+[nums[i]], result)\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "class Solution:\n    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        if len(nums) == 0:\n            return []\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            return [nums]\n        res = []\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            n = nums[i]\n            remaining = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]\n            for p in self.permute(remaining):\n                res.append([n] + p)\n        return res\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each number in the list. It then creates a list of all possible permutations of the remaining numbers (which are calculated using recursion). Finally, it appends the current number to the beginning of each permutation in the list.\n\nThis solution is based on the idea that to get all permutations of a list, you can take each number in the list, and then get all permutations of the remaining numbers. This is done recursively until the list has only one number, at which point the list is just returned.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*n!) because for each number in the list, it generates all permutations of the remaining numbers, which takes O(n) time, and there are n numbers in the list. The space complexity is O(n*n!) because each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, and the maximum depth of the call stack is n (for a list of size n).\n\nPlease note that this solution", "class Solution:\n    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, path, result):\n        if not nums:\n            result.append(path)\n            return \n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums[:i]+nums[i+1:], path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nThis is a backtracking algorithm. It works by selecting each number in turn, recursively generating permutations for the remaining numbers, and appending these to the current path. When there are no more numbers to select, the current path is a complete permutation, so it is added to the result.\n\nThe dfs function is a recursive function that generates permutations. It takes three arguments:\n\n- nums: the list of numbers remaining to select.\n- path: the current permutation.\n- result: the list of permutations found so far.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when there are no numbers left to select (i.e., nums is empty), at which point the current path is a complete permutation and is added to the result.\n\nFor each number in nums, the function recursively generates permutations for the remaining numbers, and appends the current number to these permutations.\n\nThe function then returns the list of permutations.\n\nThis solution uses a depth-first", "class Solution:\n    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, path, result):\n        if not nums:\n            result.append(path)\n            # return # backtracking\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            self.dfs(nums[:i]+nums[i+1:], path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The base case is when there are no more numbers to pick (i.e., when `nums` is empty), at which point we have a complete permutation and add it to the result list.\n\nFor each number in the list, we remove it and add it to the path, then recursively call `dfs` on the remaining numbers. After the recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last number from the path and adding it back to the numbers list. This is the backtracking step.\n\nThe recursive calls will continue until all numbers have been used, resulting in all possible permutations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*n!) because there are n choices for the first number, (n-1) choices for the second number, and so on, leading to n*n*...*2*1 = n factorial calls.
