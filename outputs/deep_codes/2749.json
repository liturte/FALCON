Here, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = H W.\n - For each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), the squares painted in Color i are 4-connected. That is, every square painted in Color i can be reached from every square painted in Color i by repeatedly traveling to a horizontally or vertically adjacent square painted in Color i.\nFind a way to paint the squares so that the conditions are satisfied.\nIt can be shown that a solution always exists.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 H, W \u2264 100\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 H W\n - a_i \u2265 1\n - a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = H W\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint one way to paint the squares that satisfies the conditions.\nOutput in the following format:\nc_{1 1} ... c_{1 W}\n:\nc_{H 1} ... c_{H W}\n\nHere, c_{i j} is the color of the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n3\n2 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1 1\n2 3\n\nBelow is an example of an invalid solution:\n1 2\n3 1\n\nThis is because the squares painted in Color 1 are not 4-connected.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
