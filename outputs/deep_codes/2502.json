Determine if the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, and find the maximum value of such i if the number is finite.\n - There exists a non-negative integer j such that the concatenation of i copies of t is a substring of the concatenation of j copies of s.\n\n-----Notes-----\n - A string a is a substring of another string b if and only if there exists an integer x (0 \\leq x \\leq |b| - |a|) such that, for any y (1 \\leq y \\leq |a|), a_y = b_{x+y} holds.\n - We assume that the concatenation of zero copies of any string is the empty string. From the definition above, the empty string is a substring of any string. Thus, for any two strings s and t, i = 0 satisfies the condition in the problem statement.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq |s| \\leq 5 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq |t| \\leq 5 \\times 10^5\n - s and t consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\ns\nt\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, print the maximum value of such i; if the number is infinite, print -1.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nabcabab\nab\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThe concatenation of three copies of t, ababab, is a substring of the concatenation of two copies of s, abcabababcabab, so i = 3 satisfies the condition.\nOn the other hand, the concatenation of four copies of t, abababab, is not a substring of the concatenation of any number of copies of s, so i = 4 does not satisfy the condition.\nSimilarly, any integer greater than 4 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the condition is finite, and the maximum value of such i is 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
