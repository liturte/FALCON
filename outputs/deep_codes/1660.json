As you know, he's really weak at graph theory; so try to help him in solving the problem.\n\nYou are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. You need to find a path (perhaps, non-simple) with maximum number of edges, such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. In other words, each edge of the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.\n\nHelp Pashmak, print the number of edges in the required path.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5;\u00a01 \u2264 m \u2264 min(n\u00b7(n - 1), 3\u00b710^5)). Then, m lines follows. The i-th line contains three space separated integers: u_{i}, v_{i}, w_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n;\u00a01 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 10^5) which indicates that there's a directed edge with weight w_{i} from vertex u_{i} to vertex v_{i}.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n3 1 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6 7\n1 2 1\n3 2 5\n2 4 2\n2 5 2\n2 6 9\n5 4 3\n4 3 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the maximum trail can be any of this trails: $1 \\rightarrow 2,2 \\rightarrow 3,3 \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nIn the second sample the maximum trail is $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nIn the third sample the maximum trail is $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 6$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
