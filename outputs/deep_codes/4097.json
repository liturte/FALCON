So, after Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to $[25, 20, 15, 10]$, which is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the fourth example Polycarp should change only the first element, he should decrease it on one. After that his sequence will looks like $[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]$, which is an arithmetic progression.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
