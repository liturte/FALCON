Vanya wonders whether he can weight an item with mass m using the given weights, if the weights can be put on both pans of the scales. Formally speaking, your task is to determine whether it is possible to place an item of mass m and some weights on the left pan of the scales, and some weights on the right pan of the scales so that the pans of the scales were in balance.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers w, m (2 \u2264 w \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number defining the masses of the weights and the mass of the item.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint word 'YES' if the item can be weighted and 'NO' if it cannot.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 7\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n100 99\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n100 50\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote to the first sample test. One pan can have an item of mass 7 and a weight of mass 3, and the second pan can have two weights of masses 9 and 1, correspondingly. Then 7 + 3 = 9 + 1.\n\nNote to the second sample test. One pan of the scales can have an item of mass 99 and the weight of mass 1, and the second pan can have the weight of mass 100.\n\nNote to the third sample test. It is impossible to measure the weight of the item in the manner described in the input.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
