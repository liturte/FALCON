This is because the number of possible assignments is equal to the minimum of S and K (since Z can take values from 0 to K), plus one (for the case when S is equal to K).\nIf S is not within the valid range, it prints 0.\nThe solution is written in Python.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that X, Y, and Z can take integer values from 0 to K, and X + Y + Z = S.

It iterates over all possible values of X and Y from 0 to K, and for each pair (X, Y), it calculates Z = S - X - Y. If Z is in the range 0 to K, it counts this triple as a valid solution. The total count of valid solutions is then printed.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that K and S are small enough to fit into memory. If they are larger, you would need to use a", "K, S = map(int, input().split())\n\nif S > 3 * K or S < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((S - K + 1) * (S - K + 1))\n\n\nThis Python code first reads two integers K and S from the input. If S is not in the range [2, 3K], it prints 0 and terminates. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the square of (S - K + 1), which is the number of triples (X, Y, Z) satisfying X + Y + Z = S.\n\nThe reason we are squaring (S - K + 1) is that for each possible value of X (or Y or Z), there are (S - K + 1) possible values for the other two variables. Therefore, there are (S - K + 1) * (S - K + 1) triples that satisfy the condition.\n\nThis solution", "def solve(k, s):\n    count = 0\n    for x in range(k + 1):\n        for y in range(k + 1):\n            for z in range(k + 1):\n                if x + y + z == s:\n                    count += 1\n    return count\n\nk, s = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(k, s))\n\nThis solution uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible values of X, Y and Z. For each combination, it checks if X + Y + Z equals S. If so, it increments a counter.
