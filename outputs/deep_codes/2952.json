If it is, it is impossible for all items to be picked by everyone, so we print \"impossible\". If it's not, then it's possible for some items to be picked by everyone, so we print \"possible\".\n\nThe `map()` function is used to convert the input string into integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings, each of which is one of the numbers in the input string. The `int()` function converts each substring into an integer.\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the sum of the numbers is greater than `m`. If it is, the condition is true and \"impossible\" is printed", "m, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif a + b + c > m:\n    print(\"impossible\")\nelse:\n    print(\"possible\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code works by first taking in the input values and storing them in the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `m`. If it is, it prints \"impossible\". Otherwise, it prints \"possible\". This is because if the sum of the items picked by Alice, Bob, and Clara is greater than the total number of items on the menu, it is impossible for all items to be picked by everyone.", "m, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif a + b + c > m:\n    print(\"impossible\")\nelse:\n    print(\"possible\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking if it's possible for Alice, Bob, and Clara to pick some items such that no item on the menu is picked by everyone. This means the total number of items picked by all three of them should not exceed the total number of items on the menu. If it is, then it's impossible for no item to be picked by everyone. So, we just need to check if the sum of the items picked by Alice, Bob, and Clara is less than or equal to the total number of items on the menu. If it is, we print \"possible\", otherwise we print \"impossible\".\n\nThis is a simple condition check problem.\n\nNOTE: The problem statement does not specify that the items picked by Alice, Bob, and Clara should be distinct, i.e., they can pick the same item multiple times.\n\nIf you want to ensure", "m, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif a + b + c > m:\n    print(\"impossible\")\nelse:\n    print(\"possible\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nIn this problem, we are given the total number of items on the menu `m` and the number of items picked by Alice `a`, Bob `b`, and Clara `c`. We need to check if it's possible for them to pick some items such that no item on the menu is picked by everyone.\n\nThe solution is straightforward. If the total number of items picked by Alice, Bob, and Clara is greater than the total number of items on the menu, it's impossible for them to pick items such that no item is picked by everyone, so we print \"impossible\". Otherwise, we print \"possible\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be valid and doesn't handle any possible errors.", "m, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif a + b + c > m:\n    print(\"impossible\")\nelse:\n    print(\"possible\")\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input and checking if the sum of the items that Alice, Bob, and Clara are picking is greater than the total number of items on the menu. If this is true, then it's impossible for all items to be picked by everyone, so the program prints \"impossible\". Otherwise, the program prints \"possible\"."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAlice, Bob, and Clara are eating at a new restaurant today. They\u2019re having trouble deciding what to order, so Alice proposes that they each pick some items from the menu, and then they will order the items that everyone picked. The menu has $m$ items, and Alice, Bob, and Clara will order $a$, $b$, and $c$ items respectively. Is it possible for them to pick some items such that no item is picked by everyone?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single line with four integers, $m$, $a$, $b$, $c$, where $1\\leq m\\leq 100,000$, and $1\\leq a, b, c\\leq m$.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it\u2019s possible for Alice, Bob, and Clara to pick some item such that no item on the menu is picked by everyone, print \u201cpossible\u201d (without quotes). Otherwise, print \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6 2 2 2\nSample Output:\npossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
