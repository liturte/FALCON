If they are, the count is incremented. The minimum of the count and the length of the string is returned as the maximum `k`.\n\nThis is an efficient solution because it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop, where `n` is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the storage of the", "def max_k(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    k = 1\n    while k <= n // 2:\n        if s[:k] == s[-k:]:\n            k += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return k - 1\n\ns = input()\nprint(max_k(s))\n\n\nThis program works by checking each substring of length `k` from the start and end of the input string `s`, and incrementing `k` until it finds a pair of substrings that are not equal. When it finds a pair of substrings that are not equal, it breaks the loop and returns `k - 1` as the maximum value of `k`.\n\nThis solution works", "def max_palindrome_parts(s):\n    return max(min(i, (len(s)-1) // i) for i in range(1, int(s[::-1].index(max(s[i:] + [0], key=s[i:].count))) + 1))\n\nprint(max_palindrome_parts(input().strip()))\n\n\nThis solution works by first generating all possible values of `i` that can divide the length of the string `s`. It then finds the minimum value of `i` that satisfies the condition that the string can be divided into `i` parts. This minimum value is the largest value of `k` such that the string can be divided into `k` parts that form", "def solve(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    p = [0]*n\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = r = i\n        while r < n-1 and s[r+1] == s[l]:\n            r += 1\n        p[i] = r\n        while l > 0 and r < n-1 and s[l-1] == s[r+1]:\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n            p[i] = r\n    return max(p)\n\ns = input()\nprint(solve(s)+1)\n\n\nThis python code uses Manacher's Algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a", "def max_k(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    k = 1\n    while k <= n // 2:\n        if s[:k] == s[n - k:]:\n            k += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return k\n\ns = input()\nprint(max_k(s))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code works by iterating over the string `s` in reverse from the beginning, checking if the current substring is equal to the substring of `s` from the end. If they are equal, it increments `k` by 1, otherwise it breaks the loop. The function `max_k` returns the value of `k` at the end.

Find the maximal $k$ for which it is possible to partition $s$ into $k$ consecutive contiguous substrings, such that the $k$ parts form a palindrome. More precisely, we say that strings $s_0, s_1, \\dots , s_{k-1}$ form a palindrome if $s_ i = s_{k-1-i}$ for all $0\\leq i < k$.\n\nIn the first sample case, we can split the string 652526 into $4$ parts as 6|52|52|6, and these parts together form a palindrome. It turns out that it is impossible to split this input into more than $4$ parts while still making sure the parts form a palindrome.\n\n-----Input-----\n - A nonempty string of up to $10^6$ digits.\n\n-----Output-----\n - Print the maximal value of $k$ on a single line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n652526\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n12121131221\nSample Output 2:\n7\n\nSample Input 3:\n123456789\nSample Output 3:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
