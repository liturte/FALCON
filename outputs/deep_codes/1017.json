This is because each pair of 2 stones can be given to Masha as a present.

For example, if Artem gives Masha 3 stones first, she will receive them as a pair. Then, if Artem gives Masha 1 stone, she will receive it as a pair with the previous pair of stones.", "def max_presents(n):\n    return n // 2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_presents(n))\n\n\nThis Python code takes the number of stones Artem received as input and calculates the maximum possible number of times he can give presents to Masha. It does this by dividing the number of stones by 2 (since each pair of 2 stones can be given to Masha). The result is the maximum number of presents Artem can", "def max_presents(n):\n    return n//2 + 1 if n%2 else n//2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_presents(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the fact that Masha will remember the last present she received. This means that if Artem gives Masha an even number of stones, she will remember them. If Artem gives Masha an odd number of stones, she will not remember", "def max_presents(n):\n    return n//2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_presents(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a simple mathematical problem. The number of times Artem can give presents to Masha is the number of stones he has divided by 2. This is because Masha will remember the last present she received, so Artem can't give her the same number of stones twice in a row."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLittle Artem got n stones on his birthday and now wants to give some of them to Masha. He knows that Masha cares more about the fact of receiving the present, rather than the value of that present, so he wants to give her stones as many times as possible. However, Masha remembers the last present she received, so Artem can't give her the same number of stones twice in a row. For example, he can give her 3 stones, then 1 stone, then again 3 stones, but he can't give her 3 stones and then again 3 stones right after that.\n\nHow many times can Artem give presents to Masha?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 number of stones Artem received on his birthday.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible number of times Artem can give presents to Masha.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Artem can only give 1 stone to Masha.\n\nIn the second sample, Atrem can give Masha 1 or 2 stones, though he can't give her 1 stone two times.\n\nIn the third sample, Atrem can first give Masha 2 stones, a then 1 more stone.\n\nIn the fourth sample, Atrem can first give Masha 1 stone, then 2 stones, and finally 1 stone again.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
