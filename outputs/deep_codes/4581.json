It then calculates the price by adding 700 yen for the ramen and 100 yen for each topping that is not included in `S` (represented by 'x'). The `count` method of a string is used to count the number of 'x' characters in `S`, and this count is multiplied by 100 to get the price of the toppings.

The price of a ramen with one topping is 700 + 100 = 800 yen, so the price of a ramen with n toppings is 700 + n * 100 yen. The `print` function is used to print the calculated price.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not include any error checking", "S = input()\ntoppings = S.count('x')\nprice = 700 + toppings * 100\nprint(price)\n\n\nThe solution is a Python code that reads the input string `S`. It counts the number of 'x' characters in `S`, which corresponds to the number of toppings. Then, it calculates the price of the ramen by adding 700 yen to the product of the number of toppings and 100 yen for each topping. Finally, it prints the price."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn \"Takahashi-ya\", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs 700 yen (the currency of Japan), plus 100 yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions).\nA customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.\nWrite a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is a string of length 3.\n - Each character in S is o or x.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the price of the bowl of ramen corresponding to S.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\noxo\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n900\n\nThe price of a ramen topped with two kinds of toppings, boiled egg and green onions, is 700 + 100 \\times 2 = 900 yen.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
