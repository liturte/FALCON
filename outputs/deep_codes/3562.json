You have, of course, been spending too much time participating in various programming contests and have not done much studying. Now you have $N$ subjects to study for, but only a limited amount of time before the final exams. You have to decide how much time to allocate to studying each subject, so that your average grade over all $N$ subjects is maximized. \n\nAs a seasoned programming contest competitor, you recognize immediately that you can determine the optimal allocation with a computer program. Of course, you have decided to ignore the amount of time you spend solving this problem (i.e.\u00a0procrastinating).\n\nYou have a total of $T$ hours that you can split among different subjects. For each subject $i$, the expected grade with $t$ hours of studying is given by the function $f_ i(t) = a_ i t^2 + b_ i t + c_ i$, satisfying the following properties:\n - $f_ i(0) \\geq 0$;\n - $f_ i(T) \\leq 100$;\n - $a_ i < 0$;\n - $f_ i(t)$ is a non-decreasing function in the interval $[0,T]$.\n\nYou may allocate any fraction of an hour to a subject, not just whole hours. What is the maximum average grade you can obtain over all $n$ subjects?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of each input contains the integers $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\le 10$) and $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\le 240$) separated by a space. This is followed by $N$ lines, each containing the three parameters $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $c_ i$ describing the function $f_ i(t)$. The three parameters are separated by a space, and are given as real numbers with $4$ decimal places. Their absolute values are no more than $100$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput in a single line the maximum average grade you can obtain. Answers within $0.01$ of the correct answer will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 96\n-0.0080 1.5417 25.0000\n-0.0080 1.5417 25.0000\nSample Output:\n80.5696000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
