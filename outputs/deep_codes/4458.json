For each element in `p`, if it is greater than or equal to `max_val`, it increases `count` and updates `max_val`.

The final count is printed at the end.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the permutation, because it scans through the permutation once. The space complexity is O(N) because it needs to store the permutation.", "N = int(input())\nP = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmin_val = N + 1\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n    if P[i] < min_val:\n        count += 1\n        min_val = P[i]\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nIn this code, we first read the number N and the list of permutations P. We initialize two variables: `min_val` to the maximum possible value (N + 1) and `count` to 0. Then we iterate over the list P in reverse order. If the current element of P is less than `min_val`, we increment `count` and update `min_val` to the current element. Finally, we print the value of `count`.\n\nThis code runs in O(N) time, which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\nThe code assumes that the input", "N = int(input())\nP = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Initialize counter and maximum value seen so far\ncount = 0\nmax_val = 0\n\n# Iterate over the permutation\nfor i in range(N):\n    # If the current number is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far,\n    # increment the counter and update the maximum value\n    if P[i] >= max_val:\n        count += 1\n        max_val = P[i]\n\nprint(count)\n\nThis code works by iterating over the permutation and keeping track of the maximum value seen so far. If a number in the permutation is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far, it increments a counter and updates the maximum value.

When we encounter a number that is greater than the maximum, we increment our count and update the maximum.
