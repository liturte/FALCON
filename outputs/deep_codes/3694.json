Here is one of the optimal ways:\n\n  Firstly, Tokitsukaze can choose the first pile and take a stone from that pile.  Then, CSL can only choose the first pile, because if he chooses the second pile, he will lose immediately.  Finally, Tokitsukaze can choose the second pile, and then CSL will have no choice but to lose. \n\nIn the fourth example, they only have one good choice at any time, so Tokitsukaze can make the game lasting as long as possible and finally win.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
