We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of sum `j` using `i` numbers. We start by initializing `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` to 1 for all `i` and `j` (since there is exactly one way to get a sum of 0 using 0 numbers, and there is exactly one way to use 0 numbers to get a sum). Then we fill up the rest of the `dp` table by iterating over all possible sums `j` and all possible numbers of terms `i`. For each `j` and `i`, we add the number of sequences of sum `j` using `i-1` numbers (which is `dp[i-1][j]`) and the number of sequences of sum `j-1` using `i` numbers (which is", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\nS = int(input())\ndp = [[0]*(S+1) for _ in range(S+1)]\ndp[0][0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, S+1):\n    dp[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(1, S+1):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD\n        if j >= i:\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[i-1][j-i]) % MOD\nprint(dp[S][S])\n\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the number of sequences of length i and sum j. It then fills in the dp array using the recurrence relation dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-i] for all i and j. The final answer is dp[S][S] which represents the number of sequences of length S and sum S. The answer is taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(S^2) and the space complexity is O(S^2).", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\nS = int(input())\ndp = [[0] * (S + 1) for _ in range(S + 1)]\ndp[0][0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, S + 1):\n    dp[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(1, S + 1):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % MOD\nprint(dp[S][S])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp[i][j] represents the number of sequences with i terms and sum j. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, which represents no sequence and sum 0. Then for each term i, we add the number of sequences with i - 1 terms and sum j (dp[i - 1][j]) and the number of sequences with i terms and sum j - 1 (dp[i][j - 1]). The result is the number of sequences with S terms and sum S, which is dp[S][S]. The modulo operation is used to prevent overflow.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(S^2), and the space complexity is O(S^2), which is feasible for the given constraints.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the integers in the sequences are distinct.

It first initializes an array `dp` of size `S+1` to 0, where `dp[i]` represents the number of sequences whose sum is `i`. The base case is `dp[0] = 1` because there is one sequence with sum 0.\n\nThen, for each integer `i` from 3 to `S`, it updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i-3]` to it. It also does the same for integers `i` from 4 to `S` and integers `i` from 5 to `S`. This is done because each sequence can be extended by adding a 3, a 4, or a 5 to any sequence whose sum is `i-3"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is an integer S.\nFind how many sequences there are whose terms are all integers greater than or equal to 3, and whose sum is equal to S.\nThe answer can be very large, so output it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq S \\leq 2000\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n7\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\n3 sequences satisfy the condition: \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,3\\} and \\{7\\}.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
