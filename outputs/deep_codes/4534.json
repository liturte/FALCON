Then it iterates through the list, replacing each 0 with the sum of the number directly above it and the number above and to the left. The last line of the code returns the final list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(k) and the space complexity is also O(k) because it uses a list of size k to store the row.\n\nThe follow-up question asks to optimize the solution to use only O(k) space. The current solution already uses O(k) space as it generates the next row based on the current row. It does not use any additional space proportional to the input size.\n\nIf you want to follow up and solve it in O(1) space, you can use the formula nCr = nCr-1 * (rowIndex - r + 1) / r, where nCr is the element of the row and r is the current index. However, this formula will only give you the element at the given index, not the whole row.\n\nclass Solution:\n    def getRow(self", "class Solution:\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\n        row = [1] + [0]*rowIndex\n        for i in range(rowIndex):\n            row[rowIndex-i] = row[rowIndex-i] + row[rowIndex-i-1]\n        return row\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution starts by creating an array of size rowIndex+1 with the first element as 1 and rest as 0. Then it iteratively calculates each element of the row based on the sum of the two elements directly above it. The final row is then returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(k) and the space complexity is also O(k) because of the array used to store the row.\n\nThe use of only O(k) extra space is possible because the array is being used to store the result directly, and no new arrays are being created. The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThis solution is a direct implementation of the formula used to generate Pascal's triangle. The formula is based on the binomial coefficient formula, which is used to calculate the elements of the triangle. The formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n \u2211 k (k > 0)\n\nwhere n is the row index, k is the column index, and C(n, k) is the element of the Pascal's triangle.\n\nThe formula", "class Solution:\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\n        row = [1] + [0]*rowIndex\n        for i in range(rowIndex):\n            row[rowIndex-i] = row[rowIndex-i] + row[rowIndex-i-1]\n        return row\n\n\nThis solution uses a dynamic programming approach. It starts by initializing a list with one 1 at the beginning and rowIndex number of 0s. Then it iterates over the list, and at each index, it sets the value to be the sum of the current index and the next index. This will effectively calculate the row of the Pascal's triangle at each step. Finally, it returns the row.\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(k) because it uses a list of length k to store the row. The time complexity is also O(k) because it iterates over the list k times.\n\nThis solution satisfies the follow-up requirement of using only O(k) extra space.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If the input is not guaranteed to be a non-negative integer, additional error checking should be added.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the row index starts from 0.

It then calculates the row values in-place, starting from the end (as we are calculating values of the next row based on the current row). Finally, it returns the row.\n\nThe time complexity is O(k) and the space complexity is O(k) as well, as we are using an array of size k to store the row values.\n\nThis solution is not using any extra space apart from the input and output, so it meets the follow-up requirement.", "class Solution:\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\n        row = [1] + [0]*rowIndex\n        for i in range(rowIndex):\n            row[rowIndex-i] = row[rowIndex-i] + row[rowIndex-i-1]\n        return row[:rowIndex+1]\n\n\nThis code creates a list with one '1' at the beginning and 'rowIndex' zeros.
