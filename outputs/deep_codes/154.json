The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.\n\nThe depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is $0$.\n\nLet's call a binary search tree perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.\n\nLet's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex $v$:   If $v$ has a left subtree whose root is $u$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is different from the parity of the key of $u$.  If $v$ has a right subtree whose root is $w$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is the same as the parity of the key of $w$. \n\nYou are given a single integer $n$. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices that have distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive. Output this number modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$), denoting the required number of vertices.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices and distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, this is the only tree that satisfies the conditions: $\\left. \\begin{array}{l}{\\text{perfectly balanced}} \\\\{\\text{striped}} \\\\{\\text{binary search tree}} \\end{array} \\right.$\n\nIn the second example, here are various trees that don't satisfy some condition: [Image]\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
