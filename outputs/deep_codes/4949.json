Mirko soon noticed that not all of the matches on the floor fit in the box, so he decided to take the matches that don\u2019t fit and throw them in the neighbour\u2019s garbage, where his mom (hopefully) won\u2019t find them.\n\nHelp Mirko determine which of the matches fit in the box his mom gave him. A match fits in the box if its entire length can lie on the bottom of the box. Mirko examines the matches one by one.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50$), the number of matches on the floor, and two integers $W$ and $H$, the dimensions of the box ($1 \\leq W \\leq 100$, $1 \\leq H \\leq 100$).\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains a single integer between $1$ and $1000$ (inclusive), the length of one match.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each match, in the order they were given in the input, output on a separate line \u201cDA\u201d if the match fits in the box or \u201cNE\u201d if it does not.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 3 4\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nSample Output:\nDA\nDA\nDA\nNE\nNE\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
