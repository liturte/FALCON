The number is given without leading zeroes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $n$, print -1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8314\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n625\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n333\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we should delete from $8314$ the digits $3$ and $4$. After that $8314$ become equals to $81$, which is the square of the integer $9$.\n\nIn the second example the given $625$ is the square of the integer $25$, so you should not delete anything. \n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make the square from $333$, so the answer is -1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
