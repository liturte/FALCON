The answer to each assignment is a string, where the $i^\\textrm {th}$ letter represents the answer to the $i^\\textrm {th}$ question.\n\nBut instead of handing in two strings, Anthony only hands in a single string. He claims he answered every question correctly but his little sister Cora merged his two strings into a single string. Moreover, Cora merged his string in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:\n - For any two integers $0\\leq i<j<|s_1|$ (where $|s_1|$ is the length of $s_1$), the index of $s_1[i]$ in $s$ is less than the index of $s_1[j]$ in $s$\n - For any two integers $0\\leq i<j<|s_2|$, the index of $s_2[i]$ in $s$ is less than the index of $s_2[j]$ in $s$\n\nCan you help Anthony\u2019s teacher verify whether Anthony\u2019s claim is possible?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single string $s$. It is guaranteed that $2\\leq |s|\\leq 10000$.\n\nThe next two lines contain strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ respectively. It is guaranteed that $1\\leq |s_1|, |s_2|\\leq 5000$ and $|s_1|+|s_2|=|s|$.\n\nAll the strings consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Anthony\u2019s claim is possible, print \u201cyes\u201d (without quotes). Otherwise, print \u201cno\u201d (without quotes).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\naabcad\naba\nacd\nSample Output:\nyes\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
