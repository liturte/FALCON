House 18 is guarded by two dogs that often cause problems. What they don\u2019t know is that the dogs\u2019 behaviour is completely predictable.\n\nWhen the day starts, one dog is aggressive for $A$ minutes and is then calm for $B$ minutes. Similarly, the other dog is aggressive for $C$ minutes, then calm for $D$ minutes. Both dogs repeat their behaviours indefinitely, starting a new aggressive period after the calm period, then another calm period etc.\n\nGiven the arrival times of the postman, milkman and garbage man, determine how many dogs (none, one or both) attack each of them.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$.\n\nThe second line contains the integer $P$, $M$ and $G$, the minute in the day during which the postman, milkman and garbage man arrive at house 18. For example, if $P$ is 3, it should be interpreted as \"the postman arrived sometime during the third minute in the day\".\n\nAll numbers in the input will be between 1 and 999.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should consist of three lines; each containing \u2019both\u2019, \u2019one\u2019 or \u2019none\u2019, depending on how many dogs attack each of our heroes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 2 3 3\n1 3 4\nSample Output:\nboth\none\nnone\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
