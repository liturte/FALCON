Some of the characters have become smudged and illegible, and could have been any character.\n\nWrite a program that calculates how many ways the illegible characters in the string can be replaced by brackets so that the result is a regular bracket-sequence. This number can be very large, so output only its last $5$ digits.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an even integer $N$ ($2 \\le N \\le 200$), the length of the string. The second line contains the string. Illegible characters are represented by the \u2018?\u2019 character.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of regular bracket-sequences the string could have read.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6\n()()()\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n10\n(?([?)]?}?\nSample Output 2:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
