All numbers in the array are either between $1$ and $k$ (inclusive), or equal to $-1$. The array is good if there is no segment of $len$ consecutive equal numbers.\n\nVasya will replace each $-1$ with some number from $1$ to $k$ (inclusive) in such a way that the resulting array is good. Tell him the number of ways to do this replacement. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n, k$ and $len$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 100, 1 \\le len \\le n$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ numbers \u2014 the array. Each number is either $-1$ or between $1$ and $k$ (inclusive).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of ways to replace each $-1$ with some number from $1$ to $k$ (inclusive) so the array is good. The answer may be large, so print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 3\n1 -1 1 -1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n6 3 2\n1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n10 42 7\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\nOutput\n645711643\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nPossible answers in the first test:   $[1, 2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 2, 1, 2, 2]$. \n\nThere is no way to make the array good in the second test, since first two elements are equal.\n\nThere are too many answers in the third test, so we won't describe any of them.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
