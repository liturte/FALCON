The player who ends with the most points wins. One winning strategy is to focus on building scientific structures. There are three types of scientific structure cards: Tablet (\u2018T\u2019), Compass (\u2018C\u2019), and Gear (\u2018G\u2019). For each type of cards, a player earns a number of points that is equal to the squared number of that type of cards played. Additionally, for each set of three different scientific cards, a player scores $7$ points. \n\nFor example, if a player plays $3$ Tablet cards, $2$ Compass cards and $1$ Gear card, she gets $3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 7 = 21$ points.\n\nIt might be tedious to calculate how many scientific points a player gets by the end of each game. Therefore, you are here to help write a program for the calculation to save everyone\u2019s time.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input has a single string with no more than $50$ characters. The string contains only letters \u2018T\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 or \u2018G\u2019, which denote the scientific cards a player has played in a Seven Wonders game.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of scientific points the player earns.\n\n-----Note-----\nSeven Wonders was created by Antoine Bauza, and published by Repos Production. Antoine Bauza and Repos Production do not endorse and have no involvement with the ProgNova contest.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nTCGTTC\nSample Output 1:\n21\n\nSample Input 2:\nCCC\nSample Output 2:\n9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
