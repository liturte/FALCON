If a number is divisible by k and greater than y, it adds the difference between the number and y to the list x.

If n is less than y, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the range of possible values for x (from (n-y)//k+1 to (n+k-1)//k) and prints these values.

Then, it creates a list of all possible values of x that satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement. This is done by generating all numbers i from 1 to n // k (inclusive), and checking if i * k + y is less than or equal to n. If this is the case, i * k is added to the list.

For each number x, it checks if x is greater than or equal to y, and if the sum of x and y is divisible by k. If both conditions are met, it adds x to the list of possible values. Finally, it prints the list of values or -1 if the list is empty.", "y, k, n = map(int, input().split())\n\npotatoes = []\nfor x in range(k, n+1, k):\n    if x != y:\n        potatoes.append(x)\n\nif potatoes:\n    print(*potatoes)\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating over every number from k to n in steps of k. For each number, it checks if it is not equal to y (the number of potatoes in the second bag), and if it is, it adds it to the list of potential numbers for the first bag.

Valera \u2014 very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.\n\nHelp Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 \u2264 y, k, n \u2264 10^9; $\\frac{n}{k}$  \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the list of whitespace-separated integers \u2014 all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.\n\nIf there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 1 10\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n10 6 40\n\nOutput\n2 8 14 20 26\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
