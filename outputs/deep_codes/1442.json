The order number i has price p_{i}, direction d_{i} \u2014 buy or sell, and integer q_{i}. This means that the participant is ready to buy or sell q_{i} stocks at price p_{i} for one stock. A value q_{i} is also known as a volume of an order.\n\nAll orders with the same price p and direction d are merged into one aggregated order with price p and direction d. The volume of such order is a sum of volumes of the initial orders.\n\nAn order book is a list of aggregated orders, the first part of which contains sell orders sorted by price in descending order, the second contains buy orders also sorted by price in descending order.\n\nAn order book of depth s contains s best aggregated orders for each direction. A buy order is better if it has higher price and a sell order is better if it has lower price.
