It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the cars by iterating over each car and checking if it can be moved to its correct position. The number of moves is the maximum of the current car's position and its index plus one.

For each car, it checks if there is a car to its left that is larger (has a larger number) than the current car.

David Blaine wants to sort the railway cars in the order of increasing numbers. In one move he can make one of the cars disappear from its place and teleport it either to the beginning of the train, or to the end of the train, at his desire. What is the minimum number of actions David Blaine needs to perform in order to sort the train?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cars in the train. \n\nThe second line contains n integers p_{i} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n, p_{i} \u2260 p_{j} if i \u2260 j)\u00a0\u2014 the sequence of the numbers of the cars in the train.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of actions needed to sort the railway cars.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 1 2 5 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n4 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample you need first to teleport the 4-th car, and then the 5-th car to the end of the train.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
