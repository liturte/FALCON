They want to travel from the old city of A-town to the popular summer resort B-ville, but they haven\u2019t yet decided which other places to visit en route. There are $N$ places to visit in total, numbered from $1$ to\u00a0$N$. A-town is place number\u00a0$1$ and B-ville is place number\u00a0$N$. Some places are linked by one-directional connections; a pair of places can be linked by multiple such connections.\n\nAlice and Bob are currently in A-town. Each day they will decide where to travel next by choosing uniformly at random among the connections leaving their current place. Once they reach B-ville, they stop.\n\nAlice and Bob want to book their trip back on a day where they are in B-ville with $95\\% $ probability. And they really mean exactly$95\\% $ \u2013 no more, no less! There is a $10$ day window when train tickets are affordable; if their return trip does no occur within that window they might as well cancel the entire vacation.\n\nYou are given a positive integer $L$ and have to find a number $T$ with $L \\leq T \\leq L + 9$ such that the probability of Alice and Bob being in B-ville after $T$ days is exactly $95\\% $. If there is more than one valid $T$, report smallest one.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $N$ and $L$, with $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$ and $1 \\leq L \\leq 10^6$. The following $N$ lines each contain $N$ integers. The $j$th integer on the $i$th line contains the number $a_{ij}$ of one-directional connections from place $i$ to place $j$, where $0 \\leq a_{ij} \\leq 10^9$.\n\nThere are no connections from a place to itself. No connections leave B-ville (the $N$th place). All other places have at least one outgoing connection, so Alice and Bob will never be stuck.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the integer $T$ as described above.
