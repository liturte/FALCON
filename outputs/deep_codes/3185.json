The input is taken as the factorial of a number `n` and the output is the number `n` itself.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work for large inputs as the factorial of a number grows extremely fast. For such cases, you might need to use a more advanced algorithm or a library that can handle large numbers.\n\nAlso, the factorial of a number grows very quickly, even for relatively small numbers. So, the number of digits in the factorial of a number can be very large. As such, the maximum input size is set to $10^{6}$, but this is still a very large number.\n\nIf you need to calculate the factorial of a very large number, you might need to use a library that can handle large numbers, such as the `mp", "import math\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(math.factorial(n))\n\n\nThis program uses the built-in `factorial` function from the `math` module to calculate the factorial of the input number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of the number and returns it.\n\nThis program reads the input number from the user, calculates the factorial of the number, and then prints the result.\n\nPlease note that this program uses the `math.factorial` function which is not the best approach to solve this problem. This function calculates the factorial of a number by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to the number which can be computationally expensive for large numbers. A better approach would be to use the property of factorial that n!/((n-r)!) = n!/r to calculate the factorial in a more efficient way.\n\nHere is an", "import math\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nfactorial = math.factorial(n)\nprint(factorial)\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `math.factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a number. The input number is taken as user input and passed to this function to get the factorial. The factorial is then printed as output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input number is the actual number you want to find the factorial of, not the number of digits of the factorial. If you want to find the number of digits of a factorial, you would need to use a different approach.\n\nPlease note that the maximum value for `math.factorial` is `170` because `171!--` overflows the maximum value of a Python `long`.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the factorial function grows very fast, so even for relatively small input numbers, the result can have millions of digits. For example,", "import math\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\ndef find_n(fact):\n    n = 0\n    while factorial(n) <= fact:\n        n += 1\n    return n - 1\n\nfact = int(input().strip())\nprint(find_n(fact))\n\n\nThis code uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. The `find_n` function iterates from 0 to `n` until it finds a number whose factorial is greater than the given number. The result is the number `n` minus 1, because the last iteration will exceed the given number.\n\nNote that this code is not efficient for large inputs because it uses a recursive function and it doesn't take into account the fact that the factorial of a number grows very fast. A more efficient solution would use an iterative approach with a", "import math\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\ndef find_n(fact):\n    n = 0\n    while factorial(n) <= fact:\n        n += 1\n    return n - 1\n\nfact = int(input().strip())\nprint(find_n(fact))\n\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. The function `find_n` iteratively increments a counter `n` until `n`'s factorial is greater than the input `fact`. The function then returns `n - 1`, as `n` is incremented one extra time at the end of the loop.\n\nThis solution is not efficient for large input because the factorial of a number grows very fast.

In this problem, however, your task is reversed. You are given the value of $n!$ and you have to find the value of $n$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains the factorial $n!$ of a positive integer $n$.
