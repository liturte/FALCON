It involves numbers n, k and a sequence of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.\n\nHowever I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2200). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^4).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one number.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 5\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n10 3\n16 8 2 4 512 256 32 128 64 1\n\nOutput\n7\nInput\n5 1\n20 10 50 30 46\n\nOutput\n10\nInput\n6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nOutput\n36\nInput\n1 1\n100\n\nOutput\n100\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
