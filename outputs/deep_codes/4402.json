It then checks if Takahashi is 13 years old or older. If so, it prints the cost of the Ferris wheel. If not, it checks if Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old. If so, it prints half the cost of the Ferris wheel.

The age of Takahashi is given as an input. If the age is 13 or more, the cost is printed as it is. If the age is between", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A >= 13:\n    print(B)\nelif 6 <= A <= 12:\n    print(B // 2)\nelse:\n    print(0)\n\n\nThe code first reads the input and checks if Takahashi's age (A) is 13 or older. If so, it prints the full cost of the Ferris wheel (B). If Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old, it prints half the cost. If Takahashi is 5 years old or younger, it prints 0, as he is free.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be valid according to the constraints.\n\nNote: The '//' operator is used for integer division in Python, which means it will always round down to the nearest whole number. For example, 5 // 2 would be 2, because 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, but 2 // 2 would be 1,", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A < 6:\n    print(0)\nelif 6 <= A <= 12:\n    print(B // 2)\nelse:\n    print(B)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find the cost of the Ferris wheel for Takahashi. \n\nIf Takahashi is 5 years old or younger, he is free of charge. So, if A is less than 6, the cost is 0.\n\nIf Takahashi is between 6 and 12 years old, he can ride it for half the cost. So, if 6 <= A <= 12, the cost is B // 2.\n\nIf Takahashi is 13 years old or older, he can ride it for the full cost. So, if A is greater than 12, the cost is B.\n\nThe input A and B are read from the standard input and split into two variables A and B."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi, who is A years old, is riding a Ferris wheel.\nIt costs B yen (B is an even number) to ride the Ferris wheel if you are 13 years old or older, but children between 6 and 12 years old (inclusive) can ride it for half the cost, and children who are 5 years old or younger are free of charge.
