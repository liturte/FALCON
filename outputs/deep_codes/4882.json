When you need to make a major home repair, you often need to hire someone to help. When they come for the first visit, they make an estimate of the cost. Here they must be careful: if they overestimate the cost, it might scare you off, but if they underestimate, the work might not be worth their time.\n\nBecause the worker is so careful, it can take a long time for them to produce the estimate. But that\u2019s frustrating \u2014 when you ask for an estimate, you really are asking for the magnitude of the cost. Will this be $$10$ or $$100$ or $$1000$? That\u2019s all you really want to know on a first visit.\n\nPlease help the worker make the type of estimate you desire. Write a program that, given the worker\u2019s estimate, reports just the magnitude of the cost \u2014 the number of digits needed to represent the estimate.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput begins with a line containing an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100$). The next $N$ lines each contain one estimated cost, which is an integer between $0$ and $10^{100}$. (Some of the workers overcharge quite a bit.)\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each estimated cost, output the number of digits required to represent it.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\n314\n1\n5926\n5\n35897\nSample Output:\n3\n1\n4\n1\n5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
