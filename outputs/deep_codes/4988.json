The recursion is used to multiply each number from the input number down to 1, and the result is taken modulus 10 to get the last digit. The results are printed for each test case.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle very large inputs as the factorial of a number can grow very large. The modulus operator is used to only keep the last digit of the factorial, which allows the code to handle inputs up to 10 without running into memory or processing issues.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the input is correct and does not include any error checking or validation.", "import math\n\ndef factorial_last_digit(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return (n * factorial_last_digit(n - 1)) % 10\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    print(factorial_last_digit(N))\n\n\nThis code uses a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number. The function multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one, until it reaches zero. The result is then taken modulo 10 to get the last digit. This is done because the last digit of the product of two numbers is the same as the last digit of the product of the last digits of the two numbers. This property is used to compute the last digit of the factorial in a more efficient way. The code then reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number and prints the last digit of its factorial.\n\nPlease note that this code uses recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.

If `n` is `0`, it returns `1` (since `0` factorial is `1`). Otherwise, it returns the product of `n` and the last digit of the factorial of `n - 1`, modulo `10` (to get the last digit). This is done by using the modulo operator `%`, which gives the remainder of the division of the two numbers.\n\nThe main part of the code reads the number of test cases `T` from the input, and for each test case, it reads the number `N` from the input, and prints the last digit of `N` factorial.", "def factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    fact = str(factorial(N))\n    print(int(fact[-1]))\n\n\nThis code defines a recursive function `factorial(n)` to calculate the factorial of a number `n`. It then reads the number of test cases `T` from input, and for each test case, it reads the number `N`, calculates `N` factorial, converts it to a string, and prints the last digit of the string (which is also the last digit of `N` factorial).\n\nNote: This code uses Python's recursion to calculate the factorial, which may lead to a stack overflow for large `N`. If you're dealing with large `N`, you may need to use an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.\n\nHere is the iterative approach:\n\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result *", "def last_digit_factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return (n * last_digit_factorial(n - 1)) % 10\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    print(last_digit_factorial(N))\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number and then uses the modulus operator to get the last digit. The base case of the recursion is when n is 0, in which case the function returns 1. For all other cases, the function returns the product of n and the factorial of n - 1, modulo 10, which gives the last digit of the product. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of N and prints the last digit of N's factorial."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe factorial of $N$, written as $N!$, is defined as the product of all the integers from $1$ to $N$. For example, $3! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nThis number can be very large, so instead of computing the entire product, just compute the last digit of $N!$ (when $N!$ is written in base\u00a0$10$).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$, the number of test cases.
