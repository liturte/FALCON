It uses the built-in `input` function to read the integers and the character, and the `int` function to convert the inputs to integers. The result of the operation is printed using the `print` function.", "A = input().strip()\nop = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nif op == '+':\n    print(str(int(A) + int(B)))\nelse:\n    print(str(int(A) * int(B)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads three lines from the standard input. The first line is the first operand A, the second line is the operation op, and the third line is the second operand B. It then calculates the result of the operation by converting the operands to integers and performing the operation. Finally, it prints", "A = int(input())\nop = input()\nB = int(input())\n\nif op == '+':\n    print(A+B)\nelse:\n    print(A*B)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis python program takes in three inputs from the user: two numbers and an operator. It then performs the operation specified by the operator on the two numbers and prints the result.\n\nThe operator is a string, so we use an if-else statement to check if the operator is '+' or '*'. If it's '+', we add the two numbers together. If it"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nQuite often there is substantial noise in the classroom during class. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher is saying, the students rather discuss the economic crisis or Croatia\u2019s joining the European Union.\n\nThe biggest noise often occurs when the students are idle, so teachers will give them tasks with a lot of work to calm them down. In one type of such task, the student must calculate the result of an arithmetic operation on two large numbers.\n\nThe arithmetic operations we will consider are adding and multiplication. The operands will be powers of $10$ with no more than $100$ digits.\n\nWrite a program that calculates the result of the operation.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a positive integer $A$, the first operand.\n\nThe second line either the character \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018*\u2019, representing addition or multiplication.\n\nThe third line contains a positive integer $B$, the second operand.\n\nThe integers $A$ and $B$ will be powers of $10$ and consist of at most $100$ digits.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the result of the operation.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1000\n*\n100\nSample Output 1:\n100000\n\nSample Input 2:\n10000\n+\n10\nSample Output 2:\n10010\n\nSample Input 3:\n10\n+\n1000\nSample Output 3:\n1010\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
