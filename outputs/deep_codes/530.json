But the game is for three, so when Roman doesn't show up, Yaroslav and Andrey play another game. \n\nRoman leaves a word for each of them. Each word consists of 2\u00b7n binary characters \"0\" or \"1\". After that the players start moving in turns. Yaroslav moves first. During a move, a player must choose an integer from 1 to 2\u00b7n, which hasn't been chosen by anybody up to that moment. Then the player takes a piece of paper and writes out the corresponding character from his string. \n\nLet's represent Yaroslav's word as s = s_1s_2... s_2n. Similarly, let's represent Andrey's word as t = t_1t_2... t_2n. Then, if Yaroslav choose number k during his move, then he is going to write out character s_{k} on the piece of paper. Similarly, if Andrey choose number r during his move, then he is going to write out character t_{r} on the piece of paper.\n\nThe game finishes when no player can make a move. After the game is over, Yaroslav makes some integer from the characters written on his piece of paper (Yaroslav can arrange these characters as he wants). Andrey does the same. The resulting numbers can contain leading zeroes. The person with the largest number wins. If the numbers are equal, the game ends with a draw.\n\nYou are given two strings s and t.
