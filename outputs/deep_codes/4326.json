{"4326": {"code": ["N = int(input())\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nThis code reads the number of students from the input, then divides that number by 3 (using integer division to get a whole number of groups) and prints the result.\n\nThis is because you can form a group of three students by dividing the total number of students by 3. If there are 3 students left over, you can form an additional group of three students. If there are 2 students left over, you can form an additional group of three students by adding one more student to the group of three students. So, the maximum number of groups of three or more students you can form is the number of students divided by 3, rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n\nThis solution works because the groups of three or more students can be formed by grouping the remaining students after the initial groups of three students have been formed. This means that the number of students left over after forming the initial groups is not a concern when determining the maximum number of groups of three or more students.\n\nThis solution also works for all input values of N from 1 to 1000, as required by the problem constraints.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a simple mathematical operation to determine the maximum number of groups of three or more students, which takes constant time.\n\nThis solution is correct because", "N = int(input())\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nExplanation:\nEach group of three students can effectively discuss a theme.\nSo, the number of groups consisting of three or more students is the total number of students divided by 3.\nThe \"//\" operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part.\n\nThis solution assumes that all students can effectively discuss a theme.\nIf some students cannot discuss a theme, the number of groups consisting of three or more students may be less than N // 3.\nHowever, the problem statement states that \"you think that groups consisting of two or less students cannot have an effective discussion\",\nso we can be sure that all students can discuss a theme if N is a multiple of 3.\n'''\n\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nExplanation:\nEach group of three students can effectively discuss a theme.\nSo, the number of groups consisting of three or more students is the total number of students divided by 3.\nThe \"//\" operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part.\n\nThis solution assumes that all students can effectively discuss a theme.\nIf some students cannot discuss a theme, the number of groups consisting of three or more students may be", "N = int(input())\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSince each group of three students can effectively discuss a theme, the maximum number of groups that can be formed is the total number of students divided by 3. This is because each group of three students can discuss a theme, and each student can participate in discussions with two other students. So, to maximize the number of groups consisting of three or more students, you should divide the number of students as evenly as possible among the groups of three.\n\nIn the given sample input of 8 students, the maximum number of groups consisting of three or more students is 8 // 3 = 2. So, the output is 2.\n\nThe \"//\" operator is used to perform integer division in Python, which discards the fractional part and returns only the integer part of the division.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that each group of three students can effectively discuss a theme. If this is not the case, the solution may not work.\n\nAlso, this solution does not take into account the possibility of groups consisting of two students. If you want to include groups consisting of two students, you would need to modify the solution to check if there are any remaining students after forming groups of three.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the number of students is a multiple of 3. If the number", "N = int(input())\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn this problem, we can maximize the number of groups consisting of three or more students by dividing the total number of students into groups of three. This is because a group of three students can have an effective discussion.\n\nWe can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of students by 3. The '//' operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient.\n\nThe 'input()' function is used to read the total number of students from the standard input. The 'int()' function is used to convert the input to an integer.\n\nThe 'print()' function is used to output the maximum number of groups consisting of three or more students.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it takes constant time to run regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThe space complexity is also O(1), which means it uses constant space to store the input and output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the number of students is a multiple of 3. If it's not, then some students will be left out of a group.\n\nThis solution assumes that the number of students is a positive integer. If it's zero or negative, then the program will crash.", "N = int(input())\nprint(N // 3)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program takes the number of students as input, and then divides it by 3. The result is the maximum number of groups consisting of three or more students. This is because each group consists of 3 or more students, so we can get as many groups as we can by dividing the total number of students by 3. If the number of students is not a multiple of 3, some students will be left out, but this is not a problem because we can always add them to the next group.\n\nThis solution works because the number of groups is maximized when the number of students is as large as possible. This is because each group consists of 3 or more students, so we can get as many groups as we can by dividing the total number of students by 3.\n\nThis program uses the integer division operator (//) to divide the number of students by 3 and get the quotient. The remainder of the division is not used because it can't be included in any group.\n\nThis program is efficient because it performs a single division operation. The time complexity is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.\n\nThis program is correct because it correctly maxim"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are N students in a school.\nWe will divide these students into some groups, and in each group they will discuss some themes.\nYou think that groups consisting of two or less students cannot have an effective discussion, so you want to have as many groups consisting of three or more students as possible.\nDivide the students so that the number of groups consisting of three or more students is maximized.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 1000\n - All input values are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nIf you can form at most x groups consisting of three or more students, print x.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nFor example, you can form a group of three students and another of five students.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
