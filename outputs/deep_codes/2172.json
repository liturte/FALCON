You come up with the following plan to keep up with his lecture and make notes.\n\nYou know two languages, and the professor is giving the lecture in the first one. The words in both languages consist of lowercase English characters, each language consists of several words. For each language, all words are distinct, i.e. they are spelled differently. Moreover, the words of these languages have a one-to-one correspondence, that is, for each word in each language, there exists exactly one word in the other language having has the same meaning.\n\nYou can write down every word the professor says in either the first language or the second language. Of course, during the lecture you write down each word in the language in which the word is shorter. In case of equal lengths of the corresponding words you prefer the word of the first language.\n\nYou are given the text of the lecture the professor is going to read.
