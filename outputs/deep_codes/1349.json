If we turn it on, then after 1 second passes, only bed 3 will be watered; after 2 seconds pass, beds [1, 3] will be watered, and after 3 seconds pass, everything will be watered.  There are 3 garden beds, and there is a water tap in each one. If we turn all of them on, then everything will be watered after 1 second passes.  There are 4 garden beds, and only one tap in the bed 1. It will take 4 seconds to water, for example, bed 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
