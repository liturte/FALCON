He wants to construct his favourite number t. He realized that digits 6 and 9 are very similar, so he can rotate piece of ice with 6 to use as 9 (and vice versa). Similary, 2 and 5 work the same. There is no other pair of digits with similar effect. He called this effect \"Digital Mimicry\".\n\nSheldon favourite number is t. He wants to have as many instances of t as possible. How many instances he can construct using the given sequence of ice pieces. He can use any piece at most once. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000). The second line contains the sequence of digits on the pieces. The length of line is equal to the number of pieces and between 1 and 200, inclusive. It contains digits between 0 and 9.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the required number of instances.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n42\n23454\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n169\n12118999\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThis problem contains very weak pretests.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
