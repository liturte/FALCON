The `*` operator is used to unpack the range into the `print` function, which prints all the coordinates separated by spaces.", "K, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(max(0, X-K+1), X+K))))\n\n\nThis solution first reads the input values for K and X. Then it prints a string of space-separated numbers from the maximum of 0 and X-K+1 to X+K. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from the start to the stop value, not including the stop value.

The coordinates of these stones are -1000000, -999999, -999998, \\ldots, 999999, 1000000.\nAmong them, some K consecutive stones are painted black, and the others are painted white.\nAdditionally, we know that the stone at coordinate X is painted black.\nPrint all coordinates that potentially contain a stone painted black, in ascending order.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 100\n - 0 \\leq X \\leq 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nK X\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint all coordinates that potentially contain a stone painted black, in ascending order, with spaces in between.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 7\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWe know that there are three stones painted black, and the stone at coordinate 7 is painted black. There are three possible cases:\n - The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 5, 6, and 7.\n - The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 6, 7, and 8.\n - The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 7, 8, and 9.\nThus, five coordinates potentially contain a stone painted black: 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
