The elements of the array have to be sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 2 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8\n11 12 1 2 13 14 3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n7 6 5 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the array is already sorted, so no finger snaps are required.\n\nIn the second example the array actually has a subarray of 4 sorted elements, but you can not remove elements from different sides of the array in one finger snap. Each time you have to remove either the whole first half or the whole second half, so you'll have to snap your fingers twice to get to a 2-element sorted array.\n\nIn the third example the array is sorted in decreasing order, so you can only save one element from the ultimate destruction.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
