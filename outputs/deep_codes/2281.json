It then sorts `a` in descending order. Next, it creates an array `b` of size 2n with the first half filled with the first n elements of `a` and the second half filled with the last n elements of `a` in reverse order. Finally, it prints the elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\nThis solution works because it minimizes the sum `s` by placing the larger numbers at the beginning of the array and the smaller numbers at the end", "def solve(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1, 1]\n    else:\n        a = list(range(1, n+1))\n        b = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        return a + b\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, solve(int(input())))))\n\n\nThis solution works by creating two lists: a with numbers from 1 to n and b with numbers from n down to 1. It then concatenates these two lists together to create the final permutation. The sum s is minimized by placing the larger numbers at the end of the list, as this minimizes the impact of the subtraction in the sum.", "def solve(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1, 1]\n    res = [0] * (2*n)\n    res[::2] = list(range(1, n+1)) + list(range(n, 0, -1))\n    res[1::2] = list(range(n+1, 2*n+1)) + list(range(n, 0, -1))\n    return res\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, solve(int(input())))))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is asking to rearrange the array so that the sum of the differences between the original position and the new position (multiplied by the index) is minimized. The solution is to make the elements in the first half of the array be in ascending order, and the elements in the second half of the array be in descending order. This way, the sum of the differences will be minimized.\n\nThis code first checks if n is 1. If it is, it returns [1, 1] since there's no need to", "def solve(n):\n    a = list(range(1, n+1)) + list(range(1, n+1))\n    b = list(range(n, 2*n)) + list(range(1, n))\n    return b\n\nprint(*solve(2))\nprint(*solve(1))\n\nThis solution works by creating two lists, a and b. List a contains the numbers from 1 to n twice, while list b contains the numbers from n to 2n, followed by the numbers from 1 to n-1. This way, the sum d_i + i - n in the minimum sum s is maximized for each i, which is the desired permutation.", "def solve(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1, 1]\n    else:\n        a = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]\n        b = [i for i in range(n, 2*n)]\n        c = [i for i in range(n+1, 2*n+1)]\n        d = [i for i in range(2*n, 2*n+n, 2)]\n        e = [i for i in range(2*n+n, 2*n+2*n, 2)]\n        return a + b + c + d + e\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, solve(int(input())))))\n\n\nIn this code, we first handle the case where n = 1 separately, because the output is different for this case.
