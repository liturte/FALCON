Hoppers can operate in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only propagate themselves in a very limited way.\n\nA computer network is a set of hosts $V$ ($|V| = N$) and direct links $E$ ($|E| = M$). Each direct link connects two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both directions.
