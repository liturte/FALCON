The condition is checked with the `all()` function which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (the list comprehension) are `True`. The list comprehension checks the remainder of `x` divided by every number from 2 to `N` (inclusive) and returns `True` if the remainder is 1.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always a number between 2 and 30.

The function iterates over all integers x from N+1 to 10^13 (inclusive). For each x, it checks if the remainder of x divided by every integer y from 2 to N (inclusive) is 1. If it is, the function returns x. If no such x is found within the range, the function continues to the next x.\n\nThe main part of the program reads an integer N from the standard input, calls find_integer with N as argument, and prints the result.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the code with the sample input\nN =", "def find_number(N):\n    for x in range(N+1, 10**13 + 1):\n        if all(x % y == 1 for y in range(2, N + 1)):\n            return x\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(find_number(N))\n\n\nThis code defines a function `find_number` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns an integer `x` between `N` and `10**13` (inclusive) such that for every integer `y` between `2` and `N` (inclusive), the remainder when `x` is divided by `y` is `1`. The function uses a for loop to iterate over all integers between `N+1` and `10**13`.
