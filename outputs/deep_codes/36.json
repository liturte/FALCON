The function project then projects these coordinates onto a flat 2D plane.\n\nThe function hex_coord uses a for loop to calculate the coordinates. The loop iterates n times, where n is the number of moves. In each iteration, the x coordinate is incremented by 1, and the y and z coordinates are updated based on whether x is even or odd. If x is even, y is incremented", "def hex_coordinates(n):\n    q = 0\n    r = 0\n    s = 0\n    t = n\n    while t > 0:\n        if t >= 6:\n            x = 6\n            t -= x\n            r += x\n            s -= x\n        elif t >= 4:\n            x = 4\n            t -= x\n            q -= x\n            r += x\n        elif t >= 2:\n            x = 2\n            t -= x\n            q += x\n            s -= x\n        else:\n            x = t\n            t -= x\n            q += x\n            r -= x\n            s += x\n    return q, r\n\nn = int(input())\nq, r = hex_coordinates(n)\nprint(q, r)\n\nThis code takes an integer input n and calculates the coordinates of Ayrat after n moves.

It starts at the origin (0, 0). It iteratively adds to the coordinates in a hexagonal spiral pattern, following the rules of hexagonal coordinates. The coordinates are calculated by keeping track of the current direction", "def find_coordinates(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    q, r = divmod(n, 6)\n    if r <= 3:\n        return (r - 1, -3 * q)\n    else:\n        return (3 - r, -3 * q - 2)\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(*find_coordinates(n))\n\nThis code calculates the coordinates of the hexagon where Ayrat is located after n moves. It first checks if n is 0, in which case the coordinates are (0, 0). Then it divides n by 6 to get the quotient and remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 3, the coordinates are calculated based on the first three hexagons. If the remainder is greater than 3, the coordinates are calculated based on the last three hexagons.\n\nThis code uses the `divmod` function to get the quotient and remainder of n divided by 6. The `print(*find_coordinates(n))` line unpacks the tuple returned by `find_coordinates(n)` and prints the two values.\n\nThis code assumes that the hexag", "def hex_coordinates(n):\n    q = 0\n    r = 0\n    s = 0\n    t = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n)):\n        if i % 60 < 15:\n            q += 1\n            r -= 1\n        elif i % 60 < 30:\n            r += 1\n            s -= 1\n        elif i % 60 < 45:\n            s += 1\n            q -= 1\n        elif i % 60 < 60:\n            t += 1\n            r -= 1\n    return q, r\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(*hex_coordinates(n))\n\n\nThis Python code uses a modified version of the Hex coordinate system. The coordinates are calculated based on the number of steps taken by Ayrat. The number of steps taken by Ayrat is given as input and the coordinates are printed as output.\n\nIt's important to note that this code only works for n up to 10^18. If n is larger than this, the code will take a very long time to complete. This is because the number of steps taken by Ayrat grows extremely quickly.\n\nThis"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAyrat is looking for the perfect code.
