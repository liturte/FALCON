However, she doesn\u2019t want to train $40$ hours a day. To avoid much training while still becoming famous, she has concocted a plan: make all her javelins gigantic.\n\nAs a software developer by day, she knows she needs a minimum viable javelin for testing, but also that you can glue existing things hastily together and get something that works alright.\n\nShe has a couple of steel rods next to her bed \u2013 as one does \u2013 and decides to go to the blacksmith apprentice Jack to get him to fuse them together.\n\nThe good thing about Jack is that he\u2019ll fuse the steel rods together for free. But Jack isn\u2019t that good at fusing things together. When fusing two rods, the fused rod will lose $1$ cm of their combined length.\n\nThat\u2019s not a problem for Jessica, but she wonders how big her javelin will become if Jack fuses all the rods together.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consist of an integer $N$, the number of steel rods she has. Then follows $N$ lines, each containing a single integer $l_ i$ representing the length of the steel rod in cm.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint out the length of the jumbo javelin Jack has made for her.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $1 < N \\leq 100$\n - $1 \\leq l_ i \\leq 50$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n21\n34\n18\n9\nSample Output:\n79\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
