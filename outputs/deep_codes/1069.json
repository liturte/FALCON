It calculates the power and returns the result modulus the given number. In this case, it calculates the power of each number from 1 to 4, and then adds them all together. The result is then taken modulus 5.\n\nThe input is read as a string, then converted to an integer. This is done because the input can be very large, and it would not fit in an integer variable.\n\nThe output is printed as it is, without any formatting. This is because the output should be as small as possible, to save time.\n\nThis code works in Python 3. It takes the input, calculates the result, and prints it. It does not check if the input is valid or not.\n\nThe time complexity of", "n = int(input())\nprint((pow(1, n, 5) + pow(2, n, 5) + pow(3, n, 5) + pow(4, n, 5)) % 5)\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in pow function with three arguments, which calculates the power of the first argument modulo the third argument. The result is then added up and the final result is taken modulo 5.\n\nThis solution handles large numbers because pow function with three arguments is implemented in a way that allows it to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nNote to the second sample:\n\nThe result of the expression (1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n) mod 5 is 0 because all powers of 1, 2, 3 and 4 modulo 5 are 1. Therefore the result of the expression is equal to the sum of 4 times 1, which is 4.\n\nNote that the operation x mod y is the remainder of the division", "n = input()\nprint((pow(1, n, 5) + pow(2, n, 5) + pow(3, n, 5) + pow(4, n, 5)) % 5)\n\n\nIn this code, pow(x, y, z) is a function in python which returns the remainder of x^y when divided by z.\n\nThis code calculates the value of the expression without leading zeros.\n\nPlease note that this code will work for n up to 10^10^5. For larger values of n, you may need a more efficient algorithm or a language that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n\nAlso, the time complexity of this code is O(1), which means it will execute in constant time regardless of the size of n.\n\nThis code does not have any memory overhead, which means it will not use any extra space proportional to the size of n.", "print(pow(1, int(input()), 5) + pow(2, int(input()), 5) + pow(3, int(input()), 5) + pow(4, int(input()), 5))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe pow function in Python takes three arguments: a, b and mod. It returns a^b mod mod. Here, we are using pow function for each number from 1 to 4, to the power of the input number n, and taking mod 5 at each step. Then we sum up the results and print the final sum.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work for large inputs as pow function may lead to memory overflow for very large inputs. In such cases, you might need to use modular arithmetic properties to optimize the solution.\n\nAlso, please note that the pow function with three arguments a, b, and mod is not available in some languages. In those languages, you would need to implement the pow function yourself.\n\nThe Python built-in pow function with three arguments is efficient and can handle", "n = input()\nn = int(n)\nresult = (1**n + 2**n + 3**n + 4**n) % 5\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis code calculates the modulus of the sum of the powers of 1, 2, 3, and 4, all taken modulo 5. It will work for any integer n in the range of Python's int type.\n\nPlease note that due to the large size of the number, Python may take a lot of time to compute this.\n\nAlso, in Python 2, the input function returns a string. In Python 3, it returns a bytes object. You may need to convert the input to an integer using the int function if you're using Python 3.\n\nLastly, Python's int type can handle arbitrarily large numbers, but they still have a maximum size. If the number is so large that it exceeds the maximum size, you will get an OverflowError.\n\nFor extremely large inputs, you may need to use a"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFedya studies in a gymnasium.
