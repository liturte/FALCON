{"4236": {"code": ["n", "n", "n", "n", "n"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a set of $n$ segments on the axis $Ox$, each segment has integer endpoints between $1$ and $m$ inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$) \u2014 coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints. \n\nConsider all integer points between $1$ and $m$ inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point $x$ belongs to the segment $[l; r]$ if and only if $l \\le x \\le r$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain two integers each $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$) \u2014 the endpoints of the $i$-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that $l_i=r_i$, i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print one integer $k$ \u2014 the number of points that don't belong to any segment.\n\nIn the second line print exactly $k$ integers in any order \u2014 the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.\n\nIf there are no such points at all, print a single integer $0$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n2 2\n1 2\n5 5\n\nOutput\n2\n3 4 \n\nInput\n1 7\n1 7\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the point $1$ belongs to the second segment, the point $2$ belongs to the first and the second segments and the point $5$ belongs to the third segment. The points $3$ and $4$ do not belong to any segment.\n\nIn the second example all the points from $1$ to $7$ belong to the first segment.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
