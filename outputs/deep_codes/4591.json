A-pizza and B-pizza are completely different pizzas, and AB-pizza is one half of A-pizza and one half of B-pizza combined together. The prices of one A-pizza, B-pizza and AB-pizza are A yen, B yen and C yen (yen is the currency of Japan), respectively.\nNakahashi needs to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas for a party tonight. He can only obtain these pizzas by directly buying A-pizzas and B-pizzas, or buying two AB-pizzas and then rearrange them into one A-pizza and one B-pizza. At least how much money does he need for this? It is fine to have more pizzas than necessary by rearranging pizzas.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 A, B, C \u2264 5000\n - 1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 10^5\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B C X Y\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum amount of money required to prepare X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1500 2000 1600 3 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7900\n\nIt is optimal to buy four AB-pizzas and rearrange them into two A-pizzas and two B-pizzas, then buy additional one A-pizza.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
