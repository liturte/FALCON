This test case begins with a line containing a natural number $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 26$), followed by a line with $k$ symbols (characters in $[a-z]$) separated by spaces. The following $k$ lines contain the assembly table: the $i$-th line has $k$ pairs of the form $\\mathit{time}$-$\\mathit{result}$, where $\\mathit{time}$ is an integer between $0$ and $1000000$ inclusive, and $\\mathit{result}$ a symbol belonging to the preceding set. The $j$-th pair in the $i$-th line represents the time to compose pieces of types represented by the $i$-th and $j$-th symbols, along with the type of the resulting piece. After the table, a line with an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10$) indicates the number of lines that follow, each line containing a non-empty string over the $k$ symbols. Each of these lines is a sequence of components that need to be assembled together in the right order.
