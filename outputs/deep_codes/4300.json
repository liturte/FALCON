The deliciousness of the i-th takoyaki is d_i.\nAs is commonly known, when you eat two takoyaki of deliciousness x and y together, you restore x \\times y health points.\nThere are \\frac{N \\times (N - 1)}{2} ways to choose two from the N takoyaki served in the festival. For each of these choices, find the health points restored from eating the two takoyaki, then compute the sum of these \\frac{N \\times (N - 1)}{2} values.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 50\n - 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nd_1 d_2 ... d_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the sum of the health points restored from eating two takoyaki over all possible choices of two takoyaki from the N takoyaki served.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n3 1 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n11\n\nThere are three possible choices:\n - Eat the first and second takoyaki. You will restore 3 health points.\n - Eat the second and third takoyaki. You will restore 2 health points.\n - Eat the first and third takoyaki. You will restore 6 health points.\nThe sum of these values is 11.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
