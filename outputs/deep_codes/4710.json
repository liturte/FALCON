If it is, it prints 'ABC', otherwise it prints 'ARC'. This is done using a ternary operator. The ternary operator is a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on a condition. The syntax is: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false. In this case, 'ABC' is printed if x is less than 1200, and 'ARC' is printed otherwise.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code Explanation:\n# The code is a simple Python program that reads an integer from the", "x = int(input())\nif x < 1200:\n    print(\"ABC\")\nelse:\n    print(\"ARC\")\n\n\nThis Python code reads the input value and checks if it is less than 1200.
