{"409": {"code": ["s = input()\nif \"AB\" in s and \"BA\" in s:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `in` operator to check if the strings \"AB\" and \"BA\" are in the input string. If they are, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" can overlap. If they cannot overlap, we would need to check for the positions of these substrings in the string and ensure they are not overlapping.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we perform a single pass over the string to check for the substrings.\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only store the input string. This is because we don't use any additional space that scales with the size of the input.", "s = input()\nif \"AB\" in s and \"BA\" in s:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nThis Python program will read a string from input and check if it contains both \"AB\" and \"BA\" substrings. It will print \"YES\" if it does, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe `in` operator in Python checks if a substring is present in a string. It returns `True` if the substring is found, and `False` otherwise. The `if` statement then checks these conditions and prints the appropriate output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" can appear in any order, as per the problem statement.", "s = input()\nif 'AB' in s and 'BA' in s:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\n\nThis solution works by checking if the strings \"AB\" and \"BA\" exist in the input string. If they do, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any unexpected characters.\n\nIt's important to note that this solution is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'A' and 'a' as different characters. If you need a case-insensitive solution, you can convert the input string to lowercase or uppercase before checking for 'AB' and 'BA'.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" can occur in any order within the string. If they can only occur in a specific order, you would need to modify the solution accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" can overlap. If", "s = input()\nif 'AB' in s and 'BA' in s:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\n\nThis code works by first taking an input string s. Then it checks if the string contains both substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" using the 'in' keyword in Python. If both are present, it prints \"YES\", otherwise it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\" can occur in any order and that they can overlap each other. It also assumes that the input string will only contain uppercase Latin letters.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string is small enough to fit into memory. If the input string could be larger than memory, then a different solution would be needed.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input string is a valid Python string. If the input string is not a valid Python string, then the solution would not work.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input string is a string of uppercase Latin letters. If the", "s = input()\nif 'AB' in s and 'BA' in s:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `in` operator to check if the string `s` contains the substrings \"AB\" and \"BA\". It then prints \"YES\" if both substrings are present, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because the `in` operator in Python traverses the string once to check for the substring.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), because no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input string is a valid sequence of uppercase Latin letters.
