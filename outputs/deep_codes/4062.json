{"4062": {"code": ["a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d))\n\n\nThis code reads four integers from input and calculates the maximum possible product of two integers within the given ranges. The maximum product is calculated by considering the four possible combinations of x and y within the ranges of a, b, c, and d.\n\nThe `map` function is used to read the four integers from input and the `split` function is used to split the input string on spaces. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum of the four products.\n\nThe maximum possible value for the product of two integers within the given ranges is the maximum of the four products. This is because the product of two integers is always greater than or equal to the product of the smaller and larger integers.\n\nSo, the code reads the four integers from input, calculates the four products, and then prints the maximum of these four products.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for any potential errors.\n\nNote: This code assumes that a <= b and c <= d. If this is not the case, the code will not behave as expected.", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe maximum product of x and y is obtained by choosing the two extreme numbers from each range for x and y. This is because the product of two extreme numbers is maximized when the two numbers are as close together as possible. Therefore, we simply need to calculate the product of the four extreme numbers (a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d) and return the maximum value.\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `map` function to convert the input string into integers, and the `max` function to find the maximum value.\n\nThe `input().split()` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, based on spaces. The `map` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. Finally, the `max` function returns the maximum value from the four products.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for invalid inputs.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d))\n\nThis solution uses Python's built", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d))\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a simple one-liner python program. It reads the four integers a, b, c, and d from the input. Then it calculates the product of x and y for all possible values of x and y in the range [a, b] and [c, d] and prints the maximum of these products.
