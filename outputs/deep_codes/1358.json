There was his birthday recently. k of his friends came to him to congratulate him, and each of them presented to him a string s_{i} having the same length n. We denote the beauty of the i-th string by a_{i}. It can happen that a_{i} is negative\u00a0\u2014 that means that Santa doesn't find this string beautiful at all.\n\nSanta Claus is crazy about palindromes. He is thinking about the following question: what is the maximum possible total beauty of a palindrome which can be obtained by concatenating some (possibly all) of the strings he has? Each present can be used at most once. Note that all strings have the same length n.\n\nRecall that a palindrome is a string that doesn't change after one reverses it.\n\nSince the empty string is a palindrome too, the answer can't be negative. Even if all a_{i}'s are negative, Santa can obtain the empty string.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two positive integers k and n divided by space and denoting the number of Santa friends and the length of every string they've presented, respectively (1 \u2264 k, n \u2264 100 000; n\u00b7k\u00a0 \u2264 100 000).\n\nk lines follow. The i-th of them contains the string s_{i} and its beauty a_{i} ( - 10 000 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10 000). The string consists of n lowercase English letters, and its beauty is integer. Some of strings may coincide. Also, equal strings can have different beauties.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the required maximum possible beauty.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3\nabb 2\naaa -3\nbba -1\nzyz -4\nabb 5\naaa 7\nxyx 4\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n3 1\na 1\na 2\na 3\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n2 5\nabcde 10000\nabcde 10000\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Santa can obtain abbaaaxyxaaabba by concatenating strings 5, 2, 7, 6 and 3 (in this order).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
