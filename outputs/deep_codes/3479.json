In addition, some of your friends know the city better than others, and so take different amounts of time to drive to the stadium from your house. You\u2019d like to procrastinate as long as possible before hitting the road: can you concoct a transportation plan that gets all people to the stadium in the shortest amount of time possible?\n\nMore specifically, each person $i$ currently at your house can drive to the stadium in $t_ i$ minutes.
