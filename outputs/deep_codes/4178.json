For each height, it checks if the next height is lower. If it is, it checks if the difference is more than 1. If it is, it prints 'No' and exits because it's impossible to achieve the objective.

If the height two positions back is not greater, the code increments the current height by one.

Then it iterates through the heights from left to right. If it finds a square whose height is greater than the next one, it checks the difference between their heights. If the difference is more than 1, it prints 'No' and terminates the program. If the difference is 1, it checks if the previous square's height is greater than the next one.

If it finds a pair where this is not possible, it outputs \"No\" and exits. If it doesn't find such a pair after checking all pairs, it outputs \"Yes\".\n\nThe time complexity of this script is O(N), where N is the number of squares. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the input heights.\n\nThe script assumes that the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are N squares arranged in a row from left to right.
