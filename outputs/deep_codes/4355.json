It then calculates the value a + a^2 + a^3 using the exponentiation operator '**' and the addition operator '+'. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThe calculation a + a^2 + a^3 is based on the problem statement. 'a' is added to the square of 'a' (a^2) and then this result is added to the cube of 'a' (a^3).\n\nFor example, if 'a' is 2, the code will calculate 2 + 2^2 + 2^3, which equals 2 + 4 + 8 = 14. This result is then printed to", "s = input()\nprint(s[::-1])\n\n\nThis code takes a string s as input, and prints its reverse by slicing the string with a step of -1 (which means start from the end and go to the start).\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nGiven a string s, print its length.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100\n - s consists of lowercase English letters only.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format", "a = int(input())\nprint(a + a**2 + a**3)\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# SAMPLE I/O\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Sample Input:\n# 2\n\n# Sample Output:\n# 14\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# CODE\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n\ndef main():\n    a = int(input())\n    print(a + a**2 + a**3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# END\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# EXPLANATION\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n# This program reads an integer a from input, and then calculates and prints the value of a + a^2 + a^3.\n# This is done using the Python exponentiation operator (**), which raises the number on its left to the power of the number on its right.\n# In this case, a**2 raises a to the power of 2, and a**3 raises a to the power of 3.\n# The results of these calculations are then added together and printed.\n# The result of the calculation is an integer, so the print statement uses the str() function to convert the result to a string before printing.\n# This is not necessary for the calculation itself, but is necessary for the output to be correctly formatted.\n# The input()", "a = int(input())\nprint(a + a**2 + a**3)\n\n\nThis program first reads an integer `a` from input. Then it calculates `a + a^2 + a^3` and prints the result.\n\nHere, `**` is the exponentiation operator in Python. It raises the number on its left to the power of the number on its right. For example, `2**3` is `2*2*2`, which equals `8`.\n\nFinally, the `print` function outputs the result.\n\nThis code will work for all inputs that are in the range 1 to 10 (inclusive), as specified by the problem constraints.", "a = int(input())\nprint(a + a**2 + a**3)\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer 'a' from the standard input, calculates the expression a + a^2 + a^3 and prints the result.\n\nThis program uses the ** operator for exponentiation in Python. The int function is used to convert the input string to an integer, since the input function returns a string.\n\nThe print function is used to output the result of the calculation.\n\nPlease note that Python's exponentiation operator is **, not ^.\n\nAlso, this program does not handle any input errors, such as if the user enters a non-integer or a number not in the range 1 to 10. This is not specified in the problem, but it is a good practice to handle such cases in real-world programs.\n\nThis program does not include any error handling for input outside the range 1 to 10, as it is not specified in the problem statement. It is recommended to add error handling for such cases.\n\nThe program does not include any formatting or rounding of the output, as it is not specified in the problem statement. It is recommended to add such formatting and rounding for the sake of readability and user experience.\n\nThe program does not include any comments or explanations, as per the problem statement. It is recommended to add comments and explanations for the sake of understanding and maintainability.\n\nOverall, this"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven an integer a as input, print the value a + a^2 + a^3.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq a \\leq 10\n - a is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the value a + a^2 + a^3 as an integer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n14\n\nWhen a = 2, we have a + a^2 + a^3 = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.\nPrint the answer as an input.
