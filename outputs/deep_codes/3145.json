A multiple of $X$ is any number divisible by $X$.\n\nIn order to ruin Zvonko\u2019s fun, his mother decided to get a program that solves the problem. Write a program that calculates how many multiples of $X$ are between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive), such that, when written in decimal, they contain only certain allowed digits.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three integers $X$, $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\le X < 10^{11}$ , $1 \\le A \\le B < 10^{11}$). The second line contains the allowed digits. The digits will be given with no spaces, sorted in increasing order and without duplicates. There will be at least one allowed digit.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of multiples Zvonko can make on a single line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 1 20\n0123456789\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 100 9294\n23689\nSample Output 2:\n111\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
