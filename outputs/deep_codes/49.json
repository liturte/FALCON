Once the length of s is greater than or equal to k, the loop ends.\n\nThe print statement then prints the k-th character of the string s (index k-1 because the indices start at 0 in Python).\n\nThis code works because the number of digits in the sequence increases by 1 for each new number added, so the length of the string s after k iterations will be at least k. Therefore, the k-th digit of the sequence is the k-th character of the string s.\n\nNote: This code assumes that k is a positive integer and that k is not larger than 10^12. If k is larger than 10^12, the code may not terminate or produce incorrect results.", "k = int(input())\ns = ''\ni = 1\nwhile len(s) < k:\n    s += str(i)\n    i += 1\nprint(s[k-1])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code creates an infinite sequence of numbers as a string, then prints the k-th digit. The while loop continues to add numbers to the string until the string's length is greater than or equal to k. Then it prints the k-th digit of the string.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the k-th digit in the sequence. This is because the while loop continues until the string's length is greater than or equal to k, and each iteration of the loop adds a digit to the string. The space complexity is also O(n), because the string stores all the digits in the sequence.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be a positive integer no larger than 10^12. If the input is larger than this, the code may take a long time to run or may not run at all due to memory constraints.\n\nPlease note that this code does not check if the input is a positive integer and", "k = int(input())\ndigits = 0\nlength = 0\nstart = 1\n\nwhile length + digits * (start * 10 - start) < k:\n    length += digits * (start * 10 - start)\n    start *= 10\n    digits += 1\n\nk -= length\nstart += (k - 1) // digits\nprint(str(start)[(k - 1) % digits])\n\n\nThis code works by first calculating how many digits are in the current \"chunk\" of numbers, where \"chunk\" is defined as a set of consecutive numbers with the same number of digits. It then determines which \"chunk\" the kth digit is in by dividing k by the number of digits in each chunk. It then calculates the starting number of the chunk and the position of the kth digit within that chunk. Finally, it prints the kth digit.\n\nPlease note that the complexity of this code is O(log(k)).", "k = int(input())\ns = ''\ni = 1\nwhile len(s) < k:\n    s += str(i)\n    i += 1\nprint(s[k-1])\n\nThis code works by concatenating the string `s` with the string representation of the number `i` until the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`. Then, it prints the `k`-th character of `s`.\n\nPlease note that Python uses 0-based indexing, so we need to subtract 1 from `k` when accessing the character.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the number `k`. This is because we are concatenating the string `s` with the string representation of the number `i` until `s` is at least as long as `k`. The space complexity is also O(n), because we are storing all the digits in the string `s`.\n\nThis code will run correctly for all values of `k` up to $10^{12}$, but it may take a long time to run for larger values due", "k = int(input())\n\ndigits = 1\nwhile k > 9 * digits * (10 ** (digits - 1)):\n    k -= 9 * digits * (10 ** (digits - 1))\n    digits += 1\n\nk -= 1\nprint(int(str(10 ** (digits - 1) + k // digits)[k % digits]))\n\n\nThis code first finds the number of digits that the number k is in. It then subtracts the amount of numbers that have less than the number of digits from k, and updates k to be the remainder. Finally, it prints the k-th digit of the number that k is in.\n\nFor example, if k is 21, the number of digits is 2, and k is 10. So, k is updated to 1. Then, the code prints the 1-th digit of the number 10. The result is 0.\n\nIf k is 7, the number of digits is 1, and k is 7. So, k is updated to 7.
