As a renowned data provider in the area, you now have $N$ precious pieces of data. You want to sell all $N$ pieces of data to $N$ customers. You can sell multiple pieces of data (including all and none) to a single customer. However, each piece of data must be sold to exactly one customer (you cannot split a single piece of data and sell it to multiple customers).\n\nIn your previous transactions you simply sold bigger data for higher prices. Unfortunately, that did not work quite well and your customers were a bit unsatisfied about the value of the data they got. Obviously, the value of data is not necessarily positively correlated with its volume.\n\nThis time you decide to do something different. After many meetings you finally sign a new contract with your customers. You number the $N$ pieces of data from $1$ to $N$ and figure out that the $i^\\textrm {th}$ piece of data has a special property $S_ i$. The new contract specifies that each customer shall pay you an amount of money that is equal to the number of distinct prime factors in the sum of $S_ i$\u2019s of the data pieces sold to him/her.\n\nBased on the new contract, what is the maximum revenue you can achieve by selling all $N$ pieces of data?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line has a single integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 14$). The second line has $N$ positive integers, $S_1, S_2, \\ldots , S_ N$. These integers are no larger than $1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum revenue you can achieve by selling all $N$ pieces of data.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1\n1\nSample Output 1:\n0\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n4 7 8\nSample Output 2:\n3\n\nSample Input 3:\n5\n2 3 4 5 8\nSample Output 3:\n5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
