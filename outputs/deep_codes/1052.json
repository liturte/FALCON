We first initialize a 2D array dp with size n+1 by n+1, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to choose j elements from i elements. Then we fill up the dp array by iterating i from 1 to n and j from 0 to i. For each (i, j), we have two choices: either choose the i-th element or not. If we choose it, we have dp[i-1][j-1]", "import math\n\ndef fact(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * fact(n - 1)\n\ndef comb(n, k):\n    return fact(n) // (fact(k) * fact(n - k))\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nres = 0\n\nfor i in range(k, n + 1):\n    res += comb(n, i) * comb(n - i, k)\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nThis solution uses the concept of combinatorics. It first calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. Then it calculates the combination of n items taken k at a time using the formula n!/((n-k)!k!). This is used to calculate the number of ways to choose indices from the permutation that are to be changed to be equal to their positions.\n\nThe main loop calculates the number of ways to choose these indices and the number of ways to arrange the remaining (n - i) elements in a way that k of them are equal to their positions. It adds these two quantities to the result for each i from", "from math import comb\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(sum(comb(n, i) * comb(n - i, k) for i in range(k + 1, n + 1)))\n\n\nThis solution uses the fact that the number of almost identity permutations is the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n, i) * C(n - i, k) for i in range(k + 1, n + 1), where C(n, i) is the binomial coefficient, i.e., the number of ways to choose i elements from a set of n elements.\n\nThis solution works by first reading in the values of n and k. Then, it computes the sum of the binomial coefficients for all possible values of i, and prints the result.\n\nThe binomial coefficients are computed using the comb function from the math module, which returns the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is provided as two space-separated integers on a single line.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a single pass through the range of i values and the binom", "def almost_identity_permutations(n, k):\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n    return sum(dp[n][j] for j in range(k, n + 1))\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(almost_identity_permutations(n, k))\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of almost identity permutations.

The dp[i][j] represents the number of almost identity permutations of size i with exactly j indices that are equal to their original values. For each i, we have two choices: either the current index is the same as the original one, or it's not.
