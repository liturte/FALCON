According to the statement, the first move is always putting one candy in the box. Hence Alya ate $0$ candies.\n\nIn the second example the possible sequence of Alya's actions looks as follows:   put $1$ candy,  put $2$ candies,  eat a candy,  eat a candy,  put $3$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $4$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $5$ candies.  \n\nThis way, she will make exactly $n=9$ actions and in the end the box will contain $1+2-1-1+3-1+4-1+5=11$ candies. The answer is $4$, since she ate $4$ candies in total.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
