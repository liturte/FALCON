Unfortunately, this makes it somewhat hard to get a programming job in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The trendy Stockholm hipsters only accept applicants speaking the standard Swedish dialect, rikssvenska.\n\nTo increase his chances of passing interviews, he wishes to practice talking rikssvenska. To help him with this, he wants you to write a program that can determine whenever he accidentally reverts to speaking \u00f6stg\u00f6tska.\n\nA simple way of determining if a sentence is written in \u00f6stg\u00f6tska is if at least $40\\% $ of the words in the sentence contains the letter \u00e4. For simplicity, this is encoded as the letter combination ae (meaning any appearance of the substring ae is to be regarded as an occurrence of the letter \u00e4).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input contains a sequence of space-separated words. Each word consists only of letters a-z. There are at most $100$ words, and each word contains at most $15$ letters a-z (meaning that the ae combination counts as two letters for this limit).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cdae ae ju traeligt va\u201d if the input sentence is in \u00f6stg\u00f6tska, otherwise output \u201chaer talar vi rikssvenska\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\ndae ae ju traeligt va\nSample Output:\ndae ae ju traeligt va\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
