There is a paper strip which is divided into n + 1 cells numbered from left to right starting from 0. There is a chip placed in the n-th cell (the last one).\n\nPlayers take turns, Alice is first. Each player during his or her turn has to move the chip 1, 2 or k cells to the left (so, if the chip is currently in the cell i, the player can move it into cell i - 1, i - 2 or i - k). The chip should not leave the borders of the paper strip: it is impossible, for example, to move it k cells to the left if the current cell has number i < k. The player who can't make a move loses the game.\n\nWho wins if both participants play optimally?\n\nAlice and Bob would like to play several games, so you should determine the winner in each game.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the single integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of games. Next T lines contain one game per line. All games are independent.\n\nEach of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9, 3 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the length of the strip and the constant denoting the third move, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each game, print Alice if Alice wins this game and Bob otherwise.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n0 3\n3 3\n3 4\n4 4\n\nOutput\nBob\nAlice\nBob\nAlice\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
