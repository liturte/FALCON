The i-th edge connects Vertex c_i and Vertex d_i.\nInitially, Vertex i has the value a_i written on it. You want to change the values on Vertex 1, \\ldots, Vertex N to b_1, \\cdots, b_N, respectively, by doing the operation below zero or more times.\n - Choose an edge, and let Vertex x and Vertex y be the vertices connected by that edge. Choose one of the following and do it:\n - Decrease the value a_x by 1, and increase the value a_y by 1.\n - Increase the value a_x by 1, and decrease the value a_y by 1.\nDetermine whether it is possible to achieve the objective by properly doing the operation.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 0 \\leq M \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - -10^9 \\leq a_i,b_i \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq c_i,d_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is simple, that is, has no self-loops and no multi-edges.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\na_1 \\cdots a_N\nb_1 \\cdots b_N\nc_1 d_1\n\\vdots\nc_M d_M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint Yes if it is possible to achieve the objective by properly doing the operation, and No otherwise.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\n1 2 3\n2 2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nYou can achieve the objective by, for example, doing the operation as follows:\n - In the first operation, choose the edge connecting Vertex 1 and 2. Then, increase a_1 by 1 and decrease a_2 by 1.\n - In the second operation, choose the edge connecting Vertex 2 and 3. Then, increase a_2 by 1 and decrease a_3 by 1.\nThis sequence of operations makes a_1=2, a_2=2, and a_3=2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
