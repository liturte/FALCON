This time, he wrote $N$ non-negative integers so that they form a ring (circle). After that he formed a new ring by adding to each number its two neighbours.\n\nThe teacher noticed this and took away the first piece of paper, with the original ring. This did not trouble Luka much because he knows he can use the other ring to reconstruct the original.\n\nWrite a program that solves Luka\u2019s problem.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $N$ $(3 \\le N \\le 10000)$, the number of integers in the ring.\n\nEach of the following lines contains an integer less than $10^9$ (one billion). These numbers, in order, form the second ring.\n\nThe input will be such that a solution, although not necesarily unique, will always exist.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the original ring on $N$ lines. The numbers must be non-negative.\n\nRotating the ring is not allowed. For example, the sum of the first three output numbers must be equal to the second number in the input ring.\n\nNote: the solution need not be unique.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n5\n5\n5\nSample Output 1:\n2\n1\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n20\n15\n17\n14\nSample Output 2:\n5\n8\n2\n7\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
