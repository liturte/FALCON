For this week\u2019s lesson she has the children form a circle and (carefully) throw around a petrified dragon egg.\n\nThe $n$ children are numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ (it is a Computer Science class after all) clockwise around the circle. Child $0$ always starts with the egg. Daenerys will call out one of two things:\n - a number $t$, indicating that the egg is to be thrown to the child who is $t$ positions clockwise from the current egg holder, wrapping around if necessary. If $t$ is negative, then the throw is to the counter-clockwise direction.\n - the phrase undo $m$, indicating that the last $m$ throws should be undone. Note that undo commands never undo other undo commands; they just undo commands described in item $1$ above.\n\nFor example, if there are $5$ children, and the teacher calls out the four throw commands 8 -2 3 undo 2, the throws will start from child $0$ to child $3$, then from child $3$ to child $1$, then from child $1$ to child $4$. After this, the undo 2 instructions will result in the egg being thrown back from child $4$ to child $1$ and then from child $1$ back to child $3$.
