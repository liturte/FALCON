The max() function is used to find the maximum value among the three numbers.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement. If the input format might vary, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(1), which means it runs in constant time, regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and the output.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur, such as if the input does not contain exactly two integers. You may want to add error handling code to handle these situations in a real-world application.\n\nThe code is also assuming that Python 3 is being used. If you are using a different programming language, the syntax and some of the built-in functions may vary.\n\nThe code does not include any comments or explanations. This is because the purpose of the code is to solve the problem as stated, without any additional context or explanation.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B, A - B, A * B))\n\n\nThis solution uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value among the three given numbers. It first splits the input line into two integers A and B. Then it computes the sum, difference, and product of A and B, and finds the maximum among these three values. The result is then printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified range. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B, A - B, A * B))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution is a one-liner Python program that takes two integers A and B as input, calculates the three values (A + B, A - B, A * B), and prints the maximum of these three values. The max() function is used to find the maximum value.\n\nThe input() function reads a line from input (standard input), and the split() function splits this line into words. The map() function applies the int() function to each word, converting them to integers. The results are returned as a list. The variables A and B are then assigned these two integers.\n\nThe print() function prints the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it always executes the same number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), as it always uses the same amount of memory regardless of the input size.\n\nThis solution works for all possible integer values of A and B, as required by the problem constraints.\n\nNote: The \\times operator is used to denote multiplication in Python, so if you're seeing it in the code, it's not a typo.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\n\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B, A -", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A + B, A - B, A * B))\n\n\nThis Python script reads two integers A and B from the standard input.
