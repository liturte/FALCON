The examination consists of N questions, and the score allocated to the i-th question is s_i. Your answer to each question will be judged as either \"correct\" or \"incorrect\", and your grade will be the sum of the points allocated to questions that are answered correctly. When you finish answering the questions, your answers will be immediately judged and your grade will be displayed... if everything goes well.\nHowever, the examination system is actually flawed, and if your grade is a multiple of 10, the system displays 0 as your grade. Otherwise, your grade is displayed correctly. In this situation, what is the maximum value that can be displayed as your grade?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All input values are integers.\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n - 1 \u2264 s_i \u2264 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\ns_1\ns_2\n:\ns_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum value that can be displayed as your grade.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n5\n10\n15\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n25\n\nYour grade will be 25 if the 10-point and 15-point questions are answered correctly and the 5-point question is not, and this grade will be displayed correctly. Your grade will become 30 if the 5-point question is also answered correctly, but this grade will be incorrectly displayed as 0.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
