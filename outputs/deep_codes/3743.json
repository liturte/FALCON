First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate.\n\nThe path consists of $n$ consecutive tiles, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Ujan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path aesthetic if for any two different tiles with numbers $i$ and $j$, such that $|j - i|$ is a divisor of $n$ greater than $1$, they have the same color. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers $i$ and $j$ should be the same if $|i-j| > 1$ and $n \\bmod |i-j| = 0$ (where $x \\bmod y$ is the remainder when dividing $x$ by $y$).\n\nUjan wants to brighten up space. What is the maximum number of different colors that Ujan can use, so that the path is aesthetic?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{12}$), the length of the path.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer, the maximum possible number of colors that the path can be painted in.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, two colors is the maximum number. Tiles $1$ and $3$ should have the same color since $4 \\bmod |3-1| = 0$. Also, tiles $2$ and $4$ should have the same color since $4 \\bmod |4-2| = 0$.\n\nIn the second sample, all five colors can be used.
