{"4400": {"code": ["S = input()\nprint(max(len(i) for i in S.split('S')))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code works by first reading the input string S. It then splits the string at every 'S', creating a list of substrings. Each substring represents a consecutive sequence of rainy days. The length of each substring is counted and the maximum length is found using the built-in max() function. This maximum length is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe max() function is used with a generator expression, which calculates the length of each substring as it is needed. This avoids the need to store all the lengths in a list in memory at once, which can save memory if the input string is very large.\n\nThe split() function is used with 'S' as the separator, so it splits the string at every 'S' character. This ensures that all consecutive sequences of rainy days are separated into separate substrings.\n\nFinally, the print() function outputs the maximum length, which is the maximum number of consecutive rainy days.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string S is a valid weather record for three days. If this is not the case, the code may not work correctly.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n),", "S = input()\nrainy_days = [0] * 3\nfor i in range(3):\n    if S[i] == 'R':\n        rainy_days[i] = 1\n    if i > 0:\n        rainy_days[i] += rainy_days[i - 1]\nprint(max(rainy_days))\n\n\nThis code first initializes an array `rainy_days` of size 3 with all elements as 0. Then it iterates over the string `S`. If the i-th character of `S` is 'R', it sets `rainy_days[i]` as 1, otherwise it sets `rainy_days[i]` as `rainy_days[i - 1]`. Finally, it prints the maximum element in the `rainy_days` array.\n\nThis code works because the maximum number of consecutive rainy days is the maximum value in the `rainy_days` array.\n\nFor example, if `S` is 'RRS', `rainy_days` will be [1, 2, 2]. So, the maximum value in `rainy_days` is 2, which is the maximum number of consecutive rainy days.", "S = input()\ncount = 0\nmax_count = 0\n\nfor i in S:\n    if i == 'R':\n        count += 1\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n    else:\n        count = 0\n\nprint(max_count)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads the string S from the input. It then initializes two variables, count and max_count, to 0. The count variable is used to keep track of the current number of consecutive rainy days, and max_count is used to keep track of the maximum number of such days encountered so far.\n\nThe code then iterates over each character in the string S. If the character is 'R', it increments count and checks if count is greater than max_count. If it is, it updates max_count. If the character is not 'R', it resets count to 0.\n\nFinally, the code prints the value of max_count, which is the maximum number of consecutive rainy days.\n\nIn the sample input 'RRS', the maximum number of consecutive rainy days is 2 (on the 1-st and 2-nd days).\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string S always has a length of", "S = input()\nprint(max(map(len, S.split('S'))))\n\n\nThis Python code works by first splitting the input string `S` into a list of substrings whenever it encounters a 'S'. This is done using the `split` function. The `map` function is then used to apply the `len` function to each of these substrings, effectively counting the number of rainy days in each substring. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum number of rainy days in the whole period.\n\nFor example, if `S` is 'RRS', the split operation would result in ['RR', ''], and the map operation would result in [2, 0]. The maximum of these values is 2, so the answer is 2.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the weather records are given in the order they occurred. If the order is not guaranteed, the solution would need to be modified to consider all possible permutations of the three days.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that a day is considered to be rainy if it starts with 'R'. If a day is considered to be rainy if it ends with 'R', the solution would need to be modified to reverse the string before splitting.\n\nPlease note that the solution provided does not handle the", "S = input()\nprint(max(len(i) for i in S.split('S')))\n\n\nThis Python code takes an input string S, splits the string by 'S' to get a list of consecutive rainy and sunny days. Then it uses the max function to find the maximum length of the list, which is the maximum number of consecutive rainy days.\n\nThe split function divides the string into a list of substrings at each occurrence of 'S'. The max function then finds the maximum value in the list of lengths.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"RRS\", the list of substrings is ['RR', ''], and the list of lengths is [2, 0]. The maximum length is 2, so the output is 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nS = input()\nprint(max(len(i) for i in S.split('S')))\n\n\nThis Python code takes an input string S, splits the string by 'S' to get a list of consecutive rainy and sunny days.
