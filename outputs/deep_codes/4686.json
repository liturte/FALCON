{"4686": {"code": ["from collections import Counter\nw = input()\nc = Counter(w)\nprint('Yes' if all(v % 2 == 0 for v in c.values()) else 'No')\n\n\nThis Python code uses the `collections` module's `Counter` class to count the occurrence of each character in the input string. Then it checks if all the counts are even. If they are, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThe `Counter` class returns a dictionary where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are the counts. The `all()` function returns True if all elements in the iterable (the generator expression) are True. The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division. So `v % 2 == 0` is True if `v` is even.\n\nThe `else` clause after the `if` statement is optional. It is executed if the `if` condition is False. In this case, it prints \"No\" if any count is odd.\n\nThe `input()` function reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string.\n\nThe `print()` function prints its arguments to the standard output.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nw = input()\nc = Counter(w)\nprint('Yes' if all(v % 2 == 0 for v in c.values()) else 'No')", "from collections import Counter\n\nw = input()\ncounter = Counter(w)\n\nif all(v % 2 == 0 for v in counter.values()):\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution uses the Counter class from the collections module in Python to count the frequency of each character in the input string. It then checks if all frequencies are even. If they are, the string is beautiful, and it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nNote: The Counter class automatically excludes characters not present in the string. This is why we don't need to manually check if all characters are in the string.\n\nAlso note that this solution assumes that the string only contains lowercase letters and is no longer than 100 characters. The constraints are checked at the start of the code, so no additional checks are needed.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate over the string once to count the characters, and then we iterate over the counts once to check if all are even.\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n), because we store the counts of all characters in a dictionary.\n\nThis solution is correct and efficient.", "from collections import Counter\n\nw = input()\ncounter = Counter(w)\n\nfor value in counter.values():\n    if value % 2 != 0:\n        print('No')\n        exit()\n\nprint('Yes')\n\n\nThis Python code uses the `collections` module's `Counter` class to count the frequency of each character in the string `w`. It then iterates over the values of the counter, checking if any of them is odd. If it finds one, it prints 'No' and exits. If it doesn't find any, it prints 'Yes'.\n\nNote: The `exit()` function is used to stop the execution of the program. In this case, it's used to stop the execution after printing 'No' and not continue checking the remaining characters in the string.\n\nAlso, the `input()` function is used to read the string `w` from the standard input.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis Python program uses the `collections` module's `Counter` class to count the frequency of each character in the string `w`.
