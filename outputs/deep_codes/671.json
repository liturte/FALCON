{"671": {"code": ["n = int(input())\nprint(str(n)[0]) if n % 10 == 0 else print(str(n)[0])\n\n\nThis code reads the input integer n and checks if it's divisible by 10. If it is, it prints the first digit of n (which is also the n-th digit of the string). If it's not, it prints the first digit of n.\n\nThis is because every 10th number has a leading zero, so if n is divisible by 10, it means that the n-th digit is a '0'. If n is not divisible by 10, it means that the n-th digit is the first digit of n.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a positive integer, as per the problem statement.\n\nPlease note that this solution is written in Python.", "n = int(input())\nprint(str(n)[-1])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code takes an input n and prints the last digit of n. If n is 11, it will print '1', if n is 100, it will print '0', and so on. The last digit of n is always the same as the last digit of n converted to a string. This is done by accessing the last character of the string representation of n (str(n)[-1]).\n\n\n\nThis is because the last digit of a number n is the remainder when n is divided by 10. This is the same as the last digit of the string representation of n.\n\n\n\nHere is a python code snippet to demonstrate this:\n\n\nn = 10\nprint(str(n)[-1])  # Prints '0'\n\nn = 11\nprint(str(n)[-1])  # Prints '", "n = int(input())\ns = \"\"\nfor i in range(1, 1000):\n    s += str(i)\nprint(s[n-1])\n\n\n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(str(n)[n-1])\n\n\n\n\nn = int(input())\ns = \"\"\ni = 1\nwhile len(s) <= n:\n    s += str(i)\n    i += 1\nprint(s[n-1])\n\n\n\n\nn = int(input())\ns = \"\"\ni = 1\nwhile len(s) <= n:\n    s += str(i)\n    i += 1\nprint(s[n-1])\n\n\n\n\nn = int(input())\ns = \"\".join(str(i) for i in range(1, n+1))\nprint(s[n-1])", "def nth_digit(n):\n    length = 1\n    count = 9\n    start = 1\n\n    while n > length * count:\n        n -= length * count\n        length += 1\n        count *= 10\n        start *= 10\n\n    start += (n - 1) // length\n    return int(str(start)[(n - 1) % length])\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(nth_digit(n))\n\n\nThis code works by counting the number of digits in the sequence of integers that start with 1, up to the nth digit. It then determines which integer the nth digit belongs to, and returns the nth digit of that integer.\n\nThe while loop continues until the nth digit is found. The variables length, count, and start are used to keep track of the number of digits in the sequence, the count of digits in the current integer, and the starting number of the", "def find_nth_digit(n):\n    # start with 1 digit, length 1\n    len_digits = 1\n    len_numbers = 9\n    start = 1\n\n    while n > len_digits * len_numbers:\n        n -= len_digits * len_numbers\n        len_digits += 1\n        len_numbers *= 10\n        start *= 10\n\n    # find which number the n-th digit is in\n    start += (n - 1) // len_digits\n    # find the n-th digit in this number\n    return int(str(start)[(n - 1) % len_digits])\n\nprint(find_nth_digit(int(input())))\n\n\nThis program works by keeping track of the length of the numbers, the starting number of these numbers, and the number of digits in these numbers.
