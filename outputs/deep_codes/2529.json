Then, a condition checks if X is a multiple of 5 and if withdrawing X plus the bank charges (0.5) will not exceed the current balance Y. If both conditions are met, the account balance is updated by subtracting the withdrawal amount and the bank charges. If the conditions are not met, the account balance remains the same. The final balance is then printed with 2", "x, y = map(float, input().split())\n\nif x % 5 == 0 and x + 0.5 <= y:\n    print(round(y - x - 0.5, 2))\nelse:\n    print(round(y, 2))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code firstly reads the input data and converts them to float numbers. If the amount to withdraw (x) is a multiple of 5 and it will not exceed the account balance (y), it subtracts the withdrawal amount and bank charges from the balance and prints the result. If the conditions are not met, it just prints the current balance. The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nIn the examples, if the input is \"30 120", "X,Y = map(float,input().split())\nif X%5==0 and X+0.50<=Y:\n    print(\"{:.2f}\".format(Y-X-0.50))\nelif X%5==0 and X+0.50>Y:\n    print(\"{:.2f}\".format(Y))\nelse:\n    print(\"{:.2f}\".format(Y))\n\n\nThis program first checks if the withdrawal amount is a multiple of 5 and if it is less than or equal to the balance. If these conditions are met, the program subtracts the withdrawal amount and bank charges from the balance. If the conditions are not met, the program prints the current balance.\n\nThe \"{", "X, Y = map(float, input().split())\n\nif X % 5 == 0 and X + 0.5 <= Y:\n    print(round(Y - X - 0.5, 2))\nelse:\n    print(round(Y, 2))\n\n\nThis Python solution uses the input() function to read the values X and Y from the user. It then checks if X is a multiple of 5 and if subtracting X and 0.5 from Y would result in a positive number. If both conditions are met, it subtracts X and 0.5 from Y and prints the result. If either condition is not met, it simply prints Y. The round() function is used to format the result to 2 decimal places.\n\nPlease note that the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nPooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges).  For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.\n\nCalculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.  \n\n-----Input-----\nPositive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.\n\nNonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision.  If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.\n\n-----Example - Successful Transaction-----\nInput:\n30 120.00\n\nOutput:\n89.50\n\n-----Example - Incorrect Withdrawal Amount (not multiple of 5)-----\nInput:\n42 120.00\n\nOutput:\n120.00\n\n-----Example - Insufficient Funds-----\nInput:\n300 120.00\n\nOutput:\n120.00\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
