It then iterates over the string, checking each subsequence of 3 characters. If the subsequence is 'ABC', it increments the count. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nNote: The `input()` function reads a line from the standard input, and `int(input())` reads an integer. The `[i:i+3]` part of the code is a slice that gets the subsequence of 3 characters starting at index `i`.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is in the correct format, and doesn't check for errors. If the input might not be in the correct format, you should add error checking code.\n\nNote: This code uses a brute force approach to solve the problem, which means it checks all possible subsequences of length 3. This is fine for small inputs, but for large inputs it may be slow. If performance is a concern, you could use a different approach.\n\nNote: This code counts overlapping occurrences.

For each substring of length 3, it checks if it equals 'ABC'. If it does, it increments the count. At the end, it prints the count.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input string `S` is properly formatted and does not contain any invalid characters. If this might not be the case, you should add error checking to handle these situations.\n\nAlso, note that this solution is case-sensitive, meaning it will treat 'ABC' and 'abc' as different strings. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert `S` to lower or upper case before the loop.", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\n\ncount = start = 0\nwhile True:\n    start = S.find('ABC', start) + 1\n    if start > 0:\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code starts by reading the input N and S. It then initializes two variables, count and start, to 0. The count variable will be used to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'ABC', and the start variable will be used to specify the start position for the next search. The while loop continues until 'ABC' is no longer found in S. In each iteration of the loop, find() is used to find the next occurrence of 'ABC', starting from the position specified by start. If 'ABC' is found, count is incremented by 1, and start is updated to the position after the found 'ABC' for the next search. If 'ABC' is not found, the loop breaks. Finally, the count is printed, which represents the number of contiguous subsequences of 'ABC' in S.\n\nNote: The find() method returns -1 if the specified value is not found. Therefore, the condition for breaking the loop is start > 0, which is true if 'ABC' is found in S and false if 'ABC' is", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N-2):\n    if S[i:i+3] == 'ABC':\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis Python code reads the length of the string `N` and the string `S` from the standard input. It then iterates over the string `S`, checking for the substring 'ABC' of length 3 at each position `i`. If it finds 'ABC', it increments the count. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nThis code assumes that the string `S` is at least 3 characters long. If `N` is less than 3, the code will not enter the loop and print 0, as there are no possible subsequences of length 3 in a string of length less than 3.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Python code\nN = int(input())\nS = input()\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N-2):\n    if S[i:i+3] == 'ABC':\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis code reads the length of the string `N` and the string `S` from the standard input.
