George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory. \n\nGeorge and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has n rooms in total. At the moment the i-th room has p_{i} people living in it and the room can accommodate q_{i} people in total (p_{i} \u2264 q_{i}). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of rooms.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers p_{i} and q_{i} (0 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of people who already live in the i-th room and the room's capacity.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of rooms where George and Alex can move in.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\n1 10\n0 10\n10 10\n\nOutput\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
