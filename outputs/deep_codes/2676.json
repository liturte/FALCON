Teddy has a pile of strings of size $N$. Each string $Si$ in the pile has length less or equal to $100$ ($len(Si) \\leq 100$). \nTeddy and Freddy like playing with strings. Teddy gives Freddy a string $B$ of size $M$.\nTeddy and Freddy like playing with strings. Teddy gives Freddy a string $B$ of size $M$.\nHe asks Freddy to find the count of the unique substrings of $B$ present in pile of strings of size $N$.\nFreddy is busy with the some task, so he asks for your help.Help Freddy by giving the unique substrings of $B$ present in pile of strings of size $N$.\nNote: The substrings having same permutation of characters are considered same.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $N$, number of strings. Then the strings follow. \n- Next $N$ lines will contain a string \n- $N+2$ line contains the $M$ - length of string B\n- Following line contains the string B\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output in a single line number of unique strings of B.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $2 \\leq len(Si) \\leq 100$\n- $2 \\leq M \\leq 100$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4\na\nabc \nabcd\nabcde\n5\naaaaa\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4\na\naa\naaa\naaaa\n5\naaaaa\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n4\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nTestCase 1: Only substring of $aaaaa$ that is present in the pile of strings is $a$. So the answer is 1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
