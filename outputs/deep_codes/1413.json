A substring $s[l \\dots r]$ of $s$ is called even if the number represented by it is even. \n\nFind the number of even substrings of $s$. Note, that even if some substrings are equal as strings, but have different $l$ and $r$, they are counted as different substrings.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 65000$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe second line contains a string $s$ of length $n$.

Note, that while substrings $s[1 \\dots 1]$ and $s[2 \\dots 2]$ both define the substring \"2\", they are still counted as different substrings.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
