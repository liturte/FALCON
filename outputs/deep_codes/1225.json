The function `solve(h)` takes an integer `h` as input, representing the health of the monster. If `h` is 1, the function returns 1, because it takes 1 attack to kill a monster with health 1. Otherwise, the function calls itself with the argument `h//2`, adds 1 to account for the attack it just made, and returns the result. This process repeats until `h` is 1.

It keeps track of the number of attacks made, which is the minimum number of attacks needed to win. The function `min_attacks` takes an integer `H` representing the initial health of the monster, and returns the minimum number of attacks needed.\n\nThe input is read from standard input and converted to an integer with `int", "def solve(H):\n    return (H.bit_length() - 1) if H > 1 else 0\n\nH = int(input())\nprint(solve(H))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by using binary operations. If the health of the monster is greater than 1, Caracal needs to make the minimum number of attacks that is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the health minus 1. If the health of the monster is 1, Caracal doesn't need to make any attacks because the monster disappears right away. The `bit_length()` function is used to calculate the number of bits in the binary representation of a number.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses the `bit_length()` function, which has", "def solve(H):\n    return bin(H).count('1')\n\nH = int(input())\nprint(solve(H))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem is a typical problem of binary representation.\n\nThe minimum number of attacks Caracal needs to make is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of H.\n\nFor example, if H is 2, its binary representation is 10, which has two bits. So, Caracal needs to make two attacks.\n\nIf H is 3, its binary representation is 11, which has three bits. So, Caracal needs to make three attacks.\n\nThis is because each bit in the binary representation of a number represents a new monster with health equal to the index of the bit.

It then enters a loop where it checks if the health of the monster is even. If it is, it halves the health of the monster and increments the number of attacks by 1. If the health of the monster is odd, it subtracts 1 from the health of the monster and increments the number of attacks by 1. This loop continues until the health of the monster is"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nCaracal is fighting with a monster.\nThe health of the monster is H.\nCaracal can attack by choosing one monster. When a monster is attacked, depending on that monster's health, the following happens:\n - If the monster's health is 1, it drops to 0.\n - If the monster's health, X, is greater than 1, that monster disappears.
