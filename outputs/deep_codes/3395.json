It offers many different paths to victory but you prefer the blood-and-fire-strategy: build as many soldiers as possible and club your opposition into submission.

The rules for moving from one cell to another are rather complicated: if you can move from cell A to cell B, it does not always mean that you can also move from B to A. For example, if two cells are connected by a river, then you may be able to move downstream, but not upstream, so long as you didn\u2019t invent a steam engine; however, it still could be possible to reach the upstream cell by using roads and taking a detour over other cells.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you own only one such cell, where all your settlers are located. At every move you are allowed to move an arbitrary number of settlers from a cell to one of its accessible neighbours.

However, there is no need to leave a settler in your initial cell because it is where your palace is located and thus the cell stays claimed for all time.\n\nYour goal is to claim at least one cell containing the resource \u201ciron ore\u201d and at least one cell with resource \u201ccoal\u201d in order to be able to build soldiers.
