For each combination, it checks if the total number of legs matches the input Y. If it does, it prints 'Yes' and exits.

The inner loop then iterates over all possible numbers of turtles (from 0 to X-i, where i is the number of cranes).

If it's not even, it's impossible for the statement to be true, so we print 'No' and exit.\n\nNext, we check if the number of legs is at least twice the number of animals. If it's not, it's impossible for the statement to be true, so we print 'No' and exit.\n\nFinally, we check if the number of legs is at most four times the number of animals. If it's not, it's impossible for the statement to be true, so we print 'No' and exit.\n\nIf all these checks pass, we print 'Yes' to indicate that there is a combination of numbers of cranes and turtles in which the statement is correct", "X, Y = map(int, input().split())\nif Y % 2 == 0 and 2 * X <= Y <= 4 * X:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe statement \"there are X animals in total in the garden, and they have Y legs in total\" is correct if there are X/2 cranes and X/2 turtles (since each crane has 2 legs and each turtle has 4 legs). Therefore, the number of turtles must be between X and 2X (inclusive), and the number of legs must be between 2X and 4X (inclusive). This can be expressed as Y must be an even number and 2X <= Y <= 4X.\n\nThe Python code first reads X and Y from the input, and then checks if Y is an even number and if 2X <= Y <= 4X. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.", "X, Y = map(int, input().split())\n\nfor cranes in range(X+1):\n    turtles = X - cranes\n    if cranes * 2 + turtles * 4 == Y:\n        print('Yes')\n        exit()\n\nprint('No')\n\nIn this code, we use a for loop to iterate through possible numbers of cranes. For each number of cranes, we calculate the number of turtles. We then check if the total number of legs matches the expected number Y. If we find a match, we print 'Yes' and exit the program. If we don't find a match after checking all possible numbers of cranes, we print 'No'.\n\nThis code assumes that the total number of legs is always even, which is the case for the given problem. If the total number of legs could be odd, we would need to add an additional check to see if the total number of legs is odd.", "X, Y = map(int, input().split())\n\nfor i in range(X+1):\n    for j in range(X+1-i):\n        if 2*i + 4*j == Y:\n            print('Yes')\n            exit()\n\nprint('No')\n\nThis Python code works by iterating over all possible combinations of cranes and turtles.
