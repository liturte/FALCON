It sorts the list of cards, then it iterates over the list to find the minimum difference between the sums of cards taken by Snuke and Raccoon. The difference is calculated as the difference between the sum of cards taken by Raccoon (which is the sum of all cards minus the sum of cards taken by Snuke) and the sum of cards taken by Snuke. The minimum difference is the result.\n\nThe time complexity", "def min_difference():\n    N = int(input())\n    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    cards.sort()\n    return min(cards[i+1]-cards[i] for i in range(N-2))\n\nprint(min_difference())\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution works by first sorting the list of cards. This will make the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the cards smallest. After that, it iterates over the sorted list of cards, calculating the difference between each pair of neighboring cards. It then returns the smallest of these differences, which is the minimum possible value of |x-y|.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the correct format,", "N = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(sum(a[i+1:])-sum(a[:i+1]) for i in range(N-1)))\n\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the list of card values. Then it calculates the difference between the sum of the values on the cards that Snuke takes and the sum of the values on the cards that Raccoon takes for each possible number of cards that Snuke can take. The minimum of these differences is the minimum possible value of |x-y|.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N log N) because of the sorting step.
