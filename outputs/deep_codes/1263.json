To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. \n\nDima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it.

In other words, $\\frac{\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} a_{j}}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_{j}} = k$ , where a_{j} is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and b_{j} is its calories.\n\nInna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle?
