The second line is a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ integers $0 \\leq t_ i \\leq 50000000$, the positions of all notes in milliseconds. Then follow $p$ lines containing two integers each, $0 \\leq s_ i < e_ i \\leq 50000000$, the positions of the start and end of the $i$\u2019th Star Power phrase.\n\nNotes are guaranteed to exist on the start and end positions of each SP phrase. SP phrases never overlap and are given in ascending order.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe maximum score as a single integer.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 1\n0 10 20\n0 10\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 1\n0 10 20 26 40 50\n0 40\nSample Output 2:\n9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
