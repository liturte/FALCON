It\u2019s terminal based, but a bit friendlier to new users who can\u2019t remember the commands they typed before. Fish can use your history of commands for command completion: pressing up (\u201c^\u201d) finds the last command you ran that shares the prefix you have already typed (a string is a prefix of itself).\n\nIf you press up again you go another step back in time, finding the second last command that shares the prefix of what you typed. If there are no more matching commands you stay at the oldest matching command.\n\nWhen a series of consecutive up-presses is ended, either by typing some other character or by pressing enter to run the current command, the matching command from the history replaces everything that was typed in the current input.\n\nWhen you press enter the current input is added to the command history. The command history does not contain up-characters (\u201c^\u201d) since command completion is always performed before the enter-key is processed.\n\nThe input to this problem contains the characters a user typed in a fish terminal, separated into lines. After each line, the user pressed enter. Your task is to output the resulting command history.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single number $n$, where $1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$.\n\nThen follows $n$ lines with the user input.
