The function `solve` takes two arguments `s` and `x`. It checks if `s` is less than `x`, if they are equal and if `s` minus `x` is less than `x`, in all these cases it returns 0. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 2. The input is read from the standard input, split into two numbers and they are passed to the `solve` function. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution works because the bitwise XOR operation can only produce a result if the two numbers have different bit patterns in the same position.

If they are, there are no solutions. Then it counts the number of set bits in the binary representation of the difference between the sum and XOR. This is the number of different bits in the numbers a and b. The total number of solutions is 2 to the power of this count.\n\nIt then reads the input, splits it into two integers, and passes these to the function.

If s < x, there are no solutions because a and b cannot be both positive.\n\n2. If s == x, there is one solution if x is even and no solution if x is odd. This is because for a bitwise XOR of two numbers to be 0, both numbers must be even.\n\n3. If s - x =="], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTwo positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x.
