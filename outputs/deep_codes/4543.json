It does this by converting the concatenated integer to a string, squaring it, and comparing it to the original integer. If the squared integer matches the original integer, the number is a square number.\n\nThis code uses the built-in `str` function to convert the integers to strings, the `int` function to convert the strings back to integers, and the `**` operator to square the number. It uses a helper function `is_square` to check if a number is a square number.\n\nThe result of the check is printed to standard output, either 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for errors.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport sys\n\na, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\ndef is_square(n):\n    return n == int(n ** 0.5) ** 2\n\nprint('Yes' if is_square(int", "import sys\n\na, b = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\nc = int(str(a) + str(b))\nprint('Yes' if c ** 0.5 == int(c ** 0.5) else 'No')\n\n\nThis program reads the input, concatenates the two numbers into a single integer, and then checks if that number is a perfect square by taking its square root and comparing it to its integer value. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square, and the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not perform any error checking. If the input is not correctly formatted, the program may not work as expected.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the ** operator for exponentiation, which in Python is equivalent to raising to a power. The 0.5 argument to this operator is equivalent to taking the square root. The == operator is used to compare the square root to its integer value.", "import sys\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n# Concatenate a and b\nc = int(str(a) + str(b))\n\n# Check if the square root of c is an integer\nif math.sqrt(c).is_integer():\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code first reads the input from the standard input.

If you want to handle invalid input cases, you need to add appropriate error handling code.\n\nAlso, this solution uses the `**` operator for exponentiation, which is equivalent to raising a number to a power.
