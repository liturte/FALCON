Next query is a fight with monster which can kill character in 20 seconds and has 50 health points. Vova kills it in 10 seconds (spending 100 mana). Next monster has 52 health, so Vova can't deal that much damage with only 100 mana.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
