The process of a tournament is described in the next paragraph.\n\nThere are n toy cars. Each pair collides. The result of a collision can be one of the following: no car turned over, one car turned over, both cars turned over. A car is good if it turned over in no collision. The results of the collisions are determined by an n \u00d7 n matrix \u0410: there is a number on the intersection of the \u0456-th row and j-th column that describes the result of the collision of the \u0456-th and the j-th car:    - 1: if this pair of cars never collided.  - 1 occurs only on the main diagonal of the matrix.  0: if no car turned over during the collision.  1: if only the i-th car turned over during the collision.  2: if only the j-th car turned over during the collision.  3: if both cars turned over during the collision. \n\nSusie wants to find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you cope with the task?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of cars.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains n space-separated integers that determine matrix A. \n\nIt is guaranteed that on the main diagonal there are  - 1, and  - 1 doesn't appear anywhere else in the matrix.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input is correct, that is, if A_{ij} = 1, then A_{ji} = 2, if A_{ij} = 3, then A_{ji} = 3, and if A_{ij} = 0, then A_{ji} = 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of good cars and in the next line print their space-separated indices in the increasing order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n-1 0 0\n0 -1 1\n0 2 -1\n\nOutput\n2\n1 3 \nInput\n4\n-1 3 3 3\n3 -1 3 3\n3 3 -1 3\n3 3 3 -1\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
