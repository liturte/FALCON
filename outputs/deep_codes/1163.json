It reads the number of boys and girls from the input, then prints a string of \"B\"s and \"G\"s to represent the boys and girls. The number of \"B\"s is the number of boys, and the number of \"G\"s is the number of girls.\n\nThis solution is optimal because it always alternates between boys and girls as much as possible.

They should stand in a line so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 to n + m. Then the number of integers i (1 \u2264 i < n + m) such that positions with indexes i and i + 1 contain children of different genders (position i has a girl and position i + 1 has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible. \n\nHelp the children and tell them how to form the line.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100), separated by a space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a line of n + m characters. Print on the i-th position of the line character \"B\", if the i-th position of your arrangement should have a boy and \"G\", if it should have a girl. \n\nOf course, the number of characters \"B\" should equal n and the number of characters \"G\" should equal m. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n\nOutput\nGBGBGB\n\nInput\n4 2\n\nOutput\nBGBGBB\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample another possible answer is BGBGBG. \n\nIn the second sample answer BBGBGB is also optimal.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
