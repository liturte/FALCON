As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph G with the following properties:   G has exactly n vertices, numbered from 1 to n.  For all pairs of vertices i and j, where i \u2260 j, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters s_{i} and s_{j} are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \n\nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph G, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string s, such that if Vasya used this s he would produce the given graph G.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m $(1 \\leq n \\leq 500,0 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2})$\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i})\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph G.

So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"cc\" meets the graph's conditions. \n\nIn the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
