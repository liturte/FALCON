{"4351": {"code": ["N = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code takes an input N and converts it to a string. Then it checks if the string is equal to its reverse (obtained by slicing with a step of -1). If it is, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nThis is a common way to solve this problem in Python, but you could also solve it in a different way if you prefer.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be a valid integer in the range specified by the problem constraints. If you want to add error checking for this, you could add an if statement at the start of the code to check if N is in the range 100 to 999.", "N = input()\nif N == N[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code reads the input number, reverses it using slicing, and checks if it is equal to the original number. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.", "N = input()\nif N == N[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nIn this code, we first take input N. Then we check if N is equal to its reverse. If they are equal, then N is a palindromic number, so we print 'Yes'. If they are not equal, then N is not a palindromic number, so we print 'No'.\n\nNote: The [::-1] slice is used to reverse the string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is a string. If the input is an integer, you may need to convert it to a string first.\n\n\n\nN = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n\n\n\n\n\nN = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\n\nN = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\n\nN = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:", "N = int(input())\nif str(N) == str(N)[::-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis program works by first converting the input number to a string. It then checks if the string is the same when read backward (`str(N)[::-1]`) as forward. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. If not, it prints 'No'.\n\nIn Python, `str(N)[::-1]` is a neat trick to reverse a string. It works by slicing the string from start to end with a step of -1, which means \"go backwards one step at a time\".\n\nThis solution is fast and simple, but it assumes that the input will always be a three-digit number. If the input could be more than three digits, you would need to add additional code to handle that.\n\nThis solution also doesn't check if the input is a positive integer. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you would need to add additional error checking code.", "N = input()\nprint('Yes' if N == N[::-1] else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by reading the input number N, then reversing it (N[::-1]) and comparing it to the original N.
