It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer. But because this example is symmetric, we can choose almost the same spanning tree but with vertex $5$ instead of $2$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
