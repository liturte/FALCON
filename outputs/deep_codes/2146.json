Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of n intersections numbered from 1 to n. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections. Walking from intersection number i to intersection j requires |i - j| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections p_1 = 1, p_2, ..., p_{k} is equal to $\\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1}|p_{i} - p_{i + 1}$ units of energy.\n\nOf course, walking would be boring if there were no shortcuts. A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly n shortcuts in Mike's city, the i^{th} of them allows walking from intersection i to intersection a_{i} (i \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 a_{i} + 1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection.

For example, if Mike chooses a sequence p_1 = 1, p_2 = a_{p}_1, p_3 = a_{p}_2, ..., p_{k} = a_{p}_{k} - 1, he spends exactly k - 1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home.
