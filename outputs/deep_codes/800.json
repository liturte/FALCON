The check goes like that: there is a plane with mannequins standing on it. You should tell the value of the minimum angle with the vertex at the origin of coordinates and with all mannequins standing inside or on the boarder of this angle. \n\nAs you spend lots of time \"glued to the screen\", your vision is impaired. So you have to write a program that will pass the check for you.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of mannequins.\n\nNext n lines contain two space-separated integers each: x_{i}, y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| \u2264 1000) \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th mannequin. It is guaranteed that the origin of the coordinates has no mannequin. It is guaranteed that no two mannequins are located in the same point on the plane.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the value of the sought angle in degrees. The answer will be considered valid if the relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n2 0\n0 2\n\nOutput\n90.0000000000\n\nInput\n3\n2 0\n0 2\n-2 2\n\nOutput\n135.0000000000\n\nInput\n4\n2 0\n0 2\n-2 0\n0 -2\n\nOutput\n270.0000000000\n\nInput\n2\n2 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n36.8698976458\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nSolution for the first sample test is shown below:  [Image] \n\nSolution for the second sample test is shown below:  [Image] \n\nSolution for the third sample test is shown below:  [Image] \n\nSolution for the fourth sample test is shown below:  $\\#$\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
