The ASCII values of lowercase and uppercase English alphabet characters are sequential, so we can use these facts to determine whether a character is uppercase or lowercase and to shift it by the specified amount. The modulus operator is used to ensure that the shift wraps around at the end of the alphabet.\n\n\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input().strip())\n\nres = \"\"\nfor c in s:\n    if c.isupper():\n        res += chr((ord(c) - 65 + n) % 26 + 65)\n    else:\n        res += chr((ord(c) - 97 + n) % 26 + 97)\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string only contains letters of the English alphabet. If the string could contain other characters, the solution would need to be modified to handle those cases.\n\n\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(", "def shift_letters(s, n):\n    return ''.join(chr((ord(c) - 65 + n) % 26 + 65) if c.isupper() else chr((ord(c) - 97 + n) % 26 + 97) if c.islower() else c for c in s)\n\ns = input()\nn = int(input())\nprint(shift_letters(s, n))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `shift_letters` takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `c` in `s`. If `c` is an uppercase letter, it shifts it `n` positions in the alphabet and wraps around using the modulus operator. If `c` is a lowercase letter, it does the same but with the ASCII values of lowercase letters. If `c` is neither a letter, it is left unchanged. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string with `join()` before being returned. The input string and shift number are read from the user, and the resulting string is printed.\n\nNote: The ASCII values of uppercase and lowercase letters are 65-90 and 97-122, respectively. So, shifting them by `n` positions in the alphabet is equivalent to adding `n` to their ASCII values, and wrapping around at 26.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input string is a valid English sentence and does not handle any potential errors.\n\nNote: This code is written in Python.", "s = input()\nn = int(input())\n\nresult = \"\"\nfor char in s:\n    if char.isupper():\n        result += chr((ord(char) - 65 + n) % 26 + 65)\n    else:\n        result += chr((ord(char) - 97 + n) % 26 + 97)\n\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase, it subtracts 65 from its ASCII value to convert it to a number between 0 and 25 (inclusive), adds the shift amount, takes the modulus of 26 to ensure it's still within the 0-25 range, and then adds 65 back to convert it back to an uppercase letter. If the character is lowercase, it does the same but with 97 instead of 65 to convert it to a number between 0 and 25.\n\nThis solution assumes that the shift amount is always non-negative. If the shift amount could be negative, you would need to add 26 before taking the modulus to ensure it's still within the 0-25 range.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input string only contains letters. If it could contain other characters, you would need to handle them separately.\n\nPlease note that this solution does not handle the case where the shift amount is larger than the number of letters in the alphabet. In this case, the modulus operation will wrap around and the result will be incorrect.", "s = input()\nn = int(input())\nprint(''.join([c.upper() if i % n == 0 else c.lower() for i, c in enumerate(s, 1)]))\n\n\nThis solution uses list comprehension to iterate over the input string. The `enumerate()` function is used to get both the index (i) and the character (c) at each position in the string. The `%` operator is used to determine whether the index is a multiple of `n`. If it is, the character is converted to uppercase; otherwise, it is converted to lowercase. The `join()` function is used to concatenate the characters back into a string.\n\nPlease note that the index starts from 1, not 0, so the first character is at position 1, not 0.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input string only contains letters and does not contain any other characters. If this is not the case, you may need to add error checking code to handle non-alphabet characters.\n\nThe `upper()` and `lower()` methods are used to convert characters to uppercase and lowercase respectively.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses Python 3.x syntax and features. If you are using a different programming language, the solution might be different.\n\nLastly, please note that the problem statement and the examples provided in the question are ambiguous.

The `join` method is used to concatenate the characters back into a string.\n\nPlease note that the position in the string starts from 1, not 0. So if n is 3, the 3rd character, 6th character, 9th character, etc. will be uppercase.\n\nThe input and output strings are case sensitive, i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.\n\nAlso, this program doesn't handle the case where n is 0. If n is 0, all characters will be in lowercase.\n\nPlease adjust the program according to your needs.\n\n\n-----Hints-----\nThe % (modulo) operator can be used to determine if a number is divisible by another number.\nThe join() method can be used to concatenate a sequence of strings.\nThe enumerate() function can be used to iterate over a sequence and have access to the index of each element.\nThe lower() and upper() methods can be used to convert a string to lowercase or uppercase, respectively.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\n\ndef solve(s, n):\n    return ''.join(c.lower() if i % n else c"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\n[Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input is a string (between 1 and 50 characters long, inclusive).
