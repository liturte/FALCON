The store has $k$ types of packages: the package of the $i$-th type consists of exactly $i$ shovels ($1 \\le i \\le k$). The store has an infinite number of packages of each type.\n\nPolycarp wants to choose one type of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly $n$ shovels?\n\nFor example, if $n=8$ and $k=7$, then Polycarp will buy $2$ packages of $4$ shovels.\n\nHelp Polycarp find the minimum number of packages that he needs to buy, given that he:   will buy exactly $n$ shovels in total;  the sizes of all packages he will buy are all the same and the number of shovels in each package is an integer from $1$ to $k$, inclusive. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then, $t$ test cases follow, one per line.\n\nEach test case consists of two positive integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$) and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of shovels and the number of types of packages.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ answers to the test cases. Each answer is a positive integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of packages.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n8 7\n8 1\n6 10\n999999733 999999732\n999999733 999999733\n\nOutput\n2\n8\n1\n999999733\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe answer to the first test case was explained in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case, there is only one way to buy $8$ shovels\u00a0\u2014 $8$ packages of one shovel.\n\nIn the third test case, you need to buy a $1$ package of $6$ shovels.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
