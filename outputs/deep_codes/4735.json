This means that the remainder of the year divided by 26 will determine the month. If the remainder is 4 or 11, there is an optimal launch window. So we use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the year divided by 26, and return \"yes\" if the remainder is either 4 or 11, otherwise return \"no\".\n\nNote: This assumes that the month of the optimal launch window is always April or November. If the month could", "y = int(input())\nif (y - 2018) % 26 == 0 or (y - 2018) % 26 == 1:\n    print('yes')\nelse:\n    print('no')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe optimal launch windows occur every 26 months. If the difference between the current year and 2018 is divisible by 26, or is one less than a multiple of 26, then there is an optimal launch window. The '%' operator is used to get the remainder of the division, which is 0 if the difference is a multiple of 26, and 1 if it is one less than a multiple of 26.\n\nThis program takes the input year,", "print(\"yes\" if int(input()) % 26 in [4, 7, 10, 13] else \"no\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe optimal launch windows occur in April, July, October, and January. So, the months that are divisible by 26 are April (4th month), July (7th month), October (10th month), and January (13th month). We check if the input year is divisible by 26 and if the remainder is in the list [4, 7, 10, 13]. If it is, we print \"yes\", otherwise \"no\".\n\nNote: The months are 0-indexed, so the 4th month is actually the 3rd month", "print(\"yes\" if int(input()) % 26 == 4 else \"no\")\n\n\nThis python code checks if the year entered is divisible by 26 and if the remainder is 4. If it is, it prints \"yes\" meaning there is an optimal launch window in that year, if not it prints \"no\".\n\nThis works because the optimal launch window is in April, which is the 4th month, so the remainder of the year when divided by 26 gives us the month of the year. If the remainder is 4, that means the optimal launch window happens in April.\n\nThis code assumes that the months of the year are numbered from 0 to 11, with January being 0 and December being 11.\n\nThis code also", "y = int(input())\nif (y - 2018) % 26 == 0:\n    print(\"yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"no\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is very simple. It takes the year as input and subtracts 2018. It then checks if the result is divisible by 26. If it is, then there is an optimal launch window in the year. Otherwise, there is not. The modulo operator (%) is used to check for divisibility.\n\nThis solution assumes that the launch windows occur in April each year. If the launch windows occur at different months, then the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the engineers have calculated the optimal launch"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are an eccentric billionaire with an affinity for sending stuff to Mars. In an ideal world you would send stuff to Mars all the time, but your engineers tell you that it is most efficient to do it when Earth and Mars are somewhat close to each other. \n\nYour engineers have calculated that optimal launch windows occur once every 26 months, and that one of them occurs in April 2018. They also tell you that they will not have any Big Finished Rockets by then, so you will have to wait for a later launch window.\n\nSince your rocket scientists apparently can not be bothered to tell you about the optimal launch windows before it is too late, you have to keep track of that yourself.
