His friends are going to buy a string consisted of round brackets since Famil Door loves string of brackets of length n more than any other strings!\n\nThe sequence of round brackets is called valid if and only if:   the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets;  for any prefix of the sequence, the number of opening brackets is greater or equal than the number of closing brackets. \n\nGabi bought a string s of length m (m \u2264 n) and want to complete it to obtain a valid sequence of brackets of length n. He is going to pick some strings p and q consisting of round brackets and merge them in a string p + s + q, that is add the string p at the beginning of the string s and string q at the end of the string s.\n\nNow he wonders, how many pairs of strings p and q exists, such that the string p + s + q is a valid sequence of round brackets. As this number may be pretty large, he wants to calculate it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains n and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, n - m \u2264 2000)\u00a0\u2014 the desired length of the string and the length of the string bought by Gabi, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains string s of length m consisting of characters '(' and ')' only.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of pairs of string p and q such that p + s + q is a valid sequence of round brackets modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 1\n(\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4 4\n(())\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 3\n(((\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample there are four different valid pairs:   p = \"(\", q = \"))\"  p = \"()\", q = \")\"  p = \"\", q = \"())\"  p = \"\", q = \")()\" \n\nIn the second sample the only way to obtain a desired string is choose empty p and q.\n\nIn the third sample there is no way to get a valid sequence of brackets.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
