You also have a house, which you model as an axis-aligned rectangle with diagonally opposite corners at the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. You want to pick a length of rope that guarantees the goat cannot reach the house.\n\nDetermine the minimum distance from the fence post to the house, so that you can make sure to use a shorter rope.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing six space-separated integers $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, and $y_2$, each in the range $[-999, 999]$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $x_1 < x_2$ and $y_1 < y_2$, and that $(x, y)$ is strictly outside the axis-aligned rectangle with corners at $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum distance from the goat\u2019s post to the house, with a relative or absolute error no more than $0.001$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n7 3 0 0 5 4\nSample Output 1:\n2.0\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 0 0 2 7 6\nSample Output 2:\n2.0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
