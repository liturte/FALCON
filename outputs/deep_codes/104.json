He will train for $n$ days, all days are numbered from $1$ to $n$, beginning from the first.\n\nOn the $i$-th day Polycarp will necessarily solve $a_i$ problems. One evening Polycarp plans to celebrate the equator. He will celebrate it on the first evening of such a day that from the beginning of the training and to this day inclusive he will solve half or more of all the problems.\n\nDetermine the index of day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$) \u2014 the number of days to prepare for the programming contests.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10\\,000$), where $a_i$ equals to the number of problems, which Polycarp will solve on the $i$-th day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n6\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the second day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve $4$ out of $7$ scheduled problems on four days of the training.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the third day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve $6$ out of $12$ scheduled problems on six days of the training.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
