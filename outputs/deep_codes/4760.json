Then for each number `x` from 2 to `n`, if `x` is not crossed out (i.e., `sieve[x]` is 0), it marks all multiples of `x` as crossed out by incrementing the corresponding elements in the `sieve` list. It does this by iterating over the list with step `x` and incrementing the count for each number that `x` divides. Finally, it returns the number that has been crossed out `", "def sieve(n, k):\n    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))\n    index = 0\n    while len(numbers) > k:\n        p = numbers[index]\n        numbers = [x for x in numbers if x == p or x % p != 0]\n        index += 1\n    return numbers[k - 1]\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(sieve(n, k))\n\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to filter out the multiples of each prime number. It then returns the $K$-th number that remains in the list. The input is read using Python's built-in `input()` function, which reads a line of text from the user, and `map()` is used to convert this line of text into two integers. These are stored in the variables `n` and `k`. The `sieve()` function is then called with these two arguments, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nNote: The indices in the list start at 0, so when we return the $K$-", "def sieve(n, k):\n    numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))\n    counter = 0\n    while numbers:\n        p = numbers[0]\n        for i in range(p - 1, len(numbers), p):\n            counter += 1\n            if counter == k:\n                return numbers[i]\n            numbers[i] = None\n        numbers = [x for x in numbers if x is not None]\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(sieve(n, k))\n\n\nThis program uses a sieve of Eratosthenes-like approach to find the k-th number to be crossed out in the range 2 to n. It initializes a list of numbers from 2 to n. Then, it enters a loop that continues until all numbers have been crossed out. Inside the loop, it finds the smallest number not yet crossed out, crosses out all of its multiples, and increments a counter. If the counter equals k, it returns the current number. Otherwise, it removes the crossed out numbers from the list and continues.
