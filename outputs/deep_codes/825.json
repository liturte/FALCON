It starts by initializing a variable `i` to 2 (the smallest prime number), and a counter `count` to 0. It then enters a loop that continues as long as `i` squared is less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i` by 1. If `n` is divisible"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is a positive integer N.
