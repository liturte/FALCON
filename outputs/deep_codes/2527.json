Dilku loves Bhopu and he writes a message : \u201ciloveyou\u201d\non paper and wishes to send it to Bhopu. As Dilku is busy making an artwork, he asks his friend Raj to send the message to Bhopu. However Raj has a condition that he may add/remove some  characters and jumble the letters of the message.\nAs Bhopu understands Dilku, she can read \u201ciloveyou\u201d from the message if all the characters of the string \u201ciloveyou\u201d are in the message received by her. Bhopu is happy if she can read \u201ciloveyou\u201d from the message. Otherwise, she is sad. Tell whether Bhopu is happy or sad.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput contains a string S, where S is the message received by Bhopu. String S consists of only lowercase letters.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201chappy\u201d if Bhopu is happy and \u201csad\u201d if Bhopu is sad.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100\nWhere |S| denotes length of message string S\n\n-----Example-----\nInput 1:\niloveyou\n\nOutput 1:\nhappy\n\nInput 2:\nulrvysioqjifo\n\nOutput 2:\nsad\n\nInput 3:\nabcvleouioydef\n\nOutput 3:\nhappy\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
