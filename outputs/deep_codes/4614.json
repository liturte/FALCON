If they are, it prints the third one, which is different. If not, it prints the first one, which is different.\n\nThis solution is correct because it checks all possible cases and handles all possible inputs.\n\nIt's important to note that this solution assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., three integers between -100 and 100. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nAlso, note that the order of the numbers in the if-elif-else statement is important. The code will return the first number that meets the condition and will not check the rest. This is why the order matters.", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A == B:\n    print(C)\nelif A == C:\n    print(B)\nelse:\n    print(A)\n\n\nThis program reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. It then checks if A and B are the same, if so, it prints C. If not, it checks if A and C are the same, if so, it prints B. If neither A and B nor A and C are the same, it prints A.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be three different integers.

If they are, it prints C. If not, it checks if A and C are the same and prints B if they are. If neither of these are true, it means A and B are different, so it prints A.\n\nThis is a very efficient solution because it only requires one pass through the inputs and three simple comparisons. It also avoids the need for any loops or additional data structures, making it very readable and efficient.\n\nIt also handles the case where all three numbers are the same correctly, as it will print the same number in this case.\n\nFinally, it satisfies the constraints because all inputs are integers between -100 and 100, and the input is correctly formatted.", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A == B:\n    print(C)\nelif A == C:\n    print(B)\nelse:\n    print(A)\n\n\nThis python code reads three integers A, B and C from the input, then compares them. If A and B are the same, it prints the third one C. If A and C are the same, it prints the second one B. If neither A nor B are the same with C, it prints A.\n\nIt does not need any explanation because it is a straightforward implementation of the problem statement.\n\nIt works under the condition that all three inputs are integers between -100 and 100, as stated in the problem statement.\n\nIt assumes that the input will be in the correct format and within the specified range.\n\nIt does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur if the inputs are not in the correct format or range.\n\nIt is also assumed that the input will always be provided in the correct format and within the specified range.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# print(int(input()) ^ int(input()) ^ int(input()))\n\n# xor (^) is a bitwise operator in python.
