It then compares the two strings lexicographically and prints the smaller one.\n\nIn Python, the '<' operator can be used to compare strings lexicographically. This works by comparing the first unequal characters in the strings. If the strings are equal, the shorter string is considered to be smaller.\n\nIn this case, we are generating two strings of the form 'xxx' and 'yyy', where 'x' and 'y' are the digits a and b respectively. The string 'xxx' is smaller than 'yyy' if 'x' is smaller than 'y'. Therefore, the smaller string is the one that would be generated by repeating the smaller digit the appropriate number of times.\n\nThis program uses the map function to convert the input into integers, and the split function to split the input into two parts. It then uses the < operator to compare the two", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(str(a)*b if a<b else str(b)*a)\n\n\nThis code works by taking two integers `a` and `b` as input, and then it prints the smaller of the two strings formed by concatenating `a` copies of `b` and `b` copies of `a`. It does this by using the `str` function to convert the integers to strings, and then the `*` operator to repeat the string. The `if` statement then compares the two resulting strings and prints the one that comes first lexicographically.\n\nFor example, if `a` is 4 and `b` is 3, it would print `3333`. If `a` is 3 and `b` is 4, it would print `3333` as well. If `a` and `b` are the same, it would print `a*b` or `b*a` as both are same.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input line into two integers, and the `split` method is used to split the line into parts wherever a space is found.\n\nThe `if` statement is used to compare the two strings and print the smaller one. If `a` is less", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(str(a)*b if a<b else str(b)*a)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads two integers a and b from the input. Then it compares the integers and prints the smaller one between the strings formed by concatenating a copies of the digit b and b copies of the digit a respectively. The '*' operator is used to repeat a string a or b times. The 'if a<b else' part is a conditional expression that returns the first value if the condition is true, and the second value if the condition is false.\n\nThis solution assumes that the lexicographically smaller string is the one that would come first when read from left to right.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input is always valid and does not need any error checking.\n\nThis solution is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to read and write. It's one of the most popular programming languages, especially for tasks like this one.\n\nPlease note that the code provided does not contain any explanatory comments or explanations. It's a pure code solution to the problem.", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(str(a)*b if a < b else str(b)*a)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. Then it checks if `a` is less than `b`. If this is true, it prints `a` repeated `b` times; otherwise, it prints `b` repeated `a` times.\n\nThe `str()` function is used to convert the integers into strings, and the `*` operator is used to repeat the string. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works in O(1) time and O(1) space.\n\nIt's important to note that in Python, the `<` operator compares the ASCII values of the strings lexicographically. Thus, `str(a)*b` is lexicographically smaller if `a < b`, and `str(b)*a` is lexicographically smaller if `b < a`.\n\nThe `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings at each space character, and the `map()` function applies the `int()` function to each substring, converting them into integers.\n\nFinally, the", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(str(a)*b if a < b else str(b)*a)\n\n\nThis code reads two integers a and b from the input, then it prints the lexicographically smaller of the two strings. If a is less than b, it prints a string of a repeated b times; otherwise, it prints a string of b repeated a times.\n\nFor example, if a = 4 and b = 3, it prints 444. If a = 3 and b = 4, it prints 3333.\n\nThis code uses the ternary operator to simplify the if-else statement. It's equivalent to:\n\n\nif a < b:\n    print(str(a)*b)\nelse:\n    print(str(b)*a)\n\n\nBoth codes print the lexicographically smaller of the two strings.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nThis is a solution in Python.
