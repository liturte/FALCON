Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.\n\nWe define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.\n\nYou are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l \u2264 a, b \u2264 r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a \u2260 b.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 y \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the only integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer for the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 12 1 12\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n50 100 3 30\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\nIn the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).\n\nIn the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l \u2264 a, b \u2264 r.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
