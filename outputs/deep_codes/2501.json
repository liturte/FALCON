To prevent the stolen secret from being handed to AlDebaran Kingdom, you have sneaked into the party where the transaction happens.\nThere are N attendees in the party, and they are given attendee numbers from 1 through N. The height of Attendee i is A_i.\nAccording to an examination beforehand, you know that a pair of attendees satisfying the condition below will make the transaction.\n - The absolute difference of their attendee numbers is equal to the sum of their heights.\nThere are \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} ways to choose two from the N attendees and make a pair. Among them, how many satisfy the condition above?\nP.S.: We cannot let you know the secret.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq N)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\dots A_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of pairs satisfying the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\n2 3 3 1 3 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\n - A_1 + A_4 = 3, so the pair of Attendee 1 and 4 satisfy the condition.\n - A_2 + A_6 = 4, so the pair of Attendee 2 and 6 satisfy the condition.\n - A_4 + A_6 = 2, so the pair of Attendee 4 and 6 satisfy the condition.\nNo other pair satisfies the condition, so you should print 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
