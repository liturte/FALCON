However, it might not be valid at the moment. The professor asks you to check if it is possible to make the sequence valid by performing at most one segment inversion operation. That is, you may choose two 1-based indices $l$ and $r$ ($1~ \\leq ~ l~ \\leq ~ r~ \\leq ~ n$) and invert each bracket with an index in the closed interval $[l,r]$. After the inversion, a left bracket \u2018(\u2019 becomes a right bracket \u2018)\u2019, and a right bracket \u2018)\u2019 becomes a left bracket \u2018(\u2019.\n\nYou can make \u201c())(\u201d valid by inverting the segment $[3,4]$. You can make \u201c()))\u201d valid by inverting the segment $[3,3]$, or alternatively by inverting the segment $[2,2]$. However, there does not exist a segment you can invert to make \u201c)))(\u201d valid.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of one line containing between $1$ and $5000$ brackets.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cpossible\u201d if you can make the bracket sequence valid by performing at most one segment inversion, or \u201cimpossible\u201d otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n()))\nSample Output 1:\npossible\n\nSample Input 2:\n)))(\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
