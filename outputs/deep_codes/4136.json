{"4136": {"code": ["a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a + b)\n\n\nThis code reads the input, splits it into two numbers, adds them together, and then prints the result.\n\nHere, `map(int, input().split())` is used to read the input and split it into two numbers. `int()` is used to convert each part of the input to an integer. The result is a tuple of two integers, which is unpacked into the variables `a` and `b`. Finally, `a + b` is used to add the two numbers together and `print()` is used to print the result.\n\nThis code should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a + b)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code first takes two integers as input separated by a space. Then it calculates the sum of these two integers and prints the result.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"5 14\", the output will be \"19\". If the input is \"381 492\", the output will be \"873\".\n\nNote: The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element in the input string, which turns them into integers. The `split` function separates the input string into parts at each space, and the `print` function prints the result.\n\nAlso, the input and output values are between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), so this problem is suitable for beginners.", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a + b)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code takes two integers as input from the user, adds them together, and then prints the result. The `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings whenever it encounters a space. The `print` function then prints the result.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle any potential errors that might occur if the input is not in the correct format.\n\nThis is a simple and straightforward solution to the problem. It should be accepted by any contest platform that accepts Python code.\n\nYou can test this code by copying it into a Python environment and running it with the desired input. The output will be printed to the console.", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a + b)", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a + b)\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThis code reads two integers from the input, adds them together and outputs the result. The `map()` function is used to convert the input strings into integers, and `input().split()` is used to split the input string into two parts.\n\nThe `print()` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis code should be accepted by most contest platforms.\n\n-----Notes-----\nThe problem is not too difficult, but it is good to know how to read input and output in Python.\n\nThe input and output are separated by a single space, and the input is read as a string. The `split()` function is used to split this string into two parts, and `map()` is used to convert these parts into integers. The sum of these integers is then calculated and printed.\n\nThis code is simple and should work on most platforms, but it is always a good idea to check the constraints. In this case, the maximum value for a and b is 1000, so the sum of a and b can be at most 2000, which should not cause any problems.\n\nIf you are using a different programming language, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\n-----Example-----\nIf you input \"5 14\", the code will split this into two parts: \"5\" and \"14\". These are then converted to integers, and added together. The result, 19, is then printed.\n\nIf you input"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA + B is often used as an example of the easiest problem possible to show some contest platform. However, some scientists have observed that sometimes this problem is not so easy to get accepted. Want to try?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains two integers a and b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^3), separated by a single space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the sum of the given integers.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 14\n\nOutput\n19\n\nInput\n381 492\n\nOutput\n873\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
