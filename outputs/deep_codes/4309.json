The loop continues until the set of digits in `N` is of size 1, meaning all digits are the same. The final value of `N` is then printed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\ndef find_earliest_abc(N):\n    while len(set(str(N))) != 1:\n        N += 1\n    return N\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(find_earliest_abc(N))\n\n\nThis code will solve the problem. The function `find_earliest_abc` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut. The code then reads an integer `N` from the standard input, calls `find_earliest_abc` with `N` as argument, and prints the result.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\ndef find_earliest_abc(N):\n    while len(set(str(N))) != 1:", "N = int(input())\n\nwhile len(set(str(N))) != 1:\n    N += 1\n\nprint(N)\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer N from the standard input, and then keeps incrementing N until all the digits of N in base ten are the same. The first such value of N is then printed to the standard output.\n\nThe set() function is used to remove duplicate digits from the string representation of N, and the len() function is used to count the number of remaining digits. If the number of remaining digits is not 1, the program increments N and repeats the process.\n\nNote: The problem statement seems to be a bit ambiguous. If \"earliest ABC\" refers to the smallest N that meets the condition, then the provided solution is correct. However, if \"earliest ABC\" refers to the largest N that meets the condition, then the program needs to start from N and decrement N instead of incrementing it.\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\"\"\"\n\nN = int(input())\n\nwhile len(set(str(N))) != 1:\n    N += 1\n\nprint(N)\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer N from the", "print(int(input()))\n\n\nThis solution simply reads the input and prints it out. Since the input is guaranteed to be a number with all its digits the same, this is the earliest ABC where Kurohashi can make his debut.\n\nThis is a very simple problem and does not require any complex programming.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 100, the first digit of `n` will be at least 1, and so the earliest ABC where all the digits are the same as the first digit of the next ABC is the next ABC where all the digits of the ABC are 1.
