The any() function returns True if at least one element of the iterable is True, and False otherwise. In this case, it checks if there exists some combination of cakes and doughnuts that sum up to exactly N dollars. The range of cakes and doughnuts is from 0 to N/4 and N/7 respectively, because you can't buy more than N/4 cakes and N/7 doughnuts. The condition in the any() function checks if there exists some combination of cakes and doughnuts that will give you exactly N dollars, while the - 5*c - 2*d >= 0 condition ensures that you can buy at least zero cakes and zero doughnuts.\n\nThis code works by iterating over all possible combinations of cakes and doughnuts, and checking if any combination satisfies the condition. If any combination does, it prints 'Yes'. If no combination does, it prints 'No'."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLa Confiserie d'ABC sells cakes at 4 dollars each and doughnuts at 7 dollars each.\nDetermine if there is a way to buy some of them for exactly N dollars.
