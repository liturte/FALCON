So"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAll of you are probably very familiar with the problem of finding the longest monotone subsequence. You probably think you know all about it. In order to convince us, solve the problem \u201copposite\u201d to finding the longest monotone subsequence.\n\nFor given $N$ and $K$, find a sequence that consists of numbers from $1$ to $N$ such that each of the numbers in it appears exactly once and the length of its longest monotone subsequence (ascending or descending) is exactly $K$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 10^6$), the length of the sequence and the required length of the longest monotone subsequence.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the required sequence doesn\u2019t exist, output $-1$ in the first and only line.\n\nIf the required sequence exists, output the required sequence of $N$ numbers in the first and only line. Separate the numbers with a single space.\n\nThe required sequence (if it exists) is not necessarily unique, so you can output any valid sequence.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\nSample Output 1:\n1 4 2 3\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 1\nSample Output 2:\n-1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
