All the presents can be divided into two types: medals and cups. Bizon the Champion has a_1 first prize cups, a_2 second prize cups and a_3 third prize cups. Besides, he has b_1 first prize medals, b_2 second prize medals and b_3 third prize medals. \n\nNaturally, the rewards in the cupboard must look good, that's why Bizon the Champion decided to follow the rules:  any shelf cannot contain both cups and medals at the same time;  no shelf can contain more than five cups;  no shelf can have more than ten medals. \n\nHelp Bizon the Champion find out if we can put all the rewards so that all the conditions are fulfilled.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers a_1, a_2 and a_3 (0 \u2264 a_1, a_2, a_3 \u2264 100). The second line contains integers b_1, b_2 and b_3 (0 \u2264 b_1, b_2, b_3 \u2264 100). The third line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes) if all the rewards can be put on the shelves in the described manner. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n4\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n1 1 3\n2 3 4\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n1\n\nOutput\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
