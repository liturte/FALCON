The tree contains three leaves: 3, 4 and 5. If we put the maximum number 3 at node 3, then the first player moves there and the result will be 3. On the other hand, it is easy to see that for any rearrangement the first player can guarantee the result of at least 2.\n\nIn the second sample no matter what the arragment is the first player can go along the path that ends with a leaf with number 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
