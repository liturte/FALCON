When the courier delivered the pizza, he was very upset, because several pieces of sausage lay on the crust, and he does not really like the crust.\n\nThe pizza is a circle of radius r and center at the origin. Pizza consists of the main part \u2014 circle of radius r - d with center at the origin, and crust around the main part of the width d. Pieces of sausage are also circles. The radius of the i\u00a0-th piece of the sausage is r_{i}, and the center is given as a pair (x_{i}, y_{i}).\n\nGleb asks you to help determine the number of pieces of sausage caught on the crust. A piece of sausage got on the crust, if it completely lies on the crust.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst string contains two integer numbers r and d (0 \u2264 d < r \u2264 500)\u00a0\u2014 the radius of pizza and the width of crust.\n\nNext line contains one integer number n\u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces of sausage (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nEach of next n lines contains three integer numbers x_{i}, y_{i} and r_{i} ( - 500 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 500, 0 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 500), where x_{i} and y_{i} are coordinates of the center of i-th peace of sausage, r_{i}\u00a0\u2014 radius of i-th peace of sausage.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the number of pieces of sausage that lay on the crust.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 4\n7\n7 8 1\n-7 3 2\n0 2 1\n0 -2 2\n-3 -3 1\n0 6 2\n5 3 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n10 8\n4\n0 0 9\n0 0 10\n1 0 1\n1 0 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nBelow is a picture explaining the first example.
