We just need to find the difference between the maximum and the minimum of A, B, and C. The minimum number of operations is the difference.\n\nThis solution works because we can always make A, B, and C equal by repeatedly performing the operations:\n - Increase two of them by 1.\n - Increase one of them by 2.\nSo, the minimum number of operations is the difference between the maximum and the minimum of A, B, and C.\n\nThis solution works in O(1) time because it takes constant time to compute the minimum and maximum of three numbers.\n\nThis solution is correct because it always produces the minimum number of operations that can be performed to make A, B, and C equal.\n\nThis solution is also efficient because it does not require any sort", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\n\nans = min(A, B, C)\nA += B - min(A, B)\nB += C - min(B, C)\nC += A - min(A, C)\n\nans += (A + B + C) // 3\n\nprint(ans)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code first finds the minimum of A, B, C and adds it to the answer. Then it increases the other two numbers by the difference between their current value and the minimum value. This ensures that the three numbers are now equal. Finally, it adds the number of operations needed to make the three numbers equal to the answer. This is done by dividing the sum of the three numbers by 3 (since each operation increases each number by 1 or 2, and we need to make each number equal to the minimum number of 3 operations).\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be valid", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\n\ncount = min(A, B, C)\nA += B + C - min(A, B, C) * 3\nB += A + C - min(A, B, C) * 3\nC += A + B - min(A, B, C) * 3\n\nwhile A != B or B != C:\n    if A > B or A > C:\n        if B > C:\n            A -= B - C\n            B = C\n        else:\n            A -= C - B\n            B = A\n    elif B > A or B > C:\n        if A > C:\n            B -= A - C\n            A = C\n        else:\n        B -= C - A\n            A = B\n    count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis code works by first ensuring that the", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A, B, C) - min(A, B, C))\n\n\nThis solution works by first converting the input into three variables A, B, and C. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum of these three numbers. This difference is the minimum number of operations required to make A, B, and C equal.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be three integers between 0 and 50 inclusive. If this is not the case, additional error checking would need to be added.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input will always be in the format specified in the problem statement. If this is not the case, additional error checking would need to be added.\n\nFinally, this solution is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. It's a good choice for this problem because it's simple and efficient.\n\nPlease", "def min_operations(A, B, C):\n    operations = 0\n    while A != B or B != C:\n        if A < B and A < C:\n            A += 2\n            operations += 1\n        elif B < A and B < C:\n            B += 2\n            operations += 1\n        elif C < A and C < B:\n            C += 2\n            operations += 1\n        else:\n            if A == B:\n                A += 1\n                C += 1\n                operations += 1\n            elif B == C:\n                B += 1\n                A += 1\n                operations += 1\n            elif C == A:\n                C += 1\n                B += 1\n                operations += 1\n    return operations\n\nA, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_operations(A, B, C))\n\n\nThis code first defines a function `min_operations"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given three integers A, B and C.
