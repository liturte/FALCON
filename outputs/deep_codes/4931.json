The scale A is Y degrees warmer than scale B at a point X. Therefore, to find a point where the two scales are the same, we need to solve the equation:\n\nX = (1 - 1 / Y) * T\n\nwhere T is the temperature on scale B. Solving for T gives:\n\nT = X / (1 - 1 / Y)\n\nThis Python code does exactly that.\n\nPlease note", "def solve(X, Y):\n    if Y == 1:\n        return X\n    else:\n        return -X\n\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(X, Y))\n\n\nThis code is a solution to the problem. It takes two inputs X and Y from the user. If Y is 1, it returns X. Else, it returns -X. This is because for every change of 1 degree in B, there are Y changes in A. So to get 0 on scale B, we need to move A by X/Y degrees. Since we are moving A by -X/Y degrees, we need to move B by -(-X/Y) = X", "def solve(X, Y):\n    return X / (Y - 1)\n\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(X, Y))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is a simple linear equation. The scale B is Y times larger than scale A. Therefore, to convert a temperature in B to a temperature in A, we divide by Y. The point where the two scales are the same is when the two temperatures are the same, so we solve the equation for X / (Y - 1) = 0.\n\nThe solution is X / (Y - 1). This is the temperature where the two scales are the same.\n\nNote: The problem statement mentions that the", "def solve():\n    X, Y = map(int, input().split())\n    if Y == 1:\n        print('ALL GOOD')\n    elif X % Y == 0:\n        print(-X)\n    else:\n    print('IMPOSSIBLE')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find a temperature where two scales are the same. The scale B is Y degrees higher than scale A for every one degree increase in A. So, to find the temperature where both scales are the same, we need to make sure that the temperature on scale B is equal to the negative of the temperature on scale A.\n\nIf Y is 1, it means that for every one degree increase in A,", "def find_same_temp(X, Y):\n    # The equation for the scales A and B is:\n    # A = X + (B - 32) * Y\n    # So, to find the temperature where both scales are the same, we need to solve this equation for B:\n    # A = B\n    # We know that A is the point on B where it is zero, which is X.\n    # And we know that a change of a single degree in A corresponds to a change of Y degrees in B.\n    # So we can rewrite the equation as:\n    # X = B - 32 * Y\n    # Solving for B gives us the temperature where both scales are the same."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nHello from the future. I am a time traveller. You would think that in the future we have agreed to use a single scale for measuring temperature. This is not so. In fact, we have all sorts of scales now. All the big brands have made their own. This is a bit confusing. Please help me figure it out. In my day to day work I have to relate to two different scales $A$ and $B$. Help me find a temperature where the two scales are the same, so I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of two space-separated integers, $X$ and $Y$. $X$ is the point on $B$ where $A$ is zero. $Y$ is the number of degrees in $B$ that equal a change of a single degree in $A$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the temperature where both scales are the same. This number must have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$. If no such temperature exists, output \u201cIMPOSSIBLE\u201d (without the quotes) instead. If more than one such point exists, output \u201cALL GOOD\u201d (without the quotes) instead.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $-100 \\leq X \\leq 100$\n - $1 \\leq Y \\leq 100$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n32 2\nSample Output:\n-32\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
