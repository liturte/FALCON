Let's assume that Misha chose number m, and Andrew chose number a.\n\nThen, by using a random generator they choose a random integer c in the range between 1 and n (any integer from 1 to n is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player, whose number was closer to c. The boys agreed that if m and a are located on the same distance from c, Misha wins.\n\nAndrew wants to win very much, so he asks you to help him. You know the number selected by Misha, and number n. You need to determine which value of a Andrew must choose, so that the probability of his victory is the highest possible.\n\nMore formally, you need to find such integer a (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n), that the probability that $|c - a|<|c - m|$ is maximal, where c is the equiprobably chosen integer from 1 to n (inclusive).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the range of numbers in the game, and the number selected by Misha respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 such value a, that probability that Andrew wins is the highest. If there are multiple such values, print the minimum of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n4 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 2 or 3. The probability that Andrew wins is 2 / 3. If Andrew chooses a = 3, the probability of winning will be 1 / 3. If a = 1, the probability of winning is 0.\n\nIn the second sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 1 and 2. The probability that Andrew wins is 1 / 2. For other choices of a the probability of winning is less.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
