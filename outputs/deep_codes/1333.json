The first task is drawing a fox! However, that turns out to be too hard for a beginner, so she decides to draw a snake instead.\n\nA snake is a pattern on a n by m table. Denote c-th cell of r-th row as (r, c). The tail of the snake is located at (1, 1), then it's body extends to (1, m), then goes down 2 rows to (3, m), then goes left to (3, 1) and so on.\n\nYour task is to draw this snake for Fox Ciel: the empty cells should be represented as dot characters ('.') and the snake cells should be filled with number signs ('#').\n\nConsider sample tests in order to understand the snake pattern.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers: n and m (3 \u2264 n, m \u2264 50). \n\nn is an odd number.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput n lines. Each line should contain a string consisting of m characters. Do not output spaces.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n\nOutput\n###\n..#\n###\n\nInput\n3 4\n\nOutput\n####\n...#\n####\n\nInput\n5 3\n\nOutput\n###\n..#\n###\n#..\n###\n\nInput\n9 9\n\nOutput\n#########\n........#\n#########\n#........\n#########\n........#\n#########\n#........\n#########\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
