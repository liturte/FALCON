It first reads the input data from the user, which includes the number of contests Takahashi has participated in and his Displayed Rating. It then checks if Takahashi has participated in 10 or more contests. If he has, it prints his Displayed Rating as his Inner Rating. If he hasn't, it calculates his Inner Rating by adding 100 times the difference between 10 and the number of contests he has participated in to his Displayed", "N, R = map(int, input().split())\nprint(R + 100 * (10 - N) if N < 10 else R)\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `input().split()` function to read the input, which splits the input on whitespace by default. The `map()` function is used to convert each split string into an integer. The `if` statement then checks whether the number of contests is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the Displayed Rating as the Inner Rating minus 100 times the difference between 10 and the number of contests. If the number of contests is 10 or more, it simply uses the Displayed R", "N, R = map(int, input().split())\nif N >= 10:\n    print(R)\nelse:\n    print(R + 100 * (10 - N))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem can be solved by checking if Takahashi has participated in 10 or more contests. If he has, his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating. Otherwise, his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus 100 times the difference between 10 and the number of contests he has participated in. The code does exactly this, using Python's built-in input and print functions, and the conditional if-else statement.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef solve(N, R):", "N, R = map(int, input().split())\nif N >= 10:\n    print(R)\nelse:\n    print(R + 100 * (10 - N))\n\n\nThis code reads the number of contests and the displayed rating from the input, and then prints the inner rating. If the number of contests is 10 or more, the inner rating is the same as the displayed rating. Otherwise, the inner rating is the displayed rating plus 100 times the difference between 10 and the number of contests.", "N, R = map(int, input().split())\nif N >= 10:\n    print(R)\nelse:\n    print(R + 100 * (10 - N))\n\n\nThis code works by first checking if Takahashi has participated in 10 or more contests. If he has, his Displayed Rating is equal to his Inner Rating, so we simply print his Inner Rating as given. If he has participated in less than 10 contests, we calculate his Inner Rating by adding 100 times the difference between 10 and the number of contests he has participated in to his Displayed Rating.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be in the correct format as"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi is a member of a programming competition site, ButCoder.\nEach member of ButCoder is assigned two values: Inner Rating and Displayed Rating.\nThe Displayed Rating of a member is equal to their Inner Rating if the member has participated in 10 or more contests.
