{"780": {"code": ["QUESTION:\nSuppose you have a special $x$-$y$-counter. This counter can store some value as a decimal number; at first, the counter has value $0$. \n\nThe counter performs the following algorithm: it prints its lowest digit and, after that, adds either $x$ or $y$ to its value. So all sequences this counter generates are starting from $0$. For example, a $4$-$2$-counter can act as follows:  it prints $0$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $4$, and the output is $0$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $8$, and the output is $04$;  it prints $8$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $12$, and the output is $048$;  it prints $2$, and adds $2$ to its value, so the current value is $14$, and the output is $0482$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $18$, and the output is $04824$. \n\nThis is only one of the possible outputs; for example, the same counter could generate $0246802468024$ as the output, if we chose to add $2$ during each step.\n\nYou wrote down a printed sequence from one of such $x$-$y$-counters.
