It then calculates the number of elements that need to be removed by summing the maximum of 0 and the difference between the count of a number and the number itself. The result is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the sequence a", "import collections\nN = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na_counter = collections.Counter(a)\n\n# count numbers which appear more than their value\ninvalid_numbers = [k for k, v in a_counter.items() if k < v]\n\n# count how many numbers need to be removed to make them invalid\nremoved = sum([v - k for k, v in a_counter.items() if k > v])\n\n# count how many invalid numbers can be removed to make the sequence good\nremoved += sum([v * (v - k) for k, v", "from collections import Counter\n\nN = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncounter = Counter(a)\nremovals = sum(max(0, counter[x] - x) for x in counter)\nprint(removals)\n\n\nThis solution works by using the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each number in the list. Then, it calculates the number of removals needed by iterating over each number x in the counter and subtracting the count of x from x (if x is less than the count of x, it subtracts", "from collections import Counter\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = Counter(A)\nprint(sum(max(0, v - k) for k, v in c.items()))\n\n\nThis Python solution uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the number of occurrences of each number in the sequence. It then calculates the total number of elements that need to be removed by summing the maximum of zero and the difference between the count of a number and the number itself. The result is printed to standard output.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a sequence of positive integers of length N, a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_N).\nYour objective is to remove some of the elements in a so that a will be a good sequence.\nHere, an sequence b is a good sequence when the following condition holds true:\n - For each element x in b, the value x occurs exactly x times in b.\nFor example, (3, 3, 3), (4, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4) and () (an empty sequence) are good sequences, while (3, 3, 3, 3) and (2, 4, 1, 4, 2) are not.\nFind the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed so that a will be a good sequence.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - a_i is an integer.\n - 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed so that a will be a good sequence.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n3 3 3 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nWe can, for example, remove one occurrence of 3.
