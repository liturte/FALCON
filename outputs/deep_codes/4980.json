Every time he meets up with his programming team, he wears his hot pink team hoodie over a salmon colored shirt with shirt buttons in a dashing rose or pink shade. Of course, he can\u2019t show up to two training sessions with the same buttons on his shirt, that would cause unbearable ridicule. If he can\u2019t find buttons for this perfect color combination, he will come up with some poor excuse for not showing up. He has a box full of different colored buttons in labeled packages. Unfortunately, Thore is color blind, so his helpful daughter has labeled each package with the color of the buttons. Her writing is terrible though, she mixes uppercase and lowercase arbitrarily and has no spacing between words, so Thore needs your help to decipher the names on the labels and select buttons with either \u201cpink\u201d or \u201crose\u201d somewhere in the name, ignoring case. \n\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with an integer $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$, the number of button packages in the box. The following $N$ lines each has a color name, one for each package. The names consist of up to 30 characters of letters A - Z, a - z.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer, the number of training sessions Thore can attend. If he can\u2019t attend any session because there are no pink buttons, output his standard excuse \u201cI must watch Star Wars with my daughter\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n12\npink\ntequilaSunrose\nmExicanPInK\nCoquelicot\nturqrose\nroSee\nJETblack\npink\nbabypink\npInKpinkPinK\nPInkrose\nlazerlemon\nSample Output:\n9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
