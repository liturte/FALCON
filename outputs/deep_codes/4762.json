If there are n people, there are n-1 ways to give a gift (not to yourself), and there are n total ways to distribute the hats. So the probability of not giving a gift to yourself is (n-1)/n. The probability of giving a gift to yourself is 1 - the probability of not giving a gift to yourself.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that there is a 1 in n", "def santa_chance(n):\n    return 1 - (n-1)/n\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(santa_chance(n))\n\nThis python program calculates the probability of a Secret Santa draw resulting in at least one person giving a gift to themselves. The probability of a draw resulting in no self-gifts is `(n-1)/n`, so the probability of at least one self-gift is `1 - (n-1)/n`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the probability of a person giving a gift to themselves is independent for each person. In reality, this is not the case because the probability of a person giving a gift to themselves would depend on the names already drawn.\n\nThe input and output", "def solve(N):\n    return 1 - (N-1)/N\n\nN = int(input().strip())\nprint(\"{:.8f}\".format(solve(N)))\n\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the probability of a Secret Santa giving a gift to themselves is 1 minus the probability of everyone not giving a gift to themselves. The probability of everyone not giving a gift to themselves is the number of ways everyone can choose someone other than themselves to give a gift divided by the total number of ways to choose a gift giver. This is calculated as (N-1)/N.\n\nThe solve function takes an integer N as input and returns the probability that one or more people will wind up giving gifts to themselves. The result is then printed to the console with 8 decimal", "def solve(N):\n    return 1 - (N-1)/N\n\nN = int(input().strip())\nprint(\"{:.8f}\".format(solve(N)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem can be solved by calculating the probability of drawing a name from the hat without replacement. The probability of drawing a name is the number of remaining names divided by the total number of names. In the case of Secret Santa, there are N names in the hat, and each person draws one name at random, so the probability of drawing a name is 1/N. Since we're looking for the probability of drawing the same name, we subtract this from 1 to get the probability of drawing a different name.\n\nFor each person, the probability of drawing a different name", "def solve(n):\n    return 1 - ((n-1)/n)**n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(solve(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe probability of not getting a gift to yourself is `(n-1)/n` because there are `n-1` other people and one of them is guaranteed to not get a gift. This probability is then taken to the power of `n` because each of the `n` people is choosing their gift from `n` possibilities. The total number of ways to give gifts is `n` choose `n` (which is 1) and the number of ways to not give a gift to yourself is `n-1` choose `n` (which is `(n-1)/n`)."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nChristmas comes sooner every year. In fact, in one oft-forgotten corner of the world, gift-giving has already started in the form of a Secret Santa syndicate.\n\nEverybody in the small town of Haircombe is going to put their name into a hat. This hat will be given a hearty shuffle, and then afterwards everybody will take turns once more in taking a name back from the hat.\n\nThe name each person receives is the name of the fellow citizen to whom they will send a gift.\n\nOf course, one concern with this strategy is that some unfortunate citizens could wind up giving gifts to themselves. What are the chances that this will happen to any of the citizens of Haircombe?\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing the number $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^{12}$), the number of citizens who will take part in Secret Santa.\n\n-----Output-----\n - One line containing one real number; the probability that one or more people wind up giving gifts to themselves.\n\nAll output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\nSample Output 1:\n0.50000000\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\nSample Output 2:\n0.66666667\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
