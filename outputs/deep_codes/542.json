The wrestler who gets the most points wins.\n\nWhen the numbers of points of both wrestlers are equal, the wrestler whose sequence of points is lexicographically greater, wins.\n\nIf the sequences of the awarded points coincide, the wrestler who performed the last technique wins. Your task is to determine which wrestler won.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains number n \u2014 the number of techniques that the wrestlers have used (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5). \n\nThe following n lines contain integer numbers a_{i} (|a_{i}| \u2264 10^9, a_{i} \u2260 0). If a_{i} is positive, that means that the first wrestler performed the technique that was awarded with a_{i} points. And if a_{i} is negative, that means that the second wrestler performed the technique that was awarded with ( - a_{i}) points.\n\nThe techniques are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the first wrestler wins, print string \"first\", otherwise print \"second\"\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1\n2\n-3\n-4\n3\n\nOutput\nsecond\n\nInput\n3\n-1\n-2\n3\n\nOutput\nfirst\n\nInput\n2\n4\n-4\n\nOutput\nsecond\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nSequence x  =  x_1x_2... x_{|}x| is lexicographically larger than sequence y  =  y_1y_2... y_{|}y|, if either |x|  >  |y| and x_1  =  y_1,  x_2  =  y_2, ... ,  x_{|}y|  =  y_{|}y|, or there is such number r (r  <  |x|, r  <  |y|), that x_1  =  y_1,  x_2  =  y_2,  ... ,  x_{r}  =  y_{r} and x_{r}  +  1  >  y_{r}  +  1.\n\nWe use notation |a| to denote length of sequence a.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
