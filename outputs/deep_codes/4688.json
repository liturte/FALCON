The number of ways to choose 2 colors from K is (K * (K - 1)) which gives us the number of ways to color the first ball. For the remaining (N - 1) balls, we can choose from K - 1 colors because we can't use the color used for the first ball. Thus, we raise (K - 1) to the power of (N - 1) and multiply it by (K - 1) to get the total number of ways to color all the balls.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the problem statement does not mention any restrictions on the number of ways to color the first ball. In other words, we can color the first ball in any of the K colors. If there was a restriction, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso note that the answer is always less than 2^31 because the number of ways to color the balls is a non", "def paint_balls(N, K):\n    MOD = 10**9+7\n    if N == 1:\n        return K\n    dp = [[0]*K for _ in range(N+1)]\n    for i in range(K):\n        dp[1][i] = 1\n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1]\n        dp[i][i-1] = dp[i-1][i-2]\n        for j in range(1, i-1):\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD\n    return sum(dp[N]) % MOD\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(paint_balls(N, K))\n\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

For the remaining N-1 balls, we have K-1 choices for each of them. The number of ways to do this is (K-1) * (K-1)^(N-1). Since we need to calculate this modulo 10^9+7, we use the pow() function with three arguments: pow(a, b, mod). This calculates a^b modulo mod.\n\nNote: The pow() function in python performs exponentiation by squaring which makes it much faster than naive exponentiation.\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The transitions are to paint the i-th ball in any of", "MOD = 1000000007\n\ndef powmod(a, b):\n    r = 1\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            r = (r * a) % MOD\n        b = b // 2\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n    return r\n\ndef solve(n, k):\n    return (powmod(k, n) - powmod(k - 1, n) + MOD) % MOD\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, k))\n\n\nThis code first defines a function powmod to calculate a to the power of b modulo MOD. Then it defines another function solve to calculate the number of ways to paint the balls. The number of ways is calculated as the difference between the result of powmod(k, n) and powmod(k - 1, n) plus MOD to ensure the result is positive. The main part of the code reads the input, calls the solve function with the input values, and prints the result.", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 10**9+7\nprint((K-1)*(K)**(N-1) % MOD)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe total number of ways to paint N balls is K^N.\nHowever, for any two adjacent balls to be painted in different colors, we need to subtract the number of ways where the first two balls are painted in the same color. This is because we have K choices for the first ball and K-1 choices for the second ball (because the first ball can't be painted the same color as the second).\nSo the total number of ways to paint the balls is (K-1)*K^(N-1).\nWe use modulo operation to avoid overflow.\n\nThis solution works because it uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion, where we subtract the cases where some balls are painted in the same color to get the total number of ways.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1).\n\nThis solution works for N and K up to 1000, as required."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are N balls placed in a row.\nAtCoDeer the deer is painting each of these in one of the K colors of his paint cans.\nFor aesthetic reasons, any two adjacent balls must be painted in different colors.\nFind the number of the possible ways to paint the balls.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266N\u22661000\n - 2\u2266K\u22661000\n - The correct answer is at most 2^{31}-1.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of the possible ways to paint the balls.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nWe will denote the colors by 0 and 1.
