Then he would get Q(x) =  - 10 - 9x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) =  - 10 - 18 - 12 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_2 =  - 8. Then Q(x) = 10 - 9x - 8x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 18 - 32 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_1 =  - 19. Then Q(x) = 10 - 19x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 38 - 12 + 40 = 0. \n\nIn the second sample, we are given the same polynomial. This time though, k is equal to 12 instead of 10^9. Two first of ways listed above are still valid but in the third way we would get |a_1| > k what is not allowed. Thus, the answer is 2 this time.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
