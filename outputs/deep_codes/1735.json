When a character is equal to the character at the top of the stack, it is removed from the stack. If it is not equal, it is added to the stack. The player who is able to make the last turn wins. If the stack is empty, the first player wins, otherwise the second player wins.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

If it ever finds a character that is the same as the last, it increments the count. If it finds a character that is different, it resets the count to 1. If the count reaches 3, it returns False, indicating that the first player will lose.

If there are any consecutive equal characters, the first player will lose, otherwise the second player will lose.\n\nThis code is based on the fact that the first player will always have an advantage in this game because they can always remove two consecutive equal characters in a turn, while the second player will always have to wait for the first player to make a turn"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTwo people are playing a game with a string $s$, consisting of lowercase latin letters. \n\nOn a player's turn, he should choose two consecutive equal letters in the string and delete them. \n\nFor example, if the string is equal to \"xaax\" than there is only one possible turn: delete \"aa\", so the string will become \"xx\". A player not able to make a turn loses.\n\nYour task is to determine which player will win if both play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains the string $s$, consisting of lowercase latin letters ($1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100\\,000$), where $|s|$ means the length of a string $s$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the first player wins, print \"Yes\".
