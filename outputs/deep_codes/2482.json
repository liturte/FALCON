There are also K roads and L railways, extending between the cities.\nThe i-th road bidirectionally connects the p_i-th and q_i-th cities, and the i-th railway bidirectionally connects the r_i-th and s_i-th cities.\nNo two roads connect the same pair of cities. Similarly, no two railways connect the same pair of cities.\nWe will say city A and B are connected by roads if city B is reachable from city A by traversing some number of roads. Here, any city is considered to be connected to itself by roads.\nWe will also define connectivity by railways similarly.\nFor each city, find the number of the cities connected to that city by both roads and railways.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \u2266 N \u2266 2*10^5\n - 1 \u2266 K, L\u2266 10^5\n - 1 \u2266 p_i, q_i, r_i, s_i \u2266 N\n - p_i < q_i\n - r_i < s_i\n - When i \u2260 j, (p_i, q_i) \u2260 (p_j, q_j)\n - When i \u2260 j, (r_i, s_i) \u2260 (r_j, s_j)\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K L\np_1 q_1\n:\np_K q_K\nr_1 s_1\n:\nr_L s_L\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint N integers. The i-th of them should represent the number of the cities connected to the i-th city by both roads and railways.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1 2 2 1\n\nAll the four cities are connected to each other by roads.\nBy railways, only the second and third cities are connected. Thus, the answers for the cities are 1, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
