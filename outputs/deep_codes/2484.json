In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 \\leq k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even.\nFor example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 0 \\leq A_i < 2^{20}\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 ... A_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of the pairs of integers l and r (1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq N) that satisfy the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n2 5 4 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\n(l,r)=(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4) clearly satisfy the condition.\n(l,r)=(1,2) also satisfies the condition, since A_1\\ xor\\ A_2 = A_1\\ +\\ A_2 = 7.\nThere are no other pairs that satisfy the condition, so the answer is 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
