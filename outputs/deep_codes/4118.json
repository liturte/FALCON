Each cell has a number written on it. The numbers on the cells are different from each other.\n\nTakahashi is standing on the cell 1 and he wants to reach the cell N. In one step, he can move to any of the cells that have a number written on them. Takahashi can move to a cell i from a cell j if and only if the numbers written on the cells i and j are co-prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nTakahashi wants to know if it's possible for him to reach the cell N. If it's possible, find the minimum number of steps", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A <= 20 and B <= 20:\n    print(A * B)\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code reads two integers from input, A and B. It then checks if both are less than or equal to 20. If they are, it multiplies A and B and prints the result.

It then checks if A and B are between 1 and 20 (inclusive). If they are, it prints A*B. If not, it prints -1.\n\nThis code is written in Python and is a straightforward solution to the problem. It uses the built-in map function to split the input into two integers, and the input function to get the input from the user. It then uses conditional statements to check if the input is within the specified range and prints the result accordingly.\n\nThe code is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good solution for the problem.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement. If the input format is different, the code may not work correctly.\n\nAlso note that the code does not handle errors or exceptions. If the input is not a number, the code will throw an error. If you want to handle such cases, you can add error handling code.\n\nThis code is written in Python. If you want to write it in a different programming language, you will need to modify", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A <= 20 and B <= 20:\n    print(A*B)\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n\n\nThe code reads two integers A and B from the input. It checks if both A and B are less than or equal to 20. If true, it multiplies A and B and prints the result. If not, it prints -1.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input is always in the correct format as mentioned in the constraints. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add some error checking to make sure the input is valid.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that the multiplication table for integers between 1 and 20 (inclusive) is complete, so Takahashi can always calculate A \\times B if A and B are both between 1 and 20.\n\nThis code uses the built-in `map` function to read two integers from the input at once. The `split` method is used to split the input on whitespace, and the `int` function is used to convert the resulting strings to integers. The `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis code does not use any external libraries or modules, and runs in O(1) time, as it performs a constant number of operations regardless"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nHaving learned the multiplication table, Takahashi can multiply two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) together.
