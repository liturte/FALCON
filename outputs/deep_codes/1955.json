Then on the sixth day he should prepare for the exam number 2 and then pass it on the seventh day. After that he needs to prepare for the exam number 1 on the eighth day and pass it on the ninth day. \n\nIn the third example Vasiliy can't pass the only exam because he hasn't anough time to prepare for it.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
