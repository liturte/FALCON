Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.\n\nLittle X can pass only p levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only q levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264  n \u2264 100). \n\nThe next line contains an integer p (0 \u2264 p \u2264 n) at first, then follows p distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{p} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n). These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to n.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf they can pass all the levels, print \"I become the guy.\". If it's impossible, print \"Oh, my keyboard!\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n3 1 2 3\n2 2 4\n\nOutput\nI become the guy.\n\nInput\n4\n3 1 2 3\n2 2 3\n\nOutput\nOh, my keyboard!\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Little X can pass levels [1 2 3], and Little Y can pass level [2 4], so they can pass all the levels both.\n\nIn the second sample, no one can pass level 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
