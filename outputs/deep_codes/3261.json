The rows are numbered $0$ to $R-1$ top to bottom and the columns $0$ to $C-1$ left to right.\n\nWhat makes the board unusual is the way in which the cells are coloured. Each cell is either grey or white:\n - white, if the row and column numbers of the cell, when represented in binary, have at least one digit 1 in the same position. For example, the cell $(4, 5)$ would be white.\n - grey, otherwise. For example, the cell $(2, 5)$ would be grey.\n\nThe following image shows a board of size 10\u00b710. \n\nLuka\u2019s hedgehog likes walking on this unusual board and does it in an unusual way. The hedgehog starts his walk in the cell $(0, 0)$ and continues in the zig-zag pattern as in the second image above. While the hedgehog is walking, Luka counts how many grey squares it visited.\n\nAfter visiting $K$ squares, the hedgehog gets tired and falls asleep. Luka then goes to bed too, happy that he was able count the grey squares.\n\nKnowing the dimensions of the board and the number $K$ beforehand, however, it is possible to write a program that calculates the result faster. This is your task.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le 1000000$) and $C$ ($1 \\le C \\le 1000000$), the dimensions of the board.\n\nThe second line contains the integer $K$ ($1 \\le K \\le R \\cdot C$), the total number of squares the hedgehog visits.\n\nNote that this number may not fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of grey cells the hedgehog visits.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n10 10\n6\nSample Output 1:\n5\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 5\n11\nSample Output 2:\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
