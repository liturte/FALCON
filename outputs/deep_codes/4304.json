Then it calculates the depth of the snow cover by subtracting a from b, dividing by 2, and adding 1. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the depth of the snow cover is the same everywhere in the village, which means that the difference between the heights of the two towers is always an even number. Therefore, the depth of the snow cover is half of this difference, plus 1.\n\nThe input a and b are integers and are guaranteed", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b - a) // 2)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution works by directly calculating the depth of the snow cover. The depth is calculated by subtracting the height of the east tower from the height of the west tower, then dividing by 2. The result is the depth of the snow cover. The input is read from standard input, and the result is printed to standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is valid, i.e., that the heights of the towers are integers and that the depth of the snow cover is at least 1 meter. The solution also assumes that the height of the west tower is less than the height of", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b - a) // 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe depth of the snow cover is half the difference between the heights of the two towers. Since the heights of the towers are integers and the depth of the snow cover is also an integer, we divide the difference by 2 to get the depth. The '//' operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the correct format and that the depth of the snow cover will be at least 1 meter. The constraints are checked before the input is read, so there is no need to check them again", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((b - a) // 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe depth of the snow cover is the difference between the heights of the two towers divided by 2. Since the two towers are 1 meter apart, the snow cover is half of the difference in height between the two towers.\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the depth of the snow cover, and prints the result.\n\nIt's important to note that this solution assumes that the depth of the snow cover is always at least 1 meter, as stated in the problem statement.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it runs in constant time", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((a + b) // 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe depth of the snow cover is the average of the heights of the two towers.\nSo, we calculate the average by adding the heights of the two towers and dividing by 2.\nWe use integer division (//) to get an integer result.\nThis is because the depth of the snow cover cannot be a fraction of a meter.\n\n'''\n\n# Code\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    print((a + b) // 2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn some village, there are 999 towers that are 1,(1+2),(1+2+3),...,(1+2+3+...+999) meters high from west to east, at intervals of 1 meter.\nIt had been snowing for a while before it finally stopped.
