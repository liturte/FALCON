If we consider the number of integers from 1 to n that are not divisible by i for all i from 2 to 10, we can calculate it by subtracting from n the sum of the numbers of integers from 1 to n that are divisible by i. The sum of the numbers of integers from 1 to n that are divisible by i is n // i for all i from 2 to 10.\n\nThe python code implements this solution by defining a function count_numbers that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of integers from 1 to n that are not divisible by any i from 2 to 10. The function is then called with the input read from the standard input.\n\nPlease note that this solution", "def count_non_divisible(n):\n    count = n\n    for i in range(2, 11):\n        count -= n // i\n        for j in range(n // i + 1, n // 10 + 1):\n            if n % j < i:\n                count -= 1\n    return count\n\nprint(count_non_divisible(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program uses a function to calculate the number of numbers from 1 to n that are not divisible by any number from 2 to 10. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each number from 2 to 10, subtracting from the total count any numbers that are divisible by that number. If the number is divisible by a number in the range from n // 10 + 1 to n // i, another for loop is used to count the numbers that are divisible by that number but not by the current number being checked. If the remainder of the division of", "def count_non_divisible(n):\n    return n - sum(n // i for i in range(2, 11))\n\nprint(count_non_divisible(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find the count of numbers from 1 to n which are not divisible by any number from 2 to 10. This can be solved by subtracting the count of numbers which are divisible by 2 to 10 from n. The count of numbers which are divisible by 2 to 10 can be calculated by finding the quotient of n divided by each number from 2 to 10. The sum of these quotients gives the count of numbers which are divisible by 2 to 10. Subtracting this sum from n gives the count of numbers which are not divisible by 2 to 10.\n\nThis solution works because for each number i from 2 to 10, the quotient of n divided by i gives the count of", "def calculate_bonus(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 2 != 0 and i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 != 0 and i % 7 != 0 and i % 11 != 0 and i % 13 != 0 and i % 17 != 0 and i % 19 != 0 and i % 23 != 0 and i % 29 != 0 and i % 31 != 0 and i % 37 != 0 and i % 41 != 0 and i % 43 != 0 and i % 47 != 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(calculate_bonus(n))\n\n\nThis code first defines a function calculate_bonus(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns the count of numbers from 1 to n that are not divisible", "def count_non_divisible(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 2 != 0 and i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 != 0 and i % 7 != 0 and i % 11 != 0 and i % 13 != 0 and i % 17 != 0 and i % 19 != 0 and i % 23 != 0 and i % 29 != 0 and i % 31 != 0 and i % 37 != 0 and i % 41 != 0 and i % 43 != 0 and i % 47 != 0 and i % 53 != 0 and i % 59 != 0 and i % 61 != 0 and i % 67 != 0 and i % 71 != 0 and i % 73 != 0 and i % 79 != 0 and i %"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIT City company developing computer games decided to upgrade its way to reward its employees. Now it looks the following way. After a new game release users start buying it actively, and the company tracks the number of sales with precision to each transaction. Every time when the next number of sales is not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 every developer of this game gets a small bonus.\n\nA game designer Petya knows that the company is just about to release a new game that was partly developed by him. On the basis of his experience he predicts that n people will buy the game during the first month. Now Petya wants to determine how many times he will get the bonus.
