You recently decided to unify the file systems to the same type. That is quite a challenge since all the drives are currently in use, all of them are filled with important data to the limits of their capacities, and you cannot afford to lose any of the data. Moreover, reformatting a drive to use a new file system may significantly change the drive\u2019s capacity. To make the reformat possible, you will have to buy an extra hard drive. Obviously, you want to save money by minimizing the size of such extra storage.\n\nYou can reformat the drives in any order. Prior to reformatting a drive, you must move all data from that drive to one or more other drives, splitting the data if necessary. After a drive is reformatted, you can immediately start using it to store data from other drives. It is not necessary to put all the data on the same drives they originally started on \u2013 in fact, this might even be impossible if some of the drives have smaller capacity with the new file system. It is also allowed for some data to end up on the extra drive.\n\nAs an example, suppose you have four drives $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ with drive capacities $6$, $1$, $3$, and $3$ GB. Under the new file system, the capacities become $6$, $7$, $5$, and $5$\u00a0GB, respectively.
