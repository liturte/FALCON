This special offer can be used any number of times.\n\nVasya currently has $s$ roubles, and he wants to get as many chocolate bars for free. Each chocolate bar costs $c$ roubles. Help Vasya to calculate the maximum possible number of chocolate bars he can get!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nEach of the next $t$ lines contains four integers $s, a, b, c~(1 \\le s, a, b, c \\le 10^9)$ \u2014 the number of roubles Vasya has, the number of chocolate bars you have to buy to use the special offer, the number of bars you get for free, and the cost of one bar, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ lines. $i$-th line should contain the maximum possible number of chocolate bars Vasya can get in $i$-th test.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n10 3 1 1\n1000000000 1 1000000000 1\n\nOutput\n13\n1000000001000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test of the example Vasya can buy $9$ bars, get $3$ for free, buy another bar, and so he will get $13$ bars.\n\nIn the second test Vasya buys $1000000000$ bars and gets $1000000000000000000$ for free. So he has $1000000001000000000$ bars.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
