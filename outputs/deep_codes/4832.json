In taxicab geometry the distance between two points $T_1(x_1, y_1)$ and $T_2(x_2, y_2)$ is defined as:\\[ D(T_1,T_2) = \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right| + \\left|y_1 - y_2\\right| \\]\n\nAll other definitions are the same as in Euclidian geometry, including that of a circle:\n\nA circle is the set of all points in a plane at a fixed distance (the radius) from a fixed point (the centre of the circle).\n\nWe are interested in the difference of the areas of two circles with radius $R$, one of which is in normal (Euclidian) geometry, and the other in taxicab geometry. The burden of solving this difficult problem has fallen onto you.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input will contain the radius $R$, a positive integer smaller than or equal to $10000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOn the first line you should output the area of a circle with radius $R$ in normal (Euclidian) geometry. On the second line you should output the area of a circle with radius $R$ in taxicab geometry.\n\nNote: Outputs within $\\pm 0.0001$ of the official solution will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1\nSample Output 1:\n3.141593\n2.000000\n\nSample Input 2:\n21\nSample Output 2:\n1385.442360\n882.000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
