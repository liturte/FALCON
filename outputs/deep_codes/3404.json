While the Martians have skilled rocket tech, they lag behind in number theory considerably, which compromises their encryption protocol.\n\nFortunately for you, spies friendly to you have reverse engineered the Martian protocol. It turns out that the Martians are using a shift-based cipher combined with a very long one-time pad. More specifically, the decryption procedure works as follows:\n\nStep 1: Define the function $f(x) = (33x + 1) \\mod 2^{20}$.\n\n\nFurther define $f^1(x) = f(x)$, \u00a0$f^2(x) = f(f(x))$, \u00a0$f^3(x) = f(f(f(x)))$, and so on.\n\nStep 2: Create a $X$ by $X$ size grid, fill the upper left corner with $f^1(0)$, the next cell to the right with $f^2(0)$, $f^3(0)$ etc. Once the top row is filled, continue to the cell below the upper left cell, and fill with $f^{X+1}(0)$. Continue this process until all rows are filled.\n\nStep 3: Sum all the values in every column, and take those values mod $2^{20}$.\n\nStep 4: Concatenate the base-10 representations of the column sums together, to get a very long base-10 number. For instance, if you had column sums of 10 and 12 for the first and second column, the leftmost four digits of the resulting value would be 1012.\n\nStep 5: Convert the result of step 4 from base $10$ to base $27$. This will yield the one-time pad the Martians used.\n\nStep 6: For each letter $l$ of the intercepted message, shift the letter by the amount given by the corresponding digit of step 5, base $27$. \u201cShifting\u201d means to add the digit at the corresponding position of the pad to the value of the letter in the encrypted message and then to compute its remainder modulo $27$. You may assume that both the encrypted and the decrypted message consist of only uppercase English characters \u2018A\u2019 through \u2018Z\u2019 and spaces, which are assigned values $0 \\ldots 26$ (A = 0, B = 1, ...
