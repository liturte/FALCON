Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} \u2192 a_{n}, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1. \n\nHelp Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Twilight Sparkle needs to sort it.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
