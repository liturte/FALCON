It then calculates the difference between the second and the first number, and the third and the second number. If the difference between the first and the second number is the same as the difference between the second and the third number, this means that the missing number is less than the second number, otherwise it is greater than the third number. The code then returns the appropriate missing number.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"4 6 8\", the code will return \"10\".\n\nNote: The code assumes that the input will always be three numbers, and that the numbers will always be between -100 and 100. It does not handle invalid input.\n\nThis code is written in Python.\n\nThis code works by first sorting the given numbers.

The difference between consecutive numbers in an arithmetic progression is constant. So, the difference between the smallest and the largest number in the given numbers should be the same as the difference between the second smallest and the second largest number. We can use this property to find the missing number.\n\nWe first sort the given numbers. The smallest number will be at index 0, the second smallest at index 1, and the largest at index 2. The difference between the smallest and the largest number in the sorted list is `sorted([a, b, c])[2] - sorted([a, b, c])[0]`. The difference between the second smallest and the second largest number in the sorted list is `sorted([a, b, c])[1] - sorted([a, b, c])[2]`. We can find the missing number by adding the difference between the smallest and the largest number to the second smallest number.\n\nThis solution works because the", "def find_missing(nums):\n    nums = sorted(nums)\n    if nums[2] - nums[1] > nums[1] - nums[0]:\n        return nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[2]\n    else:\n        return nums[2] + nums[2] - nums[1]\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(find_missing(nums))\n\n\nThis Python program works by first sorting the input numbers. It then checks if the difference between the second and third number is greater than the difference between the first and second number. If so, the missing number is the average of the first and second numbers. Otherwise, the missing number is the average of the second and third numbers.\n\nThe `find_missing` function calculates the missing number and the `map` function is used to convert the input string into integers. The result is printed out.\n\nThis program works by using the fact that in an arithmetic progression, the difference between any two consecutive numbers is constant.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the input numbers are distinct. If the input numbers are not distinct, the program may return an incorrect result.\n\nAlso, this program does not handle any input", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint((a+b+c)-max(a,b,c))\n\n\nIn the above python code, we first take the input of three numbers a, b and c. Then we calculate the sum of these three numbers and subtract the maximum of these three numbers from the sum. The difference will be the missing number in the arithmetic progression.\n\nThis works because the sum of the first three numbers in the arithmetic progression is equal to the sum of all four numbers minus the maximum of the three numbers. The difference between the maximum and minimum number in the progression will be the same as the difference between the third and fourth numbers in the progression.\n\nThe maximum of the three numbers is subtracted from the sum to ensure that the missing number is not greater than any of the existing numbers. If we simply subtracted the minimum of the three numbers from the sum, the missing number could be less than the smallest existing number, which is not possible in an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor example, if the numbers are 2, 4, 6, the sum of these numbers is 12 and the maximum number is 6. So the missing number will be 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nIf the numbers are 2, 4, 8, the sum of"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nMirko has chosen four integers which form an arithmetic progression.
