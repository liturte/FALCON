For this purpose, he mixes frosting sugar with lemon juice and food coloring, in order to produce three kinds of frosting: yellow, pink, and white. These colors are identified by the numbers $0$ for yellow, $1$\u00a0for pink, and $2$ for white.\n\nTo obtain a nice pattern, he partitions the cake surface into vertical stripes of width $A_1, A_2, \\dots , A_ n$ centimeters, and horizontal stripes of height $B_1, B_2, \\dots , B_ n$ centimeters, for some positive integer\u00a0$n$. These stripes split the cake surface into $n\\times n$ rectangles. The intersection of vertical stripe\u00a0$i$ and horizontal stripe\u00a0$j$ has color number $(i+j) \\bmod 3$ for all $1 \\leq i,j \\leq n$. To prepare the frosting, Iskander wants to know the total surface in square centimeters to be colored for each of the three colors, and asks for your help.Input\n\nThe input consists of the following integers:\n - on the first line: the integer $n$,\n - on the second line: the values of $A_1,\\dots ,A_ n$, $n$ integers separated with single spaces,\n - on the third line: the values of $B_1,\\dots ,B_ n$, $n$ integers separated with single spaces.Limits\n\nThe input satisfies $3\\leq n \\leq 100000$ and $1 \\leq A_1,\\ldots ,A_ n,B_1,\\ldots ,B_ n \\leq 10000$.Output\n\nThe output should consist of three integers separated with single spaces, representing the total area for each color $0$, $1$, and $2$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nSample Output:\n3 3 3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
