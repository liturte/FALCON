The fence consists of n planks of the same width which go one after another from left to right. The height of the i-th plank is h_{i} meters, distinct planks can have distinct heights. [Image] Fence for n = 7 and h = [1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 7, 1] \n\nPolycarpus has bought a posh piano and is thinking about how to get it into the house. In order to carry out his plan, he needs to take exactly k consecutive planks from the fence. Higher planks are harder to tear off the fence, so Polycarpus wants to find such k consecutive planks that the sum of their heights is minimal possible.\n\nWrite the program that finds the indexes of k consecutive planks with minimal total height. Pay attention, the fence is not around Polycarpus's home, it is in front of home (in other words, the fence isn't cyclic).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1.5\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of planks in the fence and the width of the hole for the piano. The second line contains the sequence of integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 \u2264 h_{i} \u2264 100), where h_{i} is the height of the i-th plank of the fence.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint such integer j that the sum of the heights of planks j, j + 1, ..., j + k - 1 is the minimum possible. If there are multiple such j's, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3\n1 2 6 1 1 7 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the sample, your task is to find three consecutive planks with the minimum sum of heights. In the given case three planks with indexes 3, 4 and 5 have the required attribute, their total height is 8.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
