In return, Simone often points out that many of the chores her mother assigns her are NP-complete to perform optimally (like cleaning the house, seating her little brothers around the dinner table in a conflict-free way, splitting the brothers\u2019 Halloween loot in a fair manner and so on). \n\nBeing a computer scientist, her mother finds this a fair objection. Looking over her list of potential chores, she picked one she thinks should be easy to solve \u2013 pairing a number of different kinds of socks.\n\nIn the beginning, there are $2n$ socks stacked in a pile. To pair the socks, Simone can repeatedly make one of three moves:\n - Move the sock from the top of the original pile to the top of an auxiliary pile (which is originally empty).\n - Move the sock from the top of the auxiliary pile to the top of the original pile.\n - Pair the top socks from each pile together, if they are of the same type.\n\nSimone only has one auxiliary pile, for a total of two piles. There may be more than two socks of each type. In this case, Simone can pair them up however she wants.\n\nYour task is to help Simone to determine the least number of moves she needs to pair the socks, if it is possible at all.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) as described above. The next line contains $2n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots , a_{2n}$ ($1 \\le a_ i \\le 10^9$ for each $i$), where $a_ i$ denotes the type of sock number $i$. Initially, sock $1$ is at the top of the pile and sock $2n$ is at the bottom.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Simone can pair all the socks, output the least number of moves she needs to do this. If it is impossible to do so, output \u201cimpossible\u201d (without the quotes).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n1 2 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n1\n3 7\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
