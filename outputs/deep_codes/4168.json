If the remainder is negative, it is adjusted to be in the range [", "def base_neg2(N: int) -> str:\n    if N == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while N != 0:\n        quotient, remainder = divmod(N, -2)\n        if remainder < 0:\n            quotient, remainder = quotient + 1, remainder + 2\n        res.append(str(remainder))\n        N = quotient\n    return \"\".join(res[::-1])\n\nprint(base_neg2(int(input().strip())))\n\n\nThis solution works by repeatedly dividing the number by -2 and appending the remainder to the result.

This is because in base -2, if the remainder is negative, we need to carry a 1 to the next higher place value, which is", "def baseNeg2(N):\n    if N == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    res = []\n    while N != 0:\n        quotient, remainder = divmod(N, -2)\n        if remainder < 0:\n            quotient, remainder = quotient + 1, remainder + 2\n        res.append(str(remainder))\n        N = quotient\n    return \"\".join(res[::-1])\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(baseNeg2(N))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the division method. The algorithm calculates the remainder when N is divided by -2, and appends it to the result. The quotient is then used for the next iteration. If the remainder is negative, it is adjusted to be in the range [0, -2). The algorithm continues until N becomes 0. The result is revers", "def baseNeg2(N):\n    if N == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    res = []\n    while N != 0:\n        quotient, remainder = divmod(N, -2)\n        if remainder < 0:\n            quotient, remainder = quotient + 1, remainder + 2\n        res.append(str(remainder))\n        N = quotient\n    return \"\".join(res[::-1])\n\n\nThe function `baseNeg2` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the base -2 representation of `N` as a string. It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `N` by -2 and append the remainder to the result list. If the remainder is negative, it adds 1 to the quotient and 2 to the remainder to ensure that the division is always correct. Finally, it returns the result as a string by reversing the order of the", "def baseNeg2(N: int) -> str:\n    if N == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    res = []\n    while N != 0:\n        quotient, remainder = divmod(N, -2)\n        if remainder < 0:\n            quotient, remainder = quotient + 1, remainder + 2\n        res.append(str(remainder))\n        N = quotient\n    return \"\".join(res[::-1])\n\n\nThis function uses a while loop to continuously divide the number by -2 and append the remainder to the result list. If the remainder is negative, it adds 1 to the quotient and 2 to the remainder to ensure the operation remains valid. The result is then reversed and joined to form the final string.\n\nThe divmod function is used to get the quotient and remainder when N is divided by -2.
