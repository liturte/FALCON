Now he wants to tell us about it and also has more awesome scientific news to share with us.\n\n\u201cA palindrome is a word that is the same no matter whether you read it backward or forward\u201d, Per recently said in an interview. He continued: \u201cFor example, add is not a palindrome, because reading it backwards gives dda and it\u2019s actually not the same thing, you see. However, if we reorder the letters of the word, we can actually get a palindrome. Hence, we say that add is a Peragram, because it is an anagram of a palindrome\u201d.\n\nPer gives us a more formal definition of Peragrams: \u201cLike I said, if a word is an anagram of at least one palindrome, we call it a Peragram. And recall that an anagram of a word $w$ contains exactly the same letters as $w$, possibly in a different order.\u201d\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven a string, find the minimum number of letters you have to remove from it, so that the string becomes a Peragram.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a string on a single line. The string will contain at least $1$ and at most $1000$ characters. The string will only contain lowercase letters a-z.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should consist of a single integer on a single line, the minimum number of characters that have to be removed from the string to make it a Peragram.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nabc\nSample Output:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
