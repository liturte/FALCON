It then takes in a string representing the desired order of the numbers. Based on the string, it prints out the numbers in the desired order.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be in the correct format (i.e., three integers separated by spaces followed by a string of three uppercase letters). If this is not the case, the code will need to be modified to handle these edge cases.\n\nThe code also assumes that the input will always be valid (i.e., the numbers will always be less than or equal to 10", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\norder = input()\nif order == 'ABC':\n    print(A, B, C)\nelif order == 'ACB':\n    print(A, C, B)\nelif order == 'BAC':\n    print(B, A, C)\nelif order == 'BCA':\n    print(B, C, A)\nelif order == 'CAB':\n    print(C, A, B)\nelif order == 'CBA':\n    print(C, B, A)\n\n\nThis solution reads the input as three integers and the desired order. It then prints the numbers in the desired order.\n\nThe if-elif statements check the desired order and print the numbers in the correct order. The map function is used to read the input as three integers. The input() function reads a line of input from the user and the split() method splits the input into words. The map function applies the int() function to each word, converting them to integers. The print function then prints the numbers in the desired order.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\norder = input()\nif order == \"ABC\":\n    print(A, B, C)\nelif order == \"ACB\":\n    print(A, C, B)\nelif order == \"BAC\":\n    print(B, A, C)\nelif order == \"BCA\":\n    print(B, C, A)\nelif order == \"CAB\":\n    print(C, A, B)\nelif order == \"CBA\":\n    print(C, B, A)\n\n\nThis program reads three integers and a string from the input, then prints them in the order specified by the string. The program uses a series of if-elif statements to check the string and print the numbers in the correct order.\n\nThe map function is used to read the three integers from the input, and the split function is used to separate the string into a list of characters. The integers and characters are then stored in the variables A, B, C and order respectively.\n\nThe program then checks the value of the order variable and prints the numbers in the correct order. If the order is \"AB", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\norder = input()\n\nif order == \"ABC\":\n    print(A, B, C)\nelif order == \"ACB\":\n    print(A, C, B)\nelif order == \"BAC\":\n    print(B, A, C)\nelif order == \"BCA\":\n    print(B, C, A)\nelif order == \"CAB\":\n    print(C, A, B)\nelif order == \"CBA\":\n    print(C, B, A)\n\nThis code first reads the three numbers A, B, and C and the order string from the input. Then it checks the order string and prints the numbers in the desired order.\n\nThe order string is a string of three characters \"ABC\", \"ACB\", \"BAC\", \"BCA\", \"CAB\", or \"CBA\". Each character in the string corresponds to the position of one number in the output. For example, if the order string is \"ABC\", then the numbers A, B, and C are printed in their original order. If the order string is \"ACB\",", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\norder = input()\nif order == 'ABC':\n    print(A, B, C)\nelif order == 'ACB':\n    print(A, C, B)\nelif order == 'BAC':\n    print(B, A, C)\nelif order == 'BCA':\n    print(B, C, A)\nelif order == 'CAB':\n    print(C, A, B)\nelif order == 'CBA':\n    print(C, B, A)\n\n\nThis program reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Then it reads the desired order of these numbers from the input. Depending on the order, it prints the numbers in the desired order.\n\nThe if-elif-else structure checks the desired order and prints the numbers accordingly.\n\nThe map function is used to convert the input strings into integers.
