In order to ensure the secret and secure of this scouting campaign, the agency gives a secret ID to each member.\n\nEach ID is a binary string of length $n$. To prevent enemies from infiltrating the agency, they choose a pattern $P$, which is a string of 1 and *, and decides that an ID is valid iff it satisfies this pattern $P$.\n\nA binary string $S = s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_ n$ satisfies a pattern $P = p_1 p_2 \\ldots p_ m$ iff any of these conditions holds:\n - $m = n$, and for each valid index $i$, either $s_ i = 1$ or $p_ i = *$.\n - $m < n$, and at least one substring of $S$ satisfies the pattern $P$.\n\nFor example:\n - Both strings 101 and 111 satisfy the pattern 1*1.\n - These strings 0101110, 1110000 and 1010111 satisfy the pattern 1*1, since 101 and 111 are their substrings.\n - The string 0100010 does not satisfy the pattern 1*1.\n\nThe agency wants to know how many spies they can employ, if each member has a unique ID.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line contains one integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 50)$ \u2014 the length of a valid ID.\n - The second line contains a string of at most $30$ characters 1 and *, where at least half of them are 1s \u2014 the pattern $P$ which all valid IDs must satisfy.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of members in the agency, if each is assigned a unique valid ID.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10\n1\nSample Output:\n1023\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
