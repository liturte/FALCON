It does this by replacing '100' with '00' and '10000' with '0000' up to the maximum possible number of times. After this, it converts the remaining string to an integer in base 2 and checks if it is divisible by 64.

Then it checks if the length of the remaining string is divisible by 32. If not, it returns 'no'. If the length is divisible by 32, it checks if the remaining string is divisible by 8. If it is, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'.\n\nThis code works because a binary number divisible by", "def is_divisible_by_64(s):\n    while len(s) > 1 and s[0] == '0':\n        s = s[1:]\n    if len(s) % 2 == 1:\n        return False\n    while len(s) > 0:\n        if s[-1] == '1':\n            return False\n        s = s[:-1]\n    return True\n\ns = input()\nprint('yes' if is_divisible_by_64(s) else 'no')\n\n\nThis solution works by first removing leading zeros. Then, it checks that the number of ones is even. If it's not, it's impossible for the number to be divisible by 64. Finally, it checks that all remaining digits are zeros. If they are, the number is divisible by 64. If not, it's not divisible by 64.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass through", "def is_divisible_by_64(s):\n    while len(s) > 1 and s[0] == '0':\n        s = s[1:]\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return \"no\"\n    return \"yes\" if int(s, 2) % 64 == 0 else \"no\"\n\nprint(is_divisible_by_64(input()))\n\n\nThis Python program works by first removing all leading zeros from the input string. This is because a number is divisible by 64 if and only if its binary representation is divisible by 64, and the binary representation of a number cannot start with zeros. \n\nThen, it checks if the remaining string is empty. If it is, the function returns \"no\", since an empty string cannot be converted to an integer. \n\nFinally, it checks if the integer representation of the remaining string is divisible by 64.

The leading zeros are removed from the string `s` using the `lstrip` method.\n2. If the length of the resulting string is less than 3, it means that the string cannot be transformed into a number divisible by 64, so 'no' is returned.\n3.
