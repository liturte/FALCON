Restaurant i is in city S_i, and your assessment score of that restaurant on a 100-point scale is P_i.\nNo two restaurants have the same score.\nYou want to introduce the restaurants in the following order:\n - The restaurants are arranged in lexicographical order of the names of their cities.\n - If there are multiple restaurants in the same city, they are arranged in descending order of score.\nPrint the identification numbers of the restaurants in the order they are introduced in the book.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n - S is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.\n - 0 \u2264 P_i \u2264 100\n - P_i is an integer.\n - P_i \u2260 P_j (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nS_1 P_1\n:\nS_N P_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint N lines. The i-th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) should contain the identification number of the restaurant that is introduced i-th in the book.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\nkhabarovsk 20\nmoscow 10\nkazan 50\nkazan 35\nmoscow 60\nkhabarovsk 40\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n4\n6\n1\n5\n2\n\nThe lexicographical order of the names of the three cities is kazan < khabarovsk < moscow. For each of these cities, the restaurants in it are introduced in descending order of score. Thus, the restaurants are introduced in the order 3,4,6,1,5,2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
