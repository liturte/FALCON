Every employee was granted a car, and an employee can choose one of four different car makes.\n\nThe parking lot before the office consists of one line of (2n - 2) parking spaces. Unfortunately the total number of cars is greater than the parking lot capacity. Furthermore even amount of cars of each make is greater than the amount of parking spaces! That's why there are no free spaces on the parking lot ever.\n\nLooking on the straight line of cars the company CEO thought that parking lot would be more beautiful if it contained exactly n successive cars of the same make. Help the CEO determine the number of ways to fill the parking lot this way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 30) \u2014 the amount of successive cars of the same make.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the number of ways to fill the parking lot by cars of four makes using the described way.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n24\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's denote car makes in the following way: A \u2014 Aston Martin, B \u2014   Bentley, M \u2014 Mercedes-Maybach, Z \u2014 Zaporozhets. For n = 3 there are the following appropriate ways to fill the parking lot: AAAB AAAM AAAZ ABBB AMMM AZZZ BBBA BBBM BBBZ BAAA BMMM BZZZ MMMA MMMB MMMZ MAAA MBBB MZZZ ZZZA ZZZB ZZZM ZAAA ZBBB ZMMM\n\nOriginally it was planned to grant sport cars of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Bugatti makes but this idea was renounced because it is impossible to drive these cars having small road clearance on the worn-down roads of IT City.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
