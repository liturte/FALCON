For example they own a die that has $10$ sides with numbers $47, 48, \\ldots , 56$ on it.\n\nThere has been a big storm in Stockholm, so Gunnar and Emma have been stuck at home without electricity for a couple of hours. They have finished playing all the games they have, so they came up with a new one. Each player has 2 dice which he or she rolls. The player with a bigger sum wins. If both sums are the same, the game ends in a tie.\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven the description of Gunnar\u2019s and Emma\u2019s dice, which player has higher chances of winning?\n\nAll of their dice have the following property: each die contains numbers $a, a+1, \\dots , b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lowest and highest numbers respectively on the die. Each number appears exactly on one side, so the die has $b-a+1$ sides.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains four integers $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$ that describe Gunnar\u2019s dice. Die number $i$ contains numbers $a_ i, a_ i + 1, \\dots , b_ i$ on its sides. You may assume that $1\\le a_ i \\le b_ i \\le 100$. You can further assume that each die has at least four sides, so $a_ i + 3\\le b_ i$.\n\nThe second line contains the description of Emma\u2019s dice in the same format.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the name of the player that has higher probability of winning. Output \u201cTie\u201d if both players have same probability of winning.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 4 1 4\n1 6 1 6\nSample Output 1:\nEmma\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 8 1 8\n1 10 2 5\nSample Output 2:\nTie\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
