However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows in one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is currently at (x, y).  If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to (x + 1, y).  If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to (x, y - 1).  If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to (x - 1, y).  If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to (x, y + 1). \n\nAlternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at (x, y). Given the wind direction for t seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to (e_{x}, e_{y})?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains five integers t, s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^5,  - 10^9 \u2264 s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} \u2264 10^9). The starting location and the ending location will be different.\n\nThe second line contains t characters, the i-th character is the wind blowing direction at the i-th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: \"E\" (east), \"S\" (south), \"W\" (west) and \"N\" (north).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf they can reach (e_{x}, e_{y}) within t seconds, print the earliest time they can achieve it. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 0 0 1 1\nSESNW\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n10 5 3 3 6\nNENSWESNEE\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, they can stay at seconds 1, 3, and move at seconds 2, 4.\n\nIn the second sample, they cannot sail to the destination.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
