He has invented his own cipher called repeating.\n\nRepeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string $s=s_{1}s_{2} \\dots s_{m}$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10$), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:\n\n  he writes down $s_1$ ones,  he writes down $s_2$ twice,  he writes down $s_3$ three times,  ...  he writes down $s_m$ $m$ times. \n\nFor example, if $s$=\"bab\" the process is: \"b\" $\\to$ \"baa\" $\\to$ \"baabbb\". So the encrypted $s$=\"bab\" is \"baabbb\".\n\nGiven string $t$ \u2014 the result of encryption of some string $s$. Your task is to decrypt it, i. e. find the string $s$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 55$) \u2014 the length of the encrypted string. The second line of the input contains $t$ \u2014 the result of encryption of some string $s$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters. The length of $t$ is exactly $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer to the test exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint such string $s$ that after encryption it equals $t$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\nbaabbb\n\nOutput\nbab\nInput\n10\nooopppssss\n\nOutput\noops\nInput\n1\nz\n\nOutput\nz\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
