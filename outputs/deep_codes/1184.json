The split(', ') function splits the string into a list of letters. The set() function converts the list into a set, which automatically removes duplicate letters. Finally, len() returns the number of elements in the set.\n\n\nNOTE: The input and output format is based on the problem statement. The solution assumes that the input is always in the correct format as described in the problem statement.\n\nThis solution is written in Python 3.\n\n\nThis code will not work for inputs like \"{b, a, b, a}\", \"{b a b a}\", \"{b,,a,b,a}\", \"{b, ,a,b,a}\", \"{b, a,,b,a}\", \"{b, a,b ,a}\", \"", "print(len(set(input()[2:-2].split(', '))))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution works by first removing the curly brackets from the input using Python's slicing operation. Then it splits the string into a list of letters using the `split()` method. Finally, it converts this list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and then it counts the number of elements in this set using the `len()` function.\n\nThe `set()` function is used to remove duplicates, and `len()` is used to count the number of elements in the set. The `split()` function is used to split the string into a list of letters, and the `[2:-2]` is used to remove the curly brackets from the string. The `split()` function is called with `', '` as the separator, which means it splits the string at each comma followed by a space.\n\nPlease note that the input string should not have spaces before or after", "print(len(set(input()[2:-2].split(', '))))\n\n\nThis Python program reads the input string, removes the curved brackets and splits the remaining string into a list of letters.

The `split(', ')` function is used to split the string into a list of letters.

If you want to handle potential errors, you would need to add error checking code.", "print(len(set(input()[2:-2].split(','))))\n\n\nThis Python code reads the input string, removes the curly brackets and splits the string into a list of letters. It then converts this list to a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and prints the length of the set.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"{a, b, c}\", the code first removes the curly brackets and the spaces, resulting in \"a,b,c\". It then splits this string into a list ['a', 'b', 'c'], converts this list to a set {a, b, c}, and prints the length of the set, which is 3.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is always a valid set of letters, as described in the problem statement. If this is not the case, you should add error checking code to handle invalid inputs.\n\nAlso, this solution is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert", "print(len(set(input()[2:-2].split(','))))\n\n\nThis Python program reads the input, removes the brackets and splits the remaining string into a list of letters.

Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated by a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the line and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line. \n\nUnfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and write it again. He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his set.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the line doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening curved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. Between them, small English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of distinct letters in Anton's set.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n{a, b, c}\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n{b, a, b, a}\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n{}\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
