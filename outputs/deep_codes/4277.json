The minimum of these two values is printed as the minimum total travel expense.\n\nIn the given sample input 4 2 9, the train will cost us 4*2=8 yen, and the taxi will cost us 9 yen. So, the minimum total travel expense is 8 yen.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(N*A, B))\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `min` function to find the smaller of the two possible costs: the cost of the train (N*A) and the cost of the taxi (B). The inputs are read from the standard input using Python's built-in `input` function and `split` function to split the input into separate values.\n\nThis solution is simple and efficient, as it only involves a few lines of code.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(N*A, B))\n\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input values from strings to integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input line into separate strings. The `min` function is used to find the smaller of the two costs.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), since it always executes the same number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), since it always uses the same amount of memory regardless of the input size.\n\nPlease note that the input and output format may vary depending on the exact problem statement and the programming language used.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(N*A, B))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads the input values for N, A, and B. It then calculates the minimum of the train cost (N*A) and the taxi cost (B). The minimum value is the minimum total travel expense.\n\nThe `min()` function is used to find the smallest of the input values. The `map()` function is used to convert the input string to integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings based on spaces, and the `int()` function converts each substring to an integer.\n\nThe `print()` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the train is cheaper than the taxi for the same distance. If the taxi is cheaper, the minimum total travel expense will be the taxi cost. If the train and taxi costs are equal, the minimum total travel expense will be the train cost.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(N*A, B))\n\n\nThis Python program reads the input, calculates the cost of the train and the taxi separately, and then prints the minimum of these two costs.\n\nIt uses the `map` function to read three integers from the input. The `split` function is used to split the input string by spaces, and `int` is used to convert these strings to integers.\n\nThe `min` function is used to find the minimum of two numbers.
