The corners of rectangles have integer coordinates and their edges are parallel to the Ox and Oy axes. The rectangles may touch each other, but they do not overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle). \n\nYour task is to determine if the rectangles form a square. In other words, determine if the set of points inside or on the border of at least one rectangle is precisely equal to the set of points inside or on the border of some square.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5). Next n lines contain four integers each, describing a single rectangle: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (0 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 \u2264 31400, 0 \u2264 y_1 < y_2 \u2264 31400) \u2014 x_1 and x_2 are x-coordinates of the left and right edges of the rectangle, and y_1 and y_2 are y-coordinates of the bottom and top edges of the rectangle. \n\nNo two rectangles overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print \"YES\", if the given rectangles form a square, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n0 0 2 3\n0 3 3 5\n2 0 5 2\n3 2 5 5\n2 2 3 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n4\n0 0 2 3\n0 3 3 5\n2 0 5 2\n3 2 5 5\n\nOutput\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
