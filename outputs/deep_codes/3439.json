Even though his previous plan of a giant dome over Stockholm to protect from too much sunlight (as well as rain and snow) has not yet been realized, he is now focusing on preempting the possible effects climate change might have on the Baltic Sea, by the elegant solution of simply removing the Baltic from the equation. \n\nFirst, Gunnar wants to build a floodbank connecting Denmark and Norway to separate the Baltic from the Atlantic Ocean. The floodbank will also help protect Nordic countries from rising sea levels in the ocean. Next, Gunnar installs a device that can drain the Baltic from the seafloor. The device will drain as much water as needed to the Earth\u2019s core where it will disappear forever (because that is how physics works, at least as far as Gunnar is concerned). However, depending on the placement of the device, the entire Baltic might not be completely drained \u2013 some pockets of water may remain.\n\nTo simplify the problem, Gunnar is approximating the map of the Baltic using a $2$-dimensional grid with $1$ meter squares.
