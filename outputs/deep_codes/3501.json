The trip included a camel ride, and after returning from the ride, their guide invited them to a big camel race in the evening. The camels they rode will also participate and it is customary to bet on the results of the race. \n\nOne of the most interesting bets involves guessing the complete order in which the camels will finish the race. This bet offers the biggest return on your money, since it is also the one that is the hardest to get right.\n\nJaap, Jan, and Thijs have already placed their bets, but the race will not start until an hour from now, so they are getting bored. They started wondering how many pairs of camels they have put in the same order. If camel\u00a0$c$ is before camel\u00a0$d$ on Jaap\u2019s, Jan\u2019s and Thijs\u2019 bet, it means that all three of them put $c$ and $d$ in the same order. Can you help them to calculate the number of pairs of camels for which this happened?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with an integer $n$ ($2\\leq n \\leq 200000$), the number of camels;\n - one line with $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots , a_ n$ ($1 \\le a_ i \\le n$ for all $i$), Jaap\u2019s bet. Here $a_1$ is the camel in the first position of Jaap\u2019s bet, $a_2$ is the camel in the second position, and so on;\n - one line with Jan\u2019s bet, in the same format as Jaap\u2019s bet;\n - one line with Thijs\u2019 bet, in the same format as Jaap\u2019s bet.\n\nThe camels are numbered $1, \\dots , n$. Each camel appears exactly once in each bet.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of pairs of camels that appear in the same order in all $3$\u00a0bets.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n3 2 1\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\nSample Output:\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
