He wants to win in upcoming elections and rule over the Bearland.\n\nThere are n candidates, including Limak. We know how many citizens are going to vote for each candidate. Now i-th candidate would get a_{i} votes. Limak is candidate number 1. To win in elections, he must get strictly more votes than any other candidate.\n\nVictory is more important than everything else so Limak decided to cheat. He will steal votes from his opponents by bribing some citizens. To bribe a citizen, Limak must give him or her one candy - citizens are bears and bears like candies. Limak doesn't have many candies and wonders - how many citizens does he have to bribe?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) - number of candidates.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000) - number of votes for each candidate. Limak is candidate number 1.\n\nNote that after bribing number of votes for some candidate might be zero or might be greater than 1000.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of citizens Limak must bribe to have strictly more votes than any other candidate.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n5 1 11 2 8\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\n1 8 8 8\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n2\n7 6\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Limak has 5 votes. One of the ways to achieve victory is to bribe 4 citizens who want to vote for the third candidate. Then numbers of votes would be 9, 1, 7, 2, 8 (Limak would have 9 votes). Alternatively, Limak could steal only 3 votes from the third candidate and 1 vote from the second candidate to get situation 9, 0, 8, 2, 8.\n\nIn the second sample Limak will steal 2 votes from each candidate. Situation will be 7, 6, 6, 6.\n\nIn the third sample Limak is a winner without bribing any citizen.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
