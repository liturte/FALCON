We just need to sort the given list of strings lexicographically and then join them together to form the smallest lexicographically string. The built-in Python function `sort()` is used for lexicographical sorting and `join()` is used to concatenate the strings.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the strings are all different.

The `join()` method is then used to concatenate all the strings in the sorted list.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the strings are all distinct. If there could be duplicate strings, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the input strings are all ASCII characters.

It uses the built-in sort function of Python with a custom key function. The key function is a lambda function that returns a string doubled. This is because when the strings are sorted, the strings that would come first if the strings were sorted lexicographically twice are the ones that when concatenated, would result in the smallest lexicographical string. The sorted strings are then joined together to form the final result.\n\nFor example, if we have the strings ['b', 'a', 'c'], the sorted strings would be ['a', 'b', 'c'], and when they are joined together, they form the string 'abc', which is", "def solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    strings = [input() for _ in range(n)]\n    strings.sort(key=lambda s: (s, len(s)))\n    print(''.join(strings))\n\nsolve()\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is based on sorting the strings based on two criteria: the string itself and its length. This ensures that shorter strings come before longer ones, and if two strings have the same length, the one that comes first in lexicographical order comes first in the sorted list. By joining all the sorted strings together, we get the lexicographically smallest concatenation.\n\nThe `key` argument in the `sort` function is a function that takes a string and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string itself, and the second element is the length of the string. The `sort` function sorts the strings first by the first element of the tuple (i.e", "def to_str(List):\n    return ''.join([str(elem) for elem in List])\n\ndef custom_compare(a, b):\n    return (a+b) < (b+a)\n\ndef Lexiographically_smallest_concatenation(string_list):\n    string_list.sort(cmp=custom_compare)\n    return to_str(string_list)\n\nn = int(raw_input().strip())\nstring_list = []\nfor i in xrange(n):\n    string_list.append(raw_input().strip())\n\nprint Lexiographically_smallest_concatenation(string_ci_list)\n\n\nThis Python code takes the number of strings as input, and then for each string, it takes a string as input. The function custom_compare is used to sort the strings in a way that the lexicographically smallest concatenation is obtained."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou're given a list of n strings a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.
