The restaurant hall has a coat rack with n hooks. Each restaurant visitor can use a hook to hang his clothes on it. Using the i-th hook costs a_{i} rubles. Only one person can hang clothes on one hook.\n\nTonight Sereja expects m guests in the restaurant. Naturally, each guest wants to hang his clothes on an available hook with minimum price (if there are multiple such hooks, he chooses any of them). However if the moment a guest arrives the rack has no available hooks, Sereja must pay a d ruble fine to the guest. \n\nHelp Sereja find out the profit in rubles (possibly negative) that he will get tonight. You can assume that before the guests arrive, all hooks on the rack are available, all guests come at different time, nobody besides the m guests is visiting Sereja's restaurant tonight.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and d (1 \u2264 n, d \u2264 100). The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100). The third line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1\n2 1\n2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n2 1\n2 1\n10\n\nOutput\n-5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test both hooks will be used, so Sereja gets 1 + 2 = 3 rubles.\n\nIn the second test both hooks will be used but Sereja pays a fine 8 times, so the answer is 3 - 8 =  - 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
