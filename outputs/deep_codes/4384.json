Otherwise, it prints 'ABD'.\n\nThis is because the labels for the first 999 rounds are ABC001, ABC002, ..., ABC999, while the labels for the remaining rounds (after 999) are ABD001, ABD002, ..., ABD999.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(input())\n    if N <= 999:\n        print(\"ABC\")\n    else:\n        print(\"ABD\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef main():", "N = int(input())\nprint('ABC' if N <= 999 else 'ABD')\n\nThis code firstly reads an integer N from the input. If N is less than or equal to 999, it prints 'ABC', otherwise it prints 'ABD'.\n\nNote that Python's ternary operator (`expr1 if condition else expr2`) can be used to simplify the code. It evaluates to `expr1` if `condition` is true, and to `expr2` if `condition` is false.\n\nAlso, remember that Python's input function reads a line from the standard input (usually the keyboard), converts it to a string, and returns it. So, we need to convert the input to an integer using the int function.\n\nFinally, Python's print function simply prints its arguments, separated by spaces and followed by a newline. So, when we", "print('ABC' if int(input()) <= 999 else 'ABD')\n\n\nThis Python code reads an integer from the standard input, checks if it's less than or equal to 999, and prints \"ABC\" if it is, or \"ABD\" if it isn't.\n\nExplanation:\nThe contest labels are determined by the number of rounds. The first 999 rounds are labeled as ABC001, ABC002, ..., ABC999. After this, the labels change to ABD001, ABD002, ..., ABD999. Therefore, if the round number is 999 or less, the contest is labeled as ABC.

If it is, it prints 'ABC'. Otherwise, it prints 'ABD'.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the labels for the first 1000 rounds are ABC001, ABC002, ..., ABC999, if N is less than 1000, it belongs to the first 1000 rounds.\nIf N is 1000 or more, it means the rounds after ABC999, which are labeled as ABD001, ABD002, ..., ABD999.
