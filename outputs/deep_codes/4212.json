(If there is no such i, the score is 0.)\nFind the maximum possible score of A.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \u2264 N \u2264 10\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 10\n - 1 \\leq Q \\leq 50\n - 1 \\leq a_i < b_i \\leq N ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )\n - 0 \\leq c_i \\leq M - 1 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )\n - (a_i, b_i, c_i) \\neq (a_j, b_j, c_j) (where i \\neq j)\n - 1 \\leq d_i \\leq 10^5 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M Q\na_1 b_1 c_1 d_1\n:\na_Q b_Q c_Q d_Q\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum possible score of A.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 4 3\n1 3 3 100\n1 2 2 10\n2 3 2 10\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n110\n\nWhen A = \\{1, 3, 4\\}, its score is 110. Under these conditions, no sequence has a score greater than 110, so the answer is 110.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
