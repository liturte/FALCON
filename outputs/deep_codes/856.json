To pass time, he asks Lord Omkar to use his time bending power: Infinity Clock! However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:\n\nYou are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers. You are also given an integer $k$. Lord Omkar wants you to do $k$ operations with this array.\n\nDefine one operation as the following:   Set $d$ to be the maximum value of your array.  For every $i$ from $1$ to $n$, replace $a_{i}$ with $d-a_{i}$. \n\nThe goal is to predict the contents in the array after $k$ operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{18}$) \u2013 the length of your array and the number of operations to perform.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$ $(-10^9 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^9)$ \u2013 the initial contents of your array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each case, print the final version of array $a$ after $k$ operations described above.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n2 1\n-199 192\n5 19\n5 -1 4 2 0\n1 2\n69\n\nOutput\n391 0\n0 6 1 3 5\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case the array changes as follows:\n\nInitially, the array is $[-199, 192]$. $d = 192$.\n\nAfter the operation, the array becomes $[d-(-199), d-192] = [391, 0]$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
