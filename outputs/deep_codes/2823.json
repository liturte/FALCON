In order for the apples to grow faster, to get more of them, to make them bigger and make them look nicer and more symmetrical, the apple\u2019s DNA requires an insertion of a certain swine gene.\n\nThe apple\u2019s DNA is represented by a series of characters from the set $\\{ A, C, G, T\\} $. The required swine gene is also comprised of charaters from this set. The apple\u2019s DNA should be injected with some characters into some places, so that the resulting sequence contains a swine gene somewhere (in successive locations). To make things a bit more complicated, inserting each of the characters $A, C, G, T$ has its own cost.\n\nHelp this multinational company in achieving their goal with the lowest possible total cost. As a reward, you get a ton of their apples.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a sequence of $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10000$) characters which represent the apple\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe second line of input contains a sequence of $M$ ($1 \\le M \\le 5000$) characters which represent the swine gene that we want to insert into the apple\u2019s DNA.\n\nBoth the sequences are comprised only of characters from the set $\\{ A, C, G, T\\} $.\n\nThe third line of input contains four integers from the interval $[0, 1000]$: the cost of inserting one character $A, C, G, T$, in that order.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the minimal total cost.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nGTA\nCAT\n5 7 1 3\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\nTATA\nCACA\n3 0 3 0\nSample Output 2:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
