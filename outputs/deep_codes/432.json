If mouse starts in room $1$ then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it eventually comes to room $4$.\n\nIn the second example it is enough to set mouse trap in room $2$. If mouse starts in room $2$ then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it runs to room $2$ in second $1$.\n\nHere are the paths of the mouse from different starts from the third example:\n\n  $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $2 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $4 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $6 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow \\dots$;  $7 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow \\dots$; \n\nSo it's enough to set traps in rooms $2$ and $6$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
