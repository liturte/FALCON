If the kangaroo's position is equal to X at any point, it prints the current time. If the kangaroo's position never reaches X, it prints -1.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the kangaroo can only jump to the left or to the right, and that he can only jump to a position that is less than or equal to X. The time complexity of this solution is O(X) because it loops until the kangaroo's position is equal to X. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the time and position.\n\nPlease note that the kangaroo can only jump to a", "import math\n\ndef kangaroo():\n    X = int(input())\n    time = int((math.sqrt(8*X + 1) - 1) / 2)\n    print(time)\n\nkangaroo()\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe kangaroo can reach a position x in time i by jumping i units to the right or left. \n\nWe can model this as a graph where each node is a position and each edge is a time unit. \n\nWe start from the position 0, and the earliest time to reach any position is the distance from the origin. \n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of the first n integers to calculate the earliest time to reach a position x. \n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n integers is n*(n+1)/2. \n\nWe solve this formula for x to find the earliest time.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the kangaroo can jump at most one unit per time", "import math\n\ndef kangaroo_jump():\n    X = int(input())\n    time = 0\n    position = 0\n\n    while position < X:\n        time += 1\n        position += time\n\n    return time if position == X else -1\n\nprint(kangaroo_jump())\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program solves the problem by simulating the kangaroo's journey. The while loop continues until the kangaroo reaches or passes the nest's position. Inside the loop, the time and position are updated at each step. The function returns the time if the kangaroo reaches the nest, or -1 if it cannot reach the nest.\n\nThe time is incremented at each step, representing the passage of time. The position is updated by adding the time to the current position, simulating the kangaroo's jump. The loop continues until the position is greater than or equal to the nest's position. If the position equals the nest", "import math\n\ndef kangaroo():\n    X = int(input())\n    time = (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8*X)) / 2\n    return math.ceil(time)\n\nprint(kangaroo())\n\n\nThis code is a solution to the problem. It calculates the time it takes for the kangaroo to reach the nest using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is derived from the fact that the kangaroo can either stay at his position, or perform a jump of length exactly i to the left or to the right. The sum of the series is the total distance the kangaroo can travel, which is the distance to the nest. The time it takes to travel this distance is the sum of the series, which is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the series is given by (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8*X)) / 2, where sqrt is the square root function. The time is", "import math\nX = int(input())\nprint(math.ceil((math.sqrt(8*X + 1) - 1) / 2))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe kangaroo can reach a position x at time i by jumping either left or right i units. Therefore, to reach a position x in the least time, we should choose i such that x is as large as possible.\n\nThis leads to the equation 2i^2 + 2i = 2x.\nSolving this equation for i gives us the earliest possible time to reach position x. The solution involves taking the square root of both sides, and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n\nIn Python, we can use the math.ceil function to round up to the nearest integer. The math.sqrt function returns the square root of a number. The whole equation is enclosed in parentheses to ensure that the square root operation is performed before the division.\n\nThis solution works because the kangaroo can jump to the right as many times as it"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere is a kangaroo at coordinate 0 on an infinite number line that runs from left to right, at time 0.\nDuring the period between time i-1 and time i, the kangaroo can either stay at his position, or perform a jump of length exactly i to the left or to the right.\nThat is, if his coordinate at time i-1 is x, he can be at coordinate x-i, x or x+i at time i.\nThe kangaroo's nest is at coordinate X, and he wants to travel to coordinate X as fast as possible.\nFind the earliest possible time to reach coordinate X.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - X is an integer.\n - 1\u2264X\u226410^9\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nX\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the earliest possible time for the kangaroo to reach coordinate X.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThe kangaroo can reach his nest at time 3 by jumping to the right three times, which is the earliest possible time.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
