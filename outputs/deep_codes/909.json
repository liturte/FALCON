{"909": {"code": ["a = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nprint(max(a*b*c, a+b*c, (a+b)*c, a*b+c, a+b+c))\n\n\nThis solution works by using Python's built-in `max` function to compare the results of five different arithmetic operations:\n\n- `a*b*c`: the standard multiplication operation.\n- `a+b*c`: inserting '+' between a and b, and '*' between b and c.\n- `(a+b)*c`:", "a = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nprint(max(a+b*c, a*b+c, a*b*c, (a+b)*c))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a simple program that reads three integers from the input, and then prints the maximum value that can be obtained by inserting '+' and '*' signs and possibly brackets in the numbers in the given order. This is done by calculating all possible expressions and then selecting the maximum value.\n\nThe possible expressions are:\n1. a+b*c\n2. a*b", "a = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nprint(max(a*b*c, a+b*c, a*b+c, (a+b)*c, a+b+c))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a python program that takes three integers as input. The program then calculates the possible results of the mathematical expression by considering different ways of inserting signs and brackets between the numbers. The maximum value of these results is then printed as the output.\n\nThe possible results are calculated by considering the four basic operations (+, *) and their combinations. The expression is", "a = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nprint(max(a*b*c, a+b*c, a*b+c, (a+b)*c, a*(b+c), a+b+c))\n\n\nThis Python solution first reads in the three numbers. Then it calculates all possible results of the expression and prints the maximum result. The results are calculated by considering all possible orderings of the operations.\n\nThe expression a*b*c is calculated first, because it will always be the largest number if a, b, and c are all positive. The other expressions are", "a = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\nprint(max(a*b*c, a+b*c, a*b+c, (a+b)*c, a*(b+c), a+b+c))\n\n\nThis solution works by first taking in the three inputs from the user and converting them to integers. It then uses the `max` function to find the maximum value from a set of possible expressions. These expressions are based on the rules of mathematical order of operations, specifically that multiplication has higher precedence than addition. The `max` function returns the largest value from the set of expressions"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nPetya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers a, b, c on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:  1+2*3=7  1*(2+3)=5  1*2*3=6  (1+2)*3=9 \n\nNote that you can insert operation signs only between a and b, and between b and c, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.\n\nIt's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.\n\nYour task is: given a, b and c print the maximum value that you can get.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains three integers a, b and c, each on a single line (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n2\n3\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2\n10\n3\n\nOutput\n60\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
