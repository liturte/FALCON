{"4606": {"code": ["print(f\"ABC{int(input())}\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe program reads an integer from the standard input, appends it to the string \"ABC\", and prints the result. It uses the format string feature of Python to achieve this. The `int(input())` part reads the input and converts it to an integer, which is then appended to the \"ABC\" string.\n\nThis is a simple and efficient solution, as it uses Python's built-in input and print functions, and the format string feature. It also adheres to the constraints of the problem (100 \u2264 N \u2264 999).\n\nIt's important to note that this solution assumes that the input is always a valid integer within the given range. If this is not the case, you may want to add error checking to handle invalid inputs.\n\nThe code does not use any import statements, and does not define any functions or classes, making it as clean and efficient as possible. It is also easy to understand and maintain, as it follows the principle of \"Convention over Configuration\" in software development.", "print(f'ABC{int(input())}')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem requires us to read an integer from the standard input, append it to the string 'ABC', and print the result. The input() function is used to read the integer, and the int() function is used to convert the input string to an integer. The f-string is used to format the string, inserting the integer into the string where the {} is.\n\nThis solution is as simple and efficient as it can be, taking advantage of Python's built-in functions and syntax.\n\n\nprint(f'ABC{int(input())}')\n\n\nThis code reads an integer from standard input, converts it to a string, and then prints 'ABC' followed by the integer. The f-string is a convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {} as placeholders.\n\n\nprint('ABC' + str(int(input())))\n\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous one, but uses the str() function to convert the integer to a string, and the '+' operator to concatenate the strings.\n\n\nn = int(input())\nprint('ABC' + str(n))\n\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous ones", "N = int(input())\nprint(f'ABC{N}')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads an integer N from standard input. It then prints 'ABC', followed by the value of N. The f-string formatting is used to insert the value of N into the string.\n\nThis code is written in Python. It works by reading the input, converting it into an integer, and then formatting a string that includes 'ABC' and the integer value of N. The result is printed to standard output.\n\nThis code is efficient and easy to understand, and it will work for any integer N between 100 and 999, as per the problem constraints.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is a valid integer and that it is within the given range. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be needed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# solution\nN = int(input())\nprint(f'ABC{N}')\n\n\n\n# 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "n = int(input())\nprint(\"ABC\" + str(n))\n\n\nThis Python program takes an integer N as input, concatenates \"ABC\" and the string representation of N, and prints the result.\n\nHere, `input()` is used to read the input, `int()` to convert it to an integer, `str()` to convert the integer to a string, and `print()` to print the result.\n\nThe `+` operator is used to concatenate the \"ABC\" string and the integer string.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be a number between 100 and 999, as specified in the problem statement.\n\"\"\"\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(\"ABC\" + str(n))\n\n\nThis Python program takes an integer N as input, concatenates \"ABC\" and the string representation of N, and prints the result.\n\nHere, `input()` is used to read the input, `int()` to convert it to an integer, `str()` to convert the integer to a string, and `print()` to print the result.\n\nThe `+` operator is used to concatenate the \"ABC\" string and the integer string.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be a number between 100 and 999", "N = int(input())\nprint(\"ABC\"+str(N))\n\n\nThis program reads an integer from the standard input, and then prints the abbreviation for the N-th round of ABC by concatenating the strings \"ABC\", the integer N converted to a string, and the newline character.\n\nIn this case, the input 100 would result in the output \"ABC100\".\n\nThe int() function is used to convert the input string to an integer.
