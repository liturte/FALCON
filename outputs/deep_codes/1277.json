The i-th edge connects Vertex A_i and B_i bidirectionally.\nTakahashi is standing at Vertex u, and Aoki is standing at Vertex v.\nNow, they will play a game of tag as follows:\n - 1. If Takahashi and Aoki are standing at the same vertex, the game ends. Otherwise, Takahashi moves to a vertex of his choice that is adjacent to his current vertex.\n - 2. If Takahashi and Aoki are standing at the same vertex, the game ends. Otherwise, Aoki moves to a vertex of his choice that is adjacent to his current vertex.\n - 3. Go back to step 1.\nTakahashi performs his moves so that the game ends as late as possible, while Aoki performs his moves so that the game ends as early as possible.\nFind the number of moves Aoki will perform before the end of the game if both Takahashi and Aoki know each other's position and strategy.\nIt can be proved that the game is bound to end.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq u,v \\leq N\n - u \\neq v\n - 1 \\leq A_i,B_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is a tree.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN u v\nA_1 B_1\n:\nA_{N-1} B_{N-1}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of moves Aoki will perform before the end of the game.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 4 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nIf both players play optimally, the game will progress as follows:\n - Takahashi moves to Vertex 3.\n - Aoki moves to Vertex 2.\n - Takahashi moves to Vertex 5.\n - Aoki moves to Vertex 3.\n - Takahashi moves to Vertex 3.\nHere, Aoki performs two moves.\nNote that, in each move, it is prohibited to stay at the current vertex.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
