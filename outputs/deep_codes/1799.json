There are three teams with more balloons (32, 40 and 45 balloons), so Limak has the fourth place initially. One optimal strategy is: Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 32 balloons and weight 37, which is just enough to make them fly. Unfortunately, Limak has only 14 balloons now and he would get the fifth place. Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 45 balloons. Now they have 51 balloons and weight 50 so they fly and get disqualified. Limak gives 1 balloon to each of two teams with 16 balloons initially. Limak has 20 - 6 - 6 - 1 - 1 = 6 balloons. There are three other teams left and their numbers of balloons are 40, 14 and 2. Limak gets the third place because there are two teams with more balloons. \n\nIn the second sample, Limak has the second place and he can't improve it.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak has just enough balloons to get rid of teams 2, 3 and 5 (the teams with 81 000 000 000, 5 000 000 000 and 46 000 000 000 balloons respectively). With zero balloons left, he will get the second place (ex-aequo with team 6 and team 7).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
