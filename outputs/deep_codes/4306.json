It does this by finding the maximum of the start-up times of Alice and Bob's buttons, and the minimum of the release times of Alice and Bob's buttons, and then subtracting the maximum from the minimum. If the result is negative, it means that both of them released their buttons at the same or earlier time than the start-up times", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(0, min(B, D) - max(A, C)))\n\n\nThis python code will read four integers A, B, C, and D from the input. It will then calculate the maximum of 0 and the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C. This will give the duration in seconds when both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons.\n\nFor example, if A=0, B=75, C=25, and D=100, the code will print 50, which is the correct answer.\n\nThis code", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(0, min(B, D) - max(A, C)))\n\n\nThis code reads four integers A, B, C, and D from the input, where A and C are the start times and B and D are the end times.
