The field contains $N \\cdot N$ flowers arranged in $N$ rows and $N$ columns. For each flower in the field, we know how many petals it has.\n\nThe grasshopper is initially on the flower in row $R$ and column $C$. Its goal is to visit as many flowers as possible while obeying these rules:\n - It can only jump into an adjacent row or column. If it jumps into the adjacent row, it must jump at least two columns, and if it jumps into the adjacent column, it must jump at least two rows. In other words, it can jump from flower $(r_1 , c_1)$ to flower $(r_2, c_2)$ if:\n - $|r_1 -r_2| = 1$ and $|c_1 -c_2 |> 1$ or\n - $|c_1 -c_2| = 1$ and $|r_1 -r_2 |> 1$\n - The number of petals on the next flower must be strictly larger than the number of petals on the previous flower.\n\nWrite a program that calculates the largest number of flowers the grasshopper can visit.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1500$), the size of the field.\n\nThe second line contains integers $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le N$) and $C$ ($1 \\le C \\le N$), the grasshopper\u2019s initial position.\n\nThe next $N$ lines contain $N$ positive integers separated by spaces, each at most $1000000$, the numbers of petals on the flowers.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer \u2013 the largest number of flowers the grasshopper can visit.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 1\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 5\n3 4 5 6\n4 5 6 7\nSample Output:\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
