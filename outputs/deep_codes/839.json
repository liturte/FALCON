A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait.
