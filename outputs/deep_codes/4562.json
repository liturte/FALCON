The `math.sqrt()` function returns the square root of the number as a floating point number. We then take this result and round it down to the nearest integer using the `int()` function. We then square this integer using the `**2` operator and print the result.\n\nThis solution works because the square root of N is the largest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of N. If we square this integer, we get the largest square number that is less than or equal to N.\n\nFor example, if N = 10, the square root of N is 3.1622776601683795. If we round this down to the nearest integer, we get 3. If we square this, we get 9, which is the largest square number that is less than or equal to 10.\n\n'''\n\n# code:\nimport math\nN = int(input())\nprint(int(math.sqrt(N))**2)\n\n# This code is a simple solution to the problem. It takes an integer input N, calculates the square root of N, rounds it down to the nearest integer, squares this integer, and prints the result.\n# This solution works because the square root of N is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of N", "import math\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(int(math.floor(math.sqrt(N)) ** 2))\n\n\nThis program uses the sqrt function from the math module to calculate the square root of N, then rounds it down to the nearest integer using the floor function. It then squares this integer and prints the result.\n\nThe int function is used to convert the result to an integer before printing, because the sqrt function returns a float. This is necessary because the square root of a number can be a decimal number, and we are looking for the largest integer not exceeding this number.\n\nFor example, if N is 10, the square root of 10 is 3.1622776601683795. Rounding this down to the nearest integer gives 3, which when squared gives 9. Therefore, 9 is the largest square number not exceeding 10.\n\nIn the case of N = 1, the square root of 1 is 1.0, when rounded down to the nearest integer gives 1. When this is squared, 1^2 = 1, which is the smallest square number not exceeding 1.\n\n\n'''\n\nimport math\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(int(math.floor(math.sqrt(N)) ** 2))\n\n\n'''\nExplanation:\nThe math library in Python provides a sqrt function that can be used to calculate the square root of a number. The floor function is used to round down to the nearest", "import math\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(int(math.floor(math.sqrt(N)) ** 2))\n\n\nThis solution uses the math library's sqrt function to get the square root of N, then uses the math library's floor function to round down to the nearest integer. The result is then squared to get the largest square number not exceeding N.\n\nThis solution assumes that N is a positive integer, as the problem statement states that N will be an integer.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of N. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.\n\nPlease note that this solution only works correctly for N that are less than or equal to 10^9 (100 million). If N is larger than 10^9, you would need to use a different algorithm that can handle larger numbers.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that N is a perfect square, as the problem statement states that N will be a square number. If N is not a perfect square, you would need to adjust the solution to handle this case.", "import math\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(math.floor(math.sqrt(N)) ** 2)\n\n\nThis code first imports the `math` module, which provides the `sqrt` function for calculating square roots and the `floor` function for rounding down. It then reads an integer `N` from input, calculates the square root of `N`, rounds it down to the nearest integer using `math.floor`, squares the result, and prints the result.\n\nThis code works because the largest square number not exceeding `N` is the square of the largest integer `n` such that `n*n <= N`. The `math.sqrt` function calculates `n`, the `math.floor` function rounds it down to the nearest integer, and the `** 2` operation squares it.\n\nThis code assumes that `N` is a non-negative number. If `N` can be negative, you would need to use `math.ceil` instead of `math.floor` to round up to the nearest integer.\n\nPlease note that the `math.floor` and `** 2` operations are combined into one line of code for brevity and readability.\n\nThis code also assumes that `N` is a non-negative number. If `N` can be negative, you would need to use `math.ceil` instead of `math.floor` to round up to the nearest integer.\n\nThis code works because the largest square number not exceeding `N` is the square of the largest integer `n` such that `n*n <=", "import math\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(int(math.floor(math.sqrt(N))) ** 2)"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFind the largest square number not exceeding N.
