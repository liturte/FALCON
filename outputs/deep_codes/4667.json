The base case is when a node has no children, the score is just the number of attributes. For a node with children, the score is the sum of the scores of the node and all its child nodes. The function is called recursively on each child node. The score of the whole XML document is then printed out.\n\nThe function etree.ElementTree(etree.fromstring(xml)) is used to parse the XML from a string.

For each node, it adds the number of its attributes to the score, and then calls the function on each child node.\n\nThe function returns the total score of the XML document.\n\nThe `len(node.attrib)` expression gets the number of attributes of a node. The `for` loop iterates over the child nodes of a node.\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------------------------\n\n# Test\nprint(get_attr_number(root))", "import sys\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as etree\n\ndef get_attr_number(node):\n    score = len(node.attrib)\n    for child in node:\n        score += get_attr_number(child)\n    return score\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.stdin.readline()\n    xml = sys.stdin.read()\n    tree = etree.ElementTree(etree.fromstring(xml))\n    root = tree.getroot()\n    print(get_attr_number(root))\n\n\nIn this solution, we use recursion to traverse all the nodes in the XML document. For each node, we add the number of its attributes to the score. Finally, we return the score.\n\nThe recursive function `get_attr_number` takes a node as input and returns the score of that node. It first calculates the score of the current node by adding the number of its attributes to the score. Then, it calls itself for each child node of the current node and adds their scores to the score. The function finally returns the score.\n\nThe main", "import sys\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as etree\n\ndef get_attr_number(node):\n    return sum(len(el.attrib) for el in node.iter())\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.stdin.readline()\n    xml = sys.stdin.read()\n    tree = etree.ElementTree(etree.fromstring(xml))\n    root = tree.getroot()\n    print(get_attr_number(root))\n\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given solution, we use the xml.etree.ElementTree module to parse the XML document. The function get_attr_number(node) is used to calculate the score. It uses the iter() method to iterate over all the elements in the XML document and sum() function to calculate the total number of attributes across all elements.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Explanation:\n# The problem is to find the total number of attributes in all the elements in an XML document.

It then calculates the number of attributes for each node by getting the length of the `attrib` dictionary of the node (which contains all attributes of the node as key-value pairs). It sums up these counts to get the total score.\n\nThe rest of the code reads the XML document from the input, constructs an element tree from it, and calls the `get_attr_number` function on the root node of the tree to get the score.
