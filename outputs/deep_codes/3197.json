Not least because of the fussy participants, each of whom will only make the trip on condition that some other participant also comes.\n\nAfter some effort, you have taken from each of your participants a number, indicating that this participant will refuse to join the excursion unless the participant with that number also joins\u2013 the less choosy simply give their own number. This would be easy enough to resolve (just send all of them) but the bus you are going to use during the trip has only a fixed number of places.\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven the preferences of all participants, find the maximum number of participants that can join.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 1000$), where $n$ denotes the total number of participants and $k$ denotes the number of places on the bus.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $x_{i}$ for $i=1,2,\\ldots ,n$, where $1 \\leq x_ i \\leq n$. The meaning of $x_ i$ is that the $i$-th participant will refuse to join the excursion unless the $x_ i$-th participant also joins.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one integer: the maximum number of participants that can join the excursion, so that all the participants\u2019 preferences are obeyed and the capacity of the bus is not exceeded.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 4\n1 2 3 4\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n12 3\n2 3 4 5 6 7 4 7 8 8 12 12\nSample Output 2:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
