Students will hold on to their original cards during this process.\n\nShe\u2019s now wondering, what is the number of valid ways to do this? (It may be impossible, in which case, the answer is zero).\n\nWith sequences $abba$ and $aabb$, Ms. Thomas can choose the group $a(bba)$. With sequences $caxcab$ and $cacxab$, Ms. Thomas can choose $ca(xc)ab$ or $c(axca)b$. With sequences $a$ and $z$, there are clearly no solutions.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is two lines of lowercase letters, $A$ and $B$. The $i$-th character of $A$ and $B$ represent $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ respectively. It is guaranteed that $A$ and $B$ have the same positive length, and $A$ and $B$ are not identical. The common length is allowed to be as large as $100000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways Ms. Thomas can reverse some consecutive group of $A$ to form the line specified by string $B$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nabba\naabb\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\ncaxcab\ncacxab\nSample Output 2:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
