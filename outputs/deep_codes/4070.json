It keeps count of the number of divisions it makes, which is the number of times 2 is a factor of the number. The function `solve` takes an integer as input and returns the count. The `print` statement calls this function with the user input and prints the result.\n\nThis program is efficient because it uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. The time complexity of this program is O(log n), where n is the input number.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the input number is a positive integer.

A trailing zero is formed by pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are more 2s than 5s in the number's factorial, we just need to count the number of 5s.\n\nThe number of 5s in a number n is n // 5, but this also counts the number of 5s in multiples of 5. To avoid counting these multiples, we divide n by 5 and add the result to the count, then divide n by 25 and add the result to the count, and so on until n is 0.\n\nThis is a solution in Python. The function count_zeros counts the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number. The main program reads a number from the input, calls count_zeros with this number, and prints the result.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log n) because it divides n by 5, 25, 125, etc., until n is 0.\n\nThis solution is fast because it uses integer division (//) and the while loop, which are both fast operations in Python. It also uses a simple loop", "def count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if n / i == i:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count += 2\n        i += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(count_divisors(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a Python program that counts the number of divisors of a given number. The function `count_divisors` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of divisors. It uses a loop to check each number from 1 to the square root of `n` to see if it is a divisor. If it is, it increments the count. If the square root of `n` is a divisor, it only increments the count once, as the square root is the same as `n` divided by the other divisor. The final count is then returned. The `print` statement at the end calls the function with the input number and prints the result.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it only checks divisors up to the square root of `n`, which is the largest possible divisor of `n`. It has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is very fast for large numbers.\n\nThe solution can be further optimized by using a prime factorization method, but it's not necessary for this problem.\n\nNOTE: This solution assumes that the input", "def count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nprint(count_zeros(int(input())))\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this solution, we are counting the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number. The number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number is determined by the number of 5s in its prime factorization.\n\nWe can count the number of 5s in the prime factorization by dividing the number by 5 and adding the result to the count. We continue this process until the number is 0. The final count is the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of the original number.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because we are dividing the number by 5 in each iteration until the number is 0. The space complexity is O(1), which is constant, because we are only storing a single number (the count of trailing zeros).\n\nThe code provided above is a Python implementation of this solution.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number can be 0 or negative, you would need to add additional error checking to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, this solution uses integer division (//) which discards the fractional part. This is equivalent to performing integer division in some programming languages.\n\nThis solution", "def count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nprint(count_zeros(int(input().strip())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code is a Python solution to the problem. It calculates the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number. The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in its prime factors. Since there are always more 2s than 5s, we just need to count the number of 5s. This can be done by dividing the number by 5 and adding the result to the count. This process is repeated until the number is 0. The number of 5s in the prime factors of the factorial is the number of trailing zeros.\n\nThis solution uses integer division (//) to divide the number by 5 and get the quotient. The count is incremented by the quotient. The process continues until the number is 0. Finally, the count is printed as the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of the input number.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log n) because it repeatedly divides the number by 5 until it becomes 0. This is faster than any other solution that uses a loop to check each number from 1 to n.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space to store"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nProgrammers' kids solve this riddle in 5-10 minutes.
