In honor of the holiday the king decided to equalize the welfare of all citizens in Berland by the expense of the state treasury. \n\nTotally in Berland there are n citizens, the welfare of each of them is estimated as the integer in a_{i} burles (burle is the currency in Berland).\n\nYou are the royal treasurer, which needs to count the minimum charges of the kingdom on the king's present. The king can only give money, he hasn't a power to take away them. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of citizens in the kingdom.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014 the welfare of the i-th citizen.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the integer S\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of burles which are had to spend.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n0 1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n10\nInput\n5\n1 1 0 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n3\n1 3 1\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\n1\n12\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example if we add to the first citizen 4 burles, to the second 3, to the third 2 and to the fourth 1, then the welfare of all citizens will equal 4.\n\nIn the second example it is enough to give one burle to the third citizen. \n\nIn the third example it is necessary to give two burles to the first and the third citizens to make the welfare of citizens equal 3.\n\nIn the fourth example it is possible to give nothing to everyone because all citizens have 12 burles.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
