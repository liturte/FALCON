Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [ - k;k] (i.e. one integer among  - k,  - k + 1,  - k + 2, ...,  - 2,  - 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.\n\nMemory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k + 1)^2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Please solve this problem for Memory.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7) in one line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n1 1 1 2\n\nOutput\n31\n\nInput\n2 12 3 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2. If Lexa picks  - 2, Memory can pick 0, 1, or 2 to win. If Lexa picks  - 1, Memory can pick 1 or 2 to win. If Lexa picks 0, Memory can pick 2 to win. If Lexa picks 1 or 2, Memory cannot win. Thus, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games in which Memory wins.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
