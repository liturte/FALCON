The first and only line of each test case contains string $s$ ($2 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$). Each character $s_i$ is digit 0\u20139.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $s$ to make it good.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n95831\n100120013\n252525252525\n\nOutput\n3\n5\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, you can erase any $3$ characters, for example, the $1$-st, the $3$-rd, and the $4$-th. You'll get string 51 and it is good.\n\nIn the second test case, we can erase all characters except 0: the remaining string is 0000 and it's good.\n\nIn the third test case, the given string $s$ is already good.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
