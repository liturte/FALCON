A string is k-dominant if there are no two equal characters in a row of length at least k. This is checked by comparing every character to the next k characters. If no such characters are found, the string is k-dominant and k is returned. If all k values are checked and no k-dominant character is found, the length of the string is returned, as this is the minimum possible value of k.", "def min_k(s):\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        dominant = False\n        for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):\n            if s[i:i+k].count(s[i]) == k:\n                dominant = True\n                break\n        if dominant:\n            return k\n        k += 1\n\nprint(min_k(input()))\n\n\nThis solution works by incrementing k from 1 until we find a k-dominant character. It checks each substring of length k to see if it contains the same character as the first character of the substring. If it does, it is k-dominant and we return k. If no k-dominant character is found after incrementing k, we continue to the next iteration.\n\nThis solution is efficient as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop, where n is the length of the string. However, it should be noted that the constraints of the problem (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100000) allow for this solution to run efficiently.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this solution assumes that the input string only contains lowercase Latin letters.

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, by converting the string into a set, we automatically remove all duplicates. The length of this set is the minimum k such that there exists at least one k-dominant character. This is because each unique character in the string is a k-dominant character for some k.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input string only contains lowercase Latin letters. If the input string could contain other characters, you would need to add error checking to handle those cases.", "def min_k(s):\n    return len(set(s))\n\ns = input()\nprint(min_k(s))\n\n\nThis code works by converting the string to a set, which automatically removes duplicates. The length of this set is the number of unique characters in the string. This is the minimum value of k such that there exists at least one k-dominant character.\n\nThis code will work for any string of lowercase Latin letters with a length up to 100,000 characters.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it needs to iterate over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a set to store the unique characters.\n\nThe code reads the string from the input, calls the `min_k` function with the string as the argument, and prints the result.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input string is a valid one. If the string might contain characters that are not lowercase Latin letters, you should add error checking to handle this case.\n\nAlso, this code does not check for the case where the string is empty. If this is a possible input, you should add a check for this case.", "from collections import Counter\n\ndef minimum_k(s):\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        counts = Counter(s[i:i+k] for i in range(len(s)))\n        if max(counts.values()) >= k:\n            return k\n        k += 1\n\nprint(minimum_k(input()))\n\n\nThis solution works by checking each possible value of k, starting from 1, to see if there is a substring of length k that contains at least k instances of a character. It uses a Counter to count the number of occurrences of each substring of length k in the string s. If the maximum count is greater than or equal to k, then a k-dominant character exists, and the function returns k. If not, it increments k and checks again.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it only checks each possible value of k once, and it uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each substring of length k in linear time.\n\nPlease note that the function will return the minimum k such that there exists at least one k-dominant character, but it does not guarantee that the returned k is the minimum possible value."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
