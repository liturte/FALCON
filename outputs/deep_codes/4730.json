Sophia thinks there are too few, so she is making a programming language with only parentheses. To spice it up a bit, she is also adding square brackets (\u2018[]\u2019) and curly braces (\u2018{}\u2019) to the language.\n\nRight now, she is struggling to make people use it for production code. Obviously, it has to be because of the bad error messages you get when you mess up the delimiters! Right now, you only get the error message \u2018syntax error\u2019 when you mess them up.\n\nAny opening delimiter must be closed by the same type of delimiter: \u2018(\u2019 is closed with \u2018)\u2019, \u2018[\u2019 is closed by \u2018]\u2019, etc.\n\nSophia wants to improve the error message so that you at least get some help finding out where it all went wrong.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $|L|$, the length of the next line. The next line contains $L$, the program you want to validate.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the character and the $0$-indexed location of the first closing delimiter that does not match with the opening delimiter.\n\nIf there are no errors, or there are more opening delimiters than closing delimiters, print \u2018ok so far\u2019 instead.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $1 \\leq |L| \\leq 200$\n - $L$ contains only the characters \u2018()[]{}\u2019 and spaces\n - $L$ does not start with a space character\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n8\n([] [] ]\nSample Output 1:\n] 7\n\nSample Input 2:\n13\n(([] [[]] ())\nSample Output 2:\nok so far\n\nSample Input 3:\n21\n[ { { () () () () } ]\nSample Output 3:\n] 20\n\nSample Input 4:\n27\n[ { [[()]] (({})) } ] () {}\nSample Output 4:\nok so far\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
