Traditionally, the $555$ prefix number has been used to provide directory information and assistance as in the following examples:\n - 555-1212\n - 555-9876\n - 555-5000\n - 555-7777\n\nTelephone company switching hardware would detect the $555$ prefix and route the call to a directory information operator. Nowadays, telephone switching is done digitally and somewhere along the line a computer decides where to route calls.\n\nFor this problem, write a program that determines if a supplied seven-digit telephone number should be routed to the directory information operator, that is, the prefix number is $555$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe single line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1000000 \\le n \\le 9999999$), which is a telephone number.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is $1$ if the number should be routed to the directory information operator, or $0$ if the number should not be routed to the directory information operator.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5551212\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n5519876\nSample Output 2:\n0\n\nSample Input 3:\n5055555\nSample Output 3:\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
