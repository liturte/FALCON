She decided to write down two columns of integers\u00a0\u2014 the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.\n\nFormally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m and $(x + y) \\operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.\n\nAs usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1 000 000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 12\n\nOutput\n14\n\nInput\n11 14\n\nOutput\n31\n\nInput\n1 5\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 8\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n5 7\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n21 21\n\nOutput\n88\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFollowing pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. \n\nOnly the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
