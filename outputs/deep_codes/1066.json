He is determined to rearrange them. But there are too many natural numbers, so Volodya decided to start with the first n. He writes down the following sequence of numbers: firstly all odd integers from 1 to n (in ascending order), then all even integers from 1 to n (also in ascending order). Help our hero to find out which number will stand at the position number k.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of input contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^12).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number that will stand at the position number k after Volodya's manipulations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 3\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n7 7\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Volodya's sequence will look like this: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The third place in the sequence is therefore occupied by the number 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
