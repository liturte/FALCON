{"2372": {"code": ["from", "from", "from", "from", "from"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA maze is composed of a grid of H \\times W squares - H vertical, W horizontal.\nThe square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left - (i,j) - is a wall if S_{ij} is # and a road if S_{ij} is ..\nThere is a magician in (C_h,C_w). He can do the following two kinds of moves:\n - Move A: Walk to a road square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to the square he is currently in.\n - Move B: Use magic to warp himself to a road square in the 5\\times 5 area centered at the square he is currently in.\nIn either case, he cannot go out of the maze.\nAt least how many times does he need to use the magic to reach (D_h, D_w)?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq H,W \\leq 10^3\n - 1 \\leq C_h,D_h \\leq H\n - 1 \\leq C_w,D_w \\leq W\n - S_{ij} is # or ..\n - S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are ..\n - (C_h,C_w) \\neq (D_h,D_w)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nC_h C_w\nD_h D_w\nS_{11}\\ldots S_{1W}\n\\vdots\nS_{H1}\\ldots S_{HW}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic. If he cannot reach (D_h,D_w), print -1 instead.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 4\n1 1\n4 4\n..#.\n..#.\n.#..\n.#..\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nFor example, by walking to (2,2) and then using the magic to travel to (4,4), just one use of magic is enough.\nNote that he cannot walk diagonally.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
