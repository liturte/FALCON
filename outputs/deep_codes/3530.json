In the current theme park there are many roller coasters which then are categorized by Jimmy. He assigns a fun value to each coaster; however, the fun decreases with each run.\n\nMore formally: for a specific roller coaster $i$, Jimmy assigns two fun coefficients $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. While riding this roller coaster for the $k$-th time, Jimmy gains a fun value of $f(i,k) = a_ i - (k-1)^2 \\cdot b_ i$. If $f(i,k)$ is non-positive, riding the roller coaster is no longer fun.\n\nJimmy tries to maximize the total fun until he leaves the park. Can you tell Jimmy how much fun he can gain for a given time?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case.\n\nThe first line contains the integer $N$, where $N$ is the amount of different roller coasters in the theme park ($0< N\\le 100$).\n\nThe following $N$ lines contain the integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$ and $t_ i$ where $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ are the fun coefficients as specified above and $t_ i$ is the time for a single ride with the $i$-th roller coaster ($0\\le a_ i \\le 1000$; $0\\le b_ i \\le 1000$; $0 < t_ i \\le 25000$).\n\nThe next line contains a positive integer $Q$ denoting the number of times that Jimmy is visiting the park ($0\\le Q \\le 1000$). Each of the following $Q$ lines contains an integral time $T_ i$ that Jimmy spends during his $i$-th visit ($0\\le T_ i \\le 25000$).\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each of the $Q$ possible times, print one line containing the maximal total fun value if Jimmy spends $T_ i$ minutes in the theme park.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n5 0 5\n7 0 7\n4\n88\n5\n6\n7\nSample Output:\n88\n5\n5\n7\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
