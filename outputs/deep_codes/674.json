A string (not necessarily from this set) is called good if all elements of the set are the most frequent substrings of this string. Restore the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several such strings exist, restore lexicographically minimum string. If there are no good strings, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nA substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of letters in the string. For example, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abc\" are substrings of string \"abc\", while \"ac\" is not a substring of that string.\n\nThe number of occurrences of a substring in a string is the number of starting positions in the string where the substring occurs. These occurrences could overlap.\n\nString a is lexicographically smaller than string b, if a is a prefix of b, or a has a smaller letter at the first position where a and b differ.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings in the set.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the strings are distinct.\n\nThe total length of the strings doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several good strings exist, print lexicographically minimum among them. Print \"NO\" (without quotes) if there are no good strings.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\nmail\nai\nlru\ncf\n\nOutput\ncfmailru\n\nInput\n3\nkek\npreceq\ncheburek\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne can show that in the first sample only two good strings with minimum length exist: \"cfmailru\" and \"mailrucf\". The first string is lexicographically minimum.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
