Since the monster's health can be negative, it uses integer division (//) to round down to the nearest whole number. This ensures that Serval always makes at least one attack even if the monster's health is initially 0 or negative.\n\nIn the sample input of 10 and 4, the monster's health is 10 and the attack power is 4. The calculation `(H + A - 1) // A` becomes `(10 + 4 - 1) // 4`, which equals `3`.

This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer n such that `n * A >= H`.\n\nWe can use integer division (//) to find the smallest integer n. In Python, `a // b` gives the integer part of the division of `a` by `b`.\n\nSince we want to round up the division result (i.e., we want to get the smallest integer that is not smaller than `n`), we add `A - 1` to `H` before doing the division. This ensures that if `n * A < H`, then `(n + 1) * A >= H`.\n\nFor example, if H = 10 and A = 4, then `(H + A - 1) // A = 3`, so Serval needs to make 3 attacks to win.\n\nThis solution works because", "import sys\n\nH, A = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nprint((H + A - 1) // A)\n\n\nThis solution works by using integer division (//) to calculate the number of attacks Serval needs to make. It takes into account that the monster's health can become negative, but it doesn't matter because we're only interested in the number of attacks. The expression `(H + A - 1) // A` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to `H / A`, which is the number of attacks Serval needs to make.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is correct and that it doesn't need to handle potential exceptions or errors.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test Cases\nprint(10, 4)\nprint(100, 10)\nprint(1000, 100)\nprint(10000, 1000)\n\n\nThe output of the program should be:\n\n3\n10\n100", "H, A = map(int, input().split())\n\nprint((H + A - 1) // A)\n\n\nThis code first reads the input and splits it into H and A.
