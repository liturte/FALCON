Let us remind you just in case that an arithmetic progression is such sequence of numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n, that the following condition fulfills: a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = a_4 - a_3 = ... = a_{i} + 1 - a_{i} = ... = a_{n} - a_{n} - 1.\n\nFor example, sequences [1, 5], [10], [5, 4, 3] are arithmetic progressions and sequences [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4] are not.\n\nAlexander has n cards containing integers. Arthur wants to give Alexander exactly one more card with a number so that he could use the resulting n + 1 cards to make an arithmetic progression (Alexander has to use all of his cards).\n\nArthur has already bought a card but he hasn't written a number on it. Help him, print all integers that you can write on a card so that the described condition fulfilled.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of cards. The next line contains the sequence of integers \u2014 the numbers on Alexander's cards. The numbers are positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed 10^8.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card, print on a single line -1.\n\nOtherwise, print on the first line the number of integers that suit you. In the second line, print the numbers in the increasing order. Note that the numbers in the answer can exceed 10^8 or even be negative (see test samples).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n4 1 7\n\nOutput\n2\n-2 10\n\nInput\n1\n10\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n4\n1 3 5 9\n\nOutput\n1\n7\n\nInput\n4\n4 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n2\n2 4\n\nOutput\n3\n0 3 6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
