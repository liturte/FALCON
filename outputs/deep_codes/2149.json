You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nThe problem is about a test containing $n$ one-choice-questions. Each of the questions contains $k$ options, and only one of them is correct. The answer to the $i$-th question is $h_{i}$, and if your answer of the question $i$ is $h_{i}$, you earn $1$ point, otherwise, you earn $0$ points for this question. The values $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n$ are known to you in this problem.\n\nHowever, you have a mistake in your program. It moves the answer clockwise! Consider all the $n$ answers are written in a circle. Due to the mistake in your program, they are shifted by one cyclically.\n\nFormally, the mistake moves the answer for the question $i$ to the question $i \\bmod n + 1$. So it moves the answer for the question $1$ to question $2$, the answer for the question $2$ to the question $3$, ..., the answer for the question $n$ to the question $1$.\n\nWe call all the $n$ answers together an answer suit. There are $k^n$ possible answer suits in total.\n\nYou're wondering, how many answer suits satisfy the following condition: after moving clockwise by $1$, the total number of points of the new answer suit is strictly larger than the number of points of the old one. You need to find the answer modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$, and your answer suit is $a=[1,2,3,4,5]$, it will submitted as $a'=[5,1,2,3,4]$ because of a mistake. If the correct answer suit is $h=[5,2,2,3,4]$, the answer suit $a$ earns $1$ point and the answer suite $a'$ earns $4$ points. Since $4 > 1$, the answer suit $a=[1,2,3,4,5]$ should be counted.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2000$, $1 \\le k \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of questions", "QUESTION:\nYour program fails again.
