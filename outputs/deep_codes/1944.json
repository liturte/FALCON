Dima thinks that the more expensive a laptop is, the better it is. Alex disagrees. Alex thinks that there are two laptops, such that the price of the first laptop is less (strictly smaller) than the price of the second laptop but the quality of the first laptop is higher (strictly greater) than the quality of the second laptop.\n\nPlease, check the guess of Alex. You are given descriptions of n laptops. Determine whether two described above laptops exist.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of laptops.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers each, a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n), where a_{i} is the price of the i-th laptop, and b_{i} is the number that represents the quality of the i-th laptop (the larger the number is, the higher is the quality).\n\nAll a_{i} are distinct. All b_{i} are distinct. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Alex is correct, print \"Happy Alex\", otherwise print \"Poor Alex\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\nHappy Alex\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
