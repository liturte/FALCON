If it is, it prints 'Yes', meaning the air conditioner will be turned on. If X is less than 30, it prints 'No', meaning the air conditioner will not be turned on.\n\nThis is a simple if-else statement in Python. It's used to make decisions based on whether a condition is true or false.\n\nIn this case, the condition is whether X is greater than or equal to 30. If the condition is true, the air conditioner will be turned on. If the condition is false, the air conditioner will not be turned on.\n\nThe input is read using the `input()` function. The `int()` function is used to convert the input string to an integer. The result is then printed using the `print()` function.\n\nThis code is a good example of how to use Python to solve a simple problem.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the input will always be a valid integer between -40 and 40. If this is not the case, the code should be modified to handle invalid inputs.\n\nAlso note that this code does not account for any potential errors that might occur if the input is not a valid integer. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to add additional error checking code.\n\nFinally, this code does not", "X = int(input())\nif X >= 30:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads an integer X from the standard input and checks if it is greater than or equal to 30. If it is, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nThis is a simple decision making problem. If the temperature is 30 degrees or above, we turn on the air conditioner, otherwise we do not.\n\nPlease note that Python uses indentation to define the scope of the code blocks. So the body of the if and else statements should be properly indented.\n\nAlso, Python's input function returns a string, so we need to convert it to an integer using the int function.", "X = int(input())\nif X >= 30:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads the current temperature from the standard input and converts it to an integer. Then it checks if the temperature is 30 degrees or above. If it is, it prints \"Yes\" to turn on the air conditioner, otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nIn the given sample input, the temperature is 25 degrees, which is not 30 or above, so the output is \"No\".\n\nThis program works by using a simple if-else statement to check the temperature and print the appropriate message.", "X = int(input())\nif X >= 30:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code will take the input temperature X from the user, check if it is 30 degrees or above, and then print 'Yes' if it is or 'No' otherwise.\n\nNote: This code does not check if the input is within the constraints -40 <= X <= 40. This should be checked before the input is taken, or it could result in an error.", "X = int(input())\nif X >= 30:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis is a simple if-else statement. If the temperature (X) is 30 degrees or above, it prints 'Yes' meaning you should turn on the air conditioner. If not, it prints 'No' meaning you should not turn on the air conditioner.\n\nThe input is read using the built-in function input() and converted to an integer using the int() function. The result is then compared to 30 using the >= operator, and the appropriate string is printed depending on the result.\n\nThe code assumes that the input will always be a valid integer within the constraints specified in the problem statement.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\nX = int(input())\nif X >= 30:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution is correct as it adheres to the problem statement and constraints.
