Both of them have one algorithm they have to explain to each team. Of course, both can\u2019t work with the same team at the same time and none of them can work with multiple teams simultaneously.\n\nYou are given the time it takes for each team to understand and implement an algorithm. Each algorithm lecture has to be done without interruption. Determine the minimal time required for Ante and Goran to do their lectures!\n\nFor additional explanation, consult the sample test clarifications.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$, the number of teams.\n\nThe following line contains $N$ space separated integers, where the $i$\u2019th integer denotes the time required for the $i$\u2019th team to understand and implement an algorithm.\n\nAll numbers in the input belong to the interval $[1, 3 \\cdot 10^5]$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required number from the task.\n\nClarification of the first example: Each team needs $2$ units of time to understand and implement an algorithm. One of the possible schedules is that Ante gives his lectures to team $1$, team $2$ and team $3$, respectively, and Goran to team $3$, team $1$ and team $2$, respectively.\n\nClarification of the second example: One of the optimal schedules is that Ante gives lectures to team $2$, team $3$ and team $1$, respectively, but with a pause lasting $1$ unit of time between team $3$ and team $1$. Goran will give lectures to team $1$, team $3$ and team $2$, respectively.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2 2 2\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n4 1 2\nSample Output 2:\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
