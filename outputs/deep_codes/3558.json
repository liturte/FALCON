The city can be represented as a segment of the length $D$ on which there are buildings of different heights. The width of a building is negligible. On top of some buildings, television transmitters are set, their dimensions are also negligible.\n\nTelevision transmitters emit a television signal in all directions around them. The signal is spread through space in straight lines and cannot pass through buildings. A certain point in the city is considered covered if it is reached by a signal from an existing transmitter.\n\n\nFind the segment of the city covered by television signal and output its length.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$), the number of buildings, and the integer $D$ ($1 \\leq D \\leq 10^9$), the city length.\n\nEach of the following N lines contains three numbers which describe the $i$-th building:\n - a number which determines whether there is a transmitter on top of the building: 0 (no) or 1 (yes)\n - an integer $X_ i$ ($0 \\leq X_ i \\leq D$), the distance between the building and the left end of the city\n - an integer $H_ i$ ($1 \\leq H_ i \\leq 10^9$), the building height\n\nThe buildings are sorted in ascending order by the distance from the left end of the city. No two buildings will be located on the same distance from the left end of the city.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required length from the text. Note: the maximum permissible deviation from the official solution is 10-3 in absolute value.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 10\n1 2 6\n0 4 3\n0 8 2\nSample Output:\n6.000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
