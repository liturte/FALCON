{"4915": {"code": ["QUESTION:\nOur new contest submission system keeps a chronological log of all submissions made by each team during the contest. With each entry, it records the number of minutes into the competition at which the submission was received, the letter that identifies the relevant contest problem, and the result of testing the submission (designated for the sake of this problem simply as right or wrong). As an example, the following is a hypothetical log for a particular team:\n\n3 E right\n10 A wrong\n30 C wrong\n50 B wrong\n100 A wrong\n200 A right\n250 C wrong\n300 D right\n\nThe rank of a team relative to others is determined by a primary and secondary scoring measure calculated from the submission data. The primary measure is the number of problems that were solved. The secondary measure is based on a combination of time and penalties. Specifically, a team\u2019s time score is equal to the sum of those submission times that resulted in right answers, plus a 20-minute penalty for each wrong submission of a problem that is ultimately solved. If no problems are solved, the time measure is\u00a0$0$.\n\nIn the above example, we see that this team successfully completed three problems: E on their first attempt ($3$\u00a0minutes into the contest); A on their third attempt at that problem ($200$\u00a0minutes into the contest); and D on their first attempt at that problem ($300$\u00a0minutes into the contest). This team\u2019s time score (including penalties) is $543$. This is computed to include $3$\u00a0minutes for solving E, $200$\u00a0minutes for solving A with an additional $40$\u00a0penalty minutes for two earlier mistakes on that problem, and finally $300$\u00a0minutes for solving D. Note that the team also attempted problems B and C, but were never successful in solving those problems, and thus received no penalties for those attempts.\n\nAccording to contest rules, after a team solves a particular problem, any further submissions of the same problem are ignored (and thus omitted from the log). Because times are discretized to whole minutes, there may be more than one submission showing the same number of minutes. In particular there could be more than one submission of the same problem in the same minute, but they are chronological, so only the last entry could possibly be correct. As a second example, consider the following submission log:\n\n7 H right\n15 B wrong\n30 E wrong\n35 E right\n80 B wrong\n80 B right\n100 D wrong\n100 C wrong\n300 C right\n300 D wrong\n\nThis team solved 4 problems, and their time", "QUESTION:\nOur new contest submission system keeps a chronological log of all submissions made by each team during the contest.
