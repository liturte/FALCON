His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line, with each plant occupying a single point on that line.\n\nEmuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature, so he wants to arrange m - 1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into m sections numbered from 1 to m from left to right with each section housing a single species. He is free to place the borders, but in the end all of the i-th species plants must reside in i-th section from the left.\n\nOf course, it is not always possible to place the borders in such way, so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants. He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse (at any real coordinate) with no plant already in it.
