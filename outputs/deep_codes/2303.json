The `split()` function is used to split the string `s` into a list of words. By default, it splits the string at every whitespace character.

The split function by default splits on whitespaces and returns a list of words. The reversed() function reverses the order of the elements in the list. Finally, the ' '.join() function concatenates all the words in the list into a string with", "class Solution:\n    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:\n        return ' '.join(reversed(s.split()))\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\n# The solution splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method. The split() method will automatically remove any leading or trailing spaces and multiple spaces between words. \n# The reversed() function is then used to reverse the order of the words. Finally, the words are joined together with a single space in"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\n\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\n\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\n\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"the sky is blue\"\nOutput: \"blue is sky the\"\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"  hello world  \"\nOutput: \"world hello\"\nExplanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"a good   example\"\nOutput: \"example good a\"\nExplanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\nExample 4:\n\nInput: s = \"  Bob    Loves  Alice   \"\nOutput: \"Alice Loves Bob\"\nExample 5:\n\nInput: s = \"Alice does not even like bob\"\nOutput: \"bob like even not does Alice\"\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.\nThere is at least one word in s.\nSTARTER CODE:\nclass Solution:\n    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:\n        \n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
