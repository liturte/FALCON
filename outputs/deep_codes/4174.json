It starts with the first bounce at coordinate 0. Then, for each subsequent bounce, it adds the length of the previous bounce to the last coordinate in the list D and checks if the new coordinate is greater than X. If it is, it subtracts the length of the current bounce from the last coordinate in the list D and stops the loop. Finally, it prints the length of the list D minus 1, which represents the number of bounces where", "N, X = map(int, input().split())\nL = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nD = [0] * (N + 1)\nfor i in range(1, N + 1):\n    D[i] = D[i - 1] + L[i - 1]\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N + 1):\n    if D[i] <= X:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis program first reads the number of bounces N, the maximum coordinate X, and the bounce lengths L.

Then, it calculates the next bounce coordinates by adding the previous bounce coordinate to the corresponding L_i. Finally, it counts the number of bounces where the coordinate is at most X by summing up 1 for each bounce coordinate that is less than or equal to X. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N", "N, X = map(int, input().split())\nL = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    total += L[i]\n    if total > X:\n        print(i)\n        break\nelse:\n    print(N)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads the number of bounces `N`, the maximum possible coordinate `X`, and the list of distances `L` for each bounce.\n\nIt then calculates the total distance covered by the ball by summing up the distances in the list. If the total distance is greater than `X`, it prints the current index and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without breaking, it means the ball made `N` bounces and the total distance is less than or equal to `X`, so it prints `N`.\n\nThis solution assumes that the distances are increasing, as per the problem", "N, X = map(int, input().split())\nL = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncoordinates = [0]\nfor i in range(N):\n    coordinates.append(coordinates[-1] + L[i])\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N+1):\n    if coordinates[i] <= X:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program first reads the input and stores the bounce coordinates in a list. Then it iterates through the list and counts the number of bounces where the coordinate is at most X.
