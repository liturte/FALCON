Initially, all bulbs are turned off. There are n buttons, each of them is connected to some set of bulbs. Vasya can press any of these buttons. When the button is pressed, it turns on all the bulbs it's connected to. Can Vasya light up all the bulbs?\n\nIf Vasya presses the button such that some bulbs connected to it are already turned on, they do not change their state, i.e. remain turned on.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of buttons and the number of bulbs respectively. \n\nEach of the next n lines contains x_{i} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 m)\u00a0\u2014 the number of bulbs that are turned on by the i-th button, and then x_{i} numbers y_{ij} (1 \u2264 y_{ij} \u2264 m)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of these bulbs.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it's possible to turn on all m bulbs print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n2 1 4\n3 1 3 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 1\n1 2\n1 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample you can press each button once and turn on all the bulbs. In the 2 sample it is impossible to turn on the 3-rd lamp.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
