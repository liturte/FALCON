X is the cost of the train ticket and Y is the cost of the bus ticket. \nThe cost of the bus ticket with the discount is Y // 2, which is the integer division of Y by 2. \nThe total cost is the sum of the train and bus costs, i.e., X + Y // 2. \nThe result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works for all cases as the constraints 1 <= X,Y <= 100 and Y is an even number ensure that the input is valid.\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a list of integers.

The special ticket allows us to take the bus for half the fare if we travel from Station A to Station B by train. So, we first input the train fare and the bus fare, then we calculate the cost of the bus fare with the 50% discount. Finally, we add the train fare and the discounted bus fare to get the total cost.\n\nIn Python, we use the `map` function to input two integers separated by a space, and the `//` operator for integer division to get the half of the bus fare. We then print the total cost.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be valid, as specified in the problem constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\n# --------\n# 1", "X, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X + Y // 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe first line of the code reads the input. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the input, converting them all to integers. The `split` function splits the input by spaces, resulting in a list of two elements. These are assigned to `X` and `Y`, respectively.\n\nThe second line of the code calculates the total cost. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it will always round down to the nearest whole number. So `Y // 2` will give half the cost of the bus, rounded down. This cost is added to the cost of the train to give the total cost. The `print` function then outputs this total cost.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always in the correct format. If it might not be, additional error checking could be added.", "X, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X + Y // 2)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads the fare for the train and bus from the input. Since the bus fare is discounted by 50%, we divide it by 2 to get the actual fare. Then, we add the train fare and the discounted bus fare to get the total fare. The result is printed to the output.\n\nThe `map` function is used to read two integers from the input. The `split` function is used to split the input string by spaces, and `int` is used to convert the resulting strings to integers. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which returns the quotient of the division. The `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThe code is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. It is designed to be easy to read and write, which"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere is a train going from Station A to Station B that costs X yen (the currency of Japan).\nAlso, there is a bus going from Station B to Station C that costs Y yen.\nJoisino got a special ticket.
