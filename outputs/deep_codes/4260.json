This is the amount of time that will pass in World A.\n\nThis is because in World B, time passes X times as fast as in World A, so for every 1 hour in World B, 1/X hours in World A pass. Therefore, to find out how many hours in World A pass for T hours in World B, we divide T by X.\n\nThis script should satisfy the problem constraints, as it ensures that all input values are integers and that T and X are in the range 1 to 100.", "T, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(T / X)\n\n\nExplanation:\nIn World B, T hours pass. If time passes X times faster in World B than in World A, then 1 hour in World B corresponds to X hours in World A. Therefore, the number of hours in World A that pass is T divided by X.\n\"\"\"\n\nT, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(T / X)\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"", "T, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(T / X)\n\n\nThis Python program reads the input values T and X. Then it calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A by dividing T by X and prints the result.\n\nIn the context of the problem, the number of hours in World B that pass in World A is the ratio of the time in World B to the time in World A. So the program divides the time in World B by the time in World A to get this ratio.\n\nThe output is a floating-point number, which is the time in World A. The error is within the required tolerance of 10^{-3} due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic.", "T, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(T / X)\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `map` function to convert the input strings into integers, and the `input().split()` function to split the input line into a list of strings. It then divides the number of hours Taro studies in World B by the time factor X to find the number of hours that will pass in World A. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), meaning it takes a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), meaning it uses a constant amount of additional space.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified constraints. If this is not the case, additional error checking or input validation should be added.", "T, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint(T / X)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads two integers from the input, T and X. It then prints the value of T divided by X. Since time in World A passes at a rate of 1/X of the rate it does in World B, the time in World A that will pass is T divided by X.\n\nThis program uses the map function to read the two integers from the input, and the split function to split the input string on whitespace. The print function then outputs the result.\n\nThe result is printed as a floating point number, since the rate of time passing in World A is not an integer number of times per hour.\n\nThe program does not contain any loops or conditionals, so it will run in constant time, i.e., O(1).\n\nThe program does not contain any floating point arithmetic"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn order to pass the entrance examination tomorrow, Taro has to study for T more hours.\nFortunately, he can leap to World B where time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).\nWhile (X \\times t) hours pass in World B, t hours pass in World A.\nHow many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq T \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq X \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT X\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of hours that will pass in World A.\nThe output will be regarded as correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2.6666666667\n\nWhile Taro studies for eight hours in World B where time passes three times as fast, 2.6666... hours will pass in World A.\nNote that an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-3} is allowed.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
