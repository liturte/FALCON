{"189": {"code": ["n", "def", "def", "def", "from"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSalem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n\nFor every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.\n\nA stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \\le 1$.\n\nSalem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. \n\nAs an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of the sticks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n10 1 4\n\nOutput\n3 7\n\nInput\n5\n1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput\n2 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.\n\nIn the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
