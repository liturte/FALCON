In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by a_{i}. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.\n\nNow Arkady's field has size h \u00d7 w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a \u00d7 b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains five integers a, b, h, w and n (1 \u2264 a, b, h, w, n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (2 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100 000), where a_{i} equals the integer a side multiplies by when the i-th extension is applied.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 2 4 4\n2 5 4 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 3 3 3 5\n2 3 5 4 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n5 5 1 2 3\n2 2 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 4 1 1 3\n2 3 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge h in 5 times using the second extension. Then h becomes equal 10 and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
