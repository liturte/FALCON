In the second test case, the only free compartment in the train is compartment 3 in the first car (places 9, 10, 11, 12, 49 and 50 are all free). In the third test case, the train is still absolutely free; as there are 20 ways to sell 3 tickets in an empty compartment, the answer is 2 * 9 * 20 = 360.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
