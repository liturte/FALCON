It then iterates over each operation in the string, incrementing or decrementing the value of x accordingly. If the value of x is greater than the current maximum value, it updates the maximum value. Finally, it prints the maximum value of x.\n\nIn the given sample input, the operations are \"IIDID\", so the values of x are 1, 2, 1, 2, and 1. The maximum value of x is 2, so the program prints 2.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the string S, because it iterates over each character", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\nx = 0\nmax_x = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    if S[i] == \"I\":\n        x += 1\n    else:\n        x -= 1\n    if x > max_x:\n        max_x = x\nprint(max_x)\n\n\nThis code reads the input, then iterates through the string S. It checks each character in the string, and if it's 'I', it increments x by 1, and if it's 'D', it decrements x by 1. It also keeps track of the maximum value of x, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input is always valid according to the problem constraints.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the length of the string S. This is because it performs a constant amount of work for each character in the string. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\nx = 0\nmax_x = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    if S[i] == 'I':\n        x += 1\n    else:\n        x -= 1\n    if x > max_x:\n        max_x = x\nprint(max_x)\n\n\nThis code first reads the number of operations N and the string of operations S from the standard input. It then initializes x and max_x to 0. For each operation, it increments or decrements x depending on the operation (I for increment and D for decrement), and if the new value of x is greater than max_x, it updates max_x. Finally, it prints the maximum value of x.", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\nx = 0\nmax_x = 0\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    if S[i] == 'I':\n        x += 1\n    else:\n        x -= 1\n    if x > max_x:\n        max_x = x\n\nprint(max_x)\n\n\nThe above code first takes an input of the number of operations `N` and the string `S`. It then initializes `x` and `max_x` to 0. It then iterates through each character in the string, incrementing `x` by 1 if the character is 'I', and decrementing `x` by 1 if the character is 'D'. If `x` is greater than `max_x`, it updates `max_x`. Finally, it prints out the maximum value of `x`.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not include any error checking or exception handling.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(N) as it", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\nx = 0\nmax_x = 0\nfor i in S:\n    if i == 'I':\n        x += 1\n    else:\n        x -= 1\n    if x > max_x:\n        max_x = x\nprint(max_x)\n\n\nThis code reads the number of operations `N` and the string of operations `S`. It then iterates over each character in `S`, incrementing `x` by 1 if the character is 'I', and decrementing `x` by 1 if the character is 'D'. If `x` becomes greater than `max_x`, it updates `max_x` with the new value of `x`. Finally, it prints the maximum value of `x`.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is in the correct format as described in the problem statement. It does not check for any potential errors in the input.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work correctly if the input is not in the correct format.
