Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by $k$ and this sum is the maximum.\n\nIn other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by $k$.\n\nNote that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is $0$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, m, k \\le 70$) \u2014 the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of $k$. The next $n$ lines contain $m$ elements each, where the $j$-th element of the $i$-th row is $a_{i, j}$ ($1 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 70$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum sum divisible by $k$ you can obtain.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4 3\n1 2 3 4\n5 2 2 2\n7 1 1 4\n\nOutput\n24\n\nInput\n5 5 4\n1 2 4 2 1\n3 5 1 2 4\n1 5 7 1 2\n3 8 7 1 2\n8 4 7 1 6\n\nOutput\n56\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the optimal answer is $2$ and $4$ in the first row, $5$ and $2$ in the second row and $7$ and $4$ in the third row. The total sum is $2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
