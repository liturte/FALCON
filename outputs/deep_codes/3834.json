Sereja wants his table to meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of size h \u00d7 w, then the component must contain exactly hw cells.\n\nA connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions:  every two cells of the set have the same value;  the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table);  it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions. \n\nCan Sereja change the values of at most k cells of the table so that the table met the described requirement? What minimum number of table cells should he change in this case?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100;\u00a01 \u2264 k \u2264 10). Next n lines describe the table a: the i-th of them contains m integers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im} (0 \u2264 a_{i}, j \u2264 1) \u2014 the values in the cells of the i-th row.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint -1, if it is impossible to meet the requirement. Otherwise, print the minimum number of cells which should be changed.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5 2\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 4 1\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 4 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
