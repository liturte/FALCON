The phones usually try to compensate this by making use of a dictionary \u2013 basically, the idea is that there will typically be relatively few actual words having the same button combination. The way this works is that when you have typed a certain digit sequence, you can cycle through the words in the dictionary that map to this digit sequence using the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d buttons. Pressing \u201cup\u201d gives you the next word, and pressing \u201cdown\u201d gives you the previous word. Words are ordered by how common they are, most common words first and least common words last. This wraps, so that pressing \u201cup\u201d at the last word gives you the first word and similarly for \u201cdown\u201d. Initially after having pressed a digit sequence, you will get the first (most common) word that maps to this sequence.\n\nThis usually works quite well, but if you\u2019re trying to type a word that does not exist in the dictionary, you have to write it by separating it into several parts, where each part is a word in the dictionary. In order to start writing a new part, you have to press the \u201cright\u201d button on the keypad.\n\nObviously, the number of keys needed to type a word depends on how (and if) we divide it into parts. Now, I would like to know how to type a word (that may or may not be from the dictionary) using as few key presses as possible (it\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy, I just want to decrease the wear and tear of my keypad).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with an integer $1 \\le N \\le 200000$ giving the size of the dictionary, followed by $N$ lines, giving the words of the dictionary from most common to least common.
