Given a message and key of equal length, all you need to do to encrypt the message is shift each character forward by a certain number of characters in the alphabet.\n\nFor example, if your string is CALGARY and key is ALBERTA, the number of letters to shift the $i$-th letter in the message is given by the position in the alphabet of the $i$-th letter in the key, using $0$-based indexing. So the first character in our message C is shifted $0$ letters forward since the first character in our key is A. Likewise, A is shifted $11$ characters since L is the $11$-th letter in the alphabet. Repeating for each character, we\u2019ll find the encrypted message ends up being CLMKRKY.\n\nOf course since this is such a well known encryption method, it isn\u2019t very safe so your friend Yraglac has come up with a brilliant idea: for each even-indexed character in your message, you do the usual encryption as described above, but for the odd-indexed characters, instead of shifting forwards by the key, you actually shift backwards. Thus, our example above would actually be encrypted as CPMCRYY. That\u2019ll throw off any pesky hackers trying to read your secrets!\n\nOf course Yraglac has left the implementation up to you. Given an encrypted message and the key, can you write a program to decrypt it? Don\u2019t forget that everything is using $0$-based indexing.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of two lines. The first contains the encrypted message $C$ and the second contains the key $K$. $C$ and $K$ are always of equal length between $1$ and $200$ characters long and consists only of uppercase alphabetic letters.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the decrypted message.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nCPMCRYY\nALBERTA\nSample Output:\nCALGARY\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
