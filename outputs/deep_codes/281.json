Here a! denotes the factorial of integer a, that is, a! = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 a. Specifically, 0! = 1.\n\nKoyomi doesn't care much about this, but before he gets into another mess with oddities, he is interested in the number of times the phoenix will reincarnate in a timespan of b! years, that is, [Image]. Note that when b \u2265 a this value is always integer.\n\nAs the answer can be quite large, it would be enough for Koyomi just to know the last digit of the answer in decimal representation. And you're here to provide Koyomi with this knowledge.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers a and b (0 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 10^18).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one line containing a single decimal digit\u00a0\u2014 the last digit of the value that interests Koyomi.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n0 10\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n107 109\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the last digit of $\\frac{4 !}{2 !} = 12$ is 2;\n\nIn the second example, the last digit of $\\frac{10 !}{0 !} = 3628800$ is 0;\n\nIn the third example, the last digit of $\\frac{109 !}{107 !} = 11772$ is 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
