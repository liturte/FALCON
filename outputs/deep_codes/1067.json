With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:\n\nChoose one of these numbers and add or subtract $1$ from it.\n\nIn particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.\n\nWe want to make the product of all these numbers equal to $1$, in other words, we want $a_1 \\cdot a_2$ $\\dots$ $\\cdot a_n = 1$. \n\nFor example, for $n = 3$ and numbers $[1, -3, 0]$ we can make product equal to $1$ in $3$ coins: add $1$ to second element, add $1$ to second element again, subtract $1$ from third element, so that array becomes $[1, -1, -1]$. And $1\\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of numbers.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single number\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of coins you need to pay to make the product equal to $1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n-1 1\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n4\n0 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\n5\n-5 -3 5 3 0\n\nOutput\n13\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can change $1$ to $-1$ or $-1$ to $1$ in $2$ coins.\n\nIn the second example, you have to apply at least $4$ operations for the product not to be $0$.\n\nIn the third example, you can change $-5$ to $-1$ in $4$ coins, $-3$ to $-1$ in $2$ coins, $5$ to $1$ in $4$ coins, $3$ to $1$ in $2$ coins, $0$ to $1$ in $1$ coin.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
