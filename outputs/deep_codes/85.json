Besides, he wants to show that Polycarpus's mind and Paraskevi's beauty are equally matched, so the two bars must have the same number of squares.\n\nTo make the bars have the same number of squares, Polycarpus eats a little piece of chocolate each minute. Each minute he does the following:  he either breaks one bar exactly in half (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a half of the bar,  or he chips of exactly one third of a bar (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a third of the bar. \n\nIn the first case he is left with a half, of the bar and in the second case he is left with two thirds of the bar.\n\nBoth variants aren't always possible, and sometimes Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third. For example, if the bar is 16 \u00d7 23, then Polycarpus can chip off a half, but not a third. If the bar is 20 \u00d7 18, then Polycarpus can chip off both a half and a third. If the bar is 5 \u00d7 7, then Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes Polycarpus needs to make two bars consist of the same number of squares?
