And not even the single one but two at the same time! \n\nAlice has a sheet with n notes written on it. She wants to take two such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.\n\nSubsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nSubsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differs by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.\n\nYou should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5000).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5) \u2014 notes written on a sheet.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 4 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n6\n62 22 60 61 48 49\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example subsequences [1, 2] and [4, 5] give length 4 in total.\n\nIn the second example subsequences [62, 48, 49] and [60, 61] give length 5 in total. If you choose subsequence [62, 61] in the first place then the second melody will have maximum length 2, that gives the result of 4, which is not maximal.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
