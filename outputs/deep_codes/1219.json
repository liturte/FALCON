In order to accomplish his goal, he can pick two consecutive heroes, with powers $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$, remove them and insert a hero with power $-(a_i+a_{i+1})$ back in the same position. \n\nFor example if the array contains the elements $[5, 6, 7, 8]$, he can pick $6$ and $7$ and get $[5, -(6+7), 8] = [5, -13, 8]$.\n\nAfter he will perform this operation $n-1$ times, Mans will end up having only one hero. He wants his power to be as big as possible. What's the largest possible power he can achieve?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 200000$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 powers of the heroes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the largest possible power he can achieve after $n-1$ operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n5 6 7 8\n\nOutput\n26\n\nInput\n5\n4 -5 9 -2 1\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nSuitable list of operations for the first sample:\n\n$[5, 6, 7, 8] \\rightarrow [-11, 7, 8] \\rightarrow [-11, -15] \\rightarrow [26]$\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
