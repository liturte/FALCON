The function takes the order as input and returns the number of cells. If the order is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of cells in a (n-1)th order rhombus and adds the number of cells in a nth order rhombus (4*n^2 - 3*n + 1). The result is then printed.", "def nth_order_rhombus(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 4*nth_order_rhombus(n-1) - (n-1)*(n-1)\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(nth_order_rhombus(n))\n\n\nThis code uses a recursive function to calculate the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus. The base case is n=1, where the function returns 1. For n > 1, the function returns 4 times the number of cells in a (n-1)-th order rhombus, minus the number of cells in the smaller rhombus that is subtracted from the calculation.\n\nThe input is read from the user, and the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus is printed.", "def cells_in_nth_order_rhombus(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 4 * n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(cells_in_nth_order_rhombus(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of cells in a n-th order rhombus can be calculated using the formula `4 * n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)`. This formula is derived by observing that each n-th order rhombus has 4 times the number of cells of the (n-1)-th order rhombus plus the cells of the (n-1)-th order rhombus with common sides. The term `(n - 1)", "def rhombus_cells(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 4 * n * n - 3 * n + 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(rhombus_cells(n))\n\nThis solution uses a mathematical formula to calculate the number of cells in a rhombus of order n. The formula is `4 * n * n - 3 * n + 1`, which is derived from the observation that each cell of a square of side length n contributes 4 * n * n cells to the rhombus, and there are 4 * n * n cells in a square of side length n. The -3 * n + 1 term is to account for the cells that are not part of the rhombus but are adjacent to it.\n\nThe function rhombus_cells takes an integer n as", "def cells_in_nth_order_rhombus(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 4*n**2 - 3*n + 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(cells_in_nth_order_rhombus(n))\n\n\nExplanation:\nFor a 1-st order rhombus, there is 1 cell.\nFor a n-th order rhombus, there are 4*n^2 - 3*n + 1 cells. This formula is derived from the pattern of cells in a rhombus. For a 2-nd order rhombus, there are 5 cells (1 + 4 + 4 + 1), for a 3-rd order rhombus, there are 13 cells (1 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 +"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWhile playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a $n$-th order rhombus in a cell grid.\n\nA $1$-st order rhombus is just a square $1 \\times 1$ (i.e just a cell).\n\nA $n$-th order rhombus for all $n \\geq 2$ one obtains from a $n-1$-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).\n\n [Image] \n\nAlex asks you to compute the number of cells in a $n$-th order rhombus.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only input line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint exactly one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in a $n$-th order rhombus.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n13\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nImages of rhombus corresponding to the examples are given in the statement.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
