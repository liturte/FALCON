You have come up with a formula to measure the \u201cvalue\u201d of the final mixture: $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$, where $F$ is the rate of incoming Flubber in liters/second, $W$ is the rate of incoming water in liters/second, and $a$ is a given constant between $0$ and $1$.\n\nDetermine the maximum value of $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$ that can be achieved and how to route the Flubber and water to achieve it.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line containing the number of locations $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 200$), the number of pipes $p$ ($n-1 \\leq p \\leq \\tfrac {1}{2}n(n-1)$), and the real values $v$ ($1 \\leq v \\leq 10$) and $a$ ($0.01 \\leq a \\leq 0.99$). Locations are numbered from $1$ to $n$; $1$ is the Flubber factory, $2$ is the water source, and $3$ is the FD. The real values have at most $10$ digits after the decimal point.\n\nThe following $p$ lines each describe one pipe. Each line contains two integers $j$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq j < k \\leq n$), giving the locations connected by the pipe, and an integer $c$ ($1 \\leq c \\leq 10$), giving the water capacity of the pipe in liters/second.\n\nNo two pipes connect the same pair of locations. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that the network is connected.\n\n-----Output-----\nFirst, for each pipe (in the order given in the input), display two values: the rate of Flubber moving through it, and the rate of water moving through it (negative if the liquid is moving from $k$ to $j$), such that $F^a \\cdot W^{1-a}$ is maximized. Then display that maximum value accurate to within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, any one will be accepted. All constraints (not sending Flubber and water in opposite directions along the same pipe, flow conservation, pipe capacities, and consistency between the constructed solution and its claimed value) must be satisfied within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6 6 3.0 0.66\n2 4 8\n4 6 1\n3 6 1\n4 5 5\n1 5 7\n3 5 3\nSample Output:\n0.000000000 1.360000000\n0.000000000 1.000000000\n0.000000000 -1.000000000\n0.000000000 0.360000000\n0.880000000 0.000000000\n-0.880000000 -0.360000000\n1.02037965897\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
