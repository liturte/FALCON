The deck is split into two stacks, which are then interleaved with each other. The deck can be split anywhere, and the two stacks can be interleaved in any way.\n\nFor example, consider a deck with 10 unique cards:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nSplit them somewhere\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07 8 9 10\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd interleave them in some way:\n\n1 2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a07\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0\u00a0 8 9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a04 5\u00a0\u00a0 10\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDo it again. Split them somewhere:\n\n1 2 7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 8 9 4 5 10 6\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd interleave them in some way:\n\n3 8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01\u00a0\u00a0 9 4 5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02 7\u00a0\u00a0 10 6\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is one possible ordering after $2$ shuffles. Suppose there are $n$ unique cards, and that they start out perfectly ordered: $1, 2, 3, ..., n$. Given an ordering of the deck, what is the smallest number of shuffles that could possibly put the deck in that order?\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will begin with a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000000$) indicating the number of cards in the deck. On the next line will be $n$ unique integers $c$ ($1 \\le c \\le n$), with a single space between them, indicating an ordering of the $n$ cards. The values $c$ are guaranteed to be a permutation of the numbers $1 \\ldots n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with a single integer indicating the minimum number of shuffles that could possibly put the deck in the given order.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n10\n1 2 7 3 8 9 4 5 10 6\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n10\n3 8 1 9 4 5 2 7 10 6\nSample Output 2:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
