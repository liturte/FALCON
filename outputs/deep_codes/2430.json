There are n trees (numbered 1 to n from west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the tree i is h_{i}. Liss wants to eat all nuts.\n\nNow Liss is on the root of the tree with the number 1. In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:  Walk up or down one unit on a tree.  Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.  Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height h of the tree i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1), she jumps to height h of the tree i + 1. This action can't be performed if h > h_{i} + 1. \n\nCompute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1  \u2264  n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of trees.\n\nNext n lines contains the height of trees: i-th line contains an integer h_{i} (1 \u2264 h_{i} \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the height of the tree with the number i.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n5\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n14\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
