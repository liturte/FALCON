He drilled a bunch of holes in a piece of wood. As the name of the game suggests the holes were on the boundary of a convex polygon. After turning over the piece of wood, Dezider froze\u2014he had damaged the famous Picasso lithograph\u2014The Bull No.\u00a08. Now the question is: how to fix the damage? Drawing a bunch of straight lines to cover the holes seems like a good repair method but, of course, Dezider would like to draw as few lines as possible. He needs your help. Write a program that, given the positions of the holes, finds the smallest number of straight lines that can cover the holes.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe only input line starts with $n$, the number of holes. Then $2n$ numbers, the coordinates of the holes, follow. You can assume that $3 \\leq n \\leq 1000$ and the coordinates are integers between $-1000000$ and $1000000$. The holes lie on the boundary of a convex polygon.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains one line with the smallest number $\\ell $, such that $\\ell $ straight lines can cover the holes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\nSample Output:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
