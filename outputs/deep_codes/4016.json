{"4016": {"code": ["n, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * k)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution is very simple. We just need to take the input string `t`, multiply it by `k` to get the required string `s` and then print it. This will result in `k` substrings of `s` that are equal to `t`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n).", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * ((k + 1) // 2))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is straightforward. We just need to repeat the string `t` enough times to make it appear `k` times in a row. We round up the division of `k` by 2 because we need to repeat it twice for each appearance of `t`. If `k` is odd, we still need to repeat `t` once more to make it appear exactly `k` times.\n\nThis solution works for all inputs and has a complexity of O(n).\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input string `t` consists", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * k)\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the input values for n, k, and t. It then prints t repeated k times. This is the minimum possible string of length n that has k occurrences of t as a substring.\n\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * k)\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the input values for n, k, and t.

This is the minimum possible string of length n that has k occurrences of t as a substring.", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * ((k + 1) // 2))\n\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the minimum possible length of the string $s$ by multiplying the string $t$ by the ceiling of $k / 2$ (to handle the case where $k$ is even), and then prints the result.\n\nThis solution works because it ensures that there are exactly $k$ substrings of $s$ equal to $t$ by repeating $t$ enough times to fill $k$ positions in $s$. The length of $s$ is minimized by repeating $t$ as many times as possible, which is achieved by", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nt = input()\nprint(t * (k // (n // t.count(t[0])) + 1))\n\nThis solution works by first reading the input values `n`, `k`, and `t`. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the first character in `t` (`t.count(t[0])`), which is the number of substrings in `t`. It divides `k` by this number to get the number of times `t` needs to be repeated to get `k` substrings.
