Today's fairy tale was about wood cutters and the little girl immediately started imagining the choppers cutting wood. She imagined the situation that is described below.\n\nThere are n trees located along the road at points with coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. Each tree has its height h_{i}. Woodcutters can cut down a tree and fell it to the left or to the right. After that it occupies one of the segments [x_{i} - h_{i}, x_{i}] or [x_{i};x_{i} + h_{i}]. The tree that is not cut down occupies a single point with coordinate x_{i}. Woodcutters can fell a tree if the segment to be occupied by the fallen tree doesn't contain any occupied point.
