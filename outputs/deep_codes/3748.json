Then, it transposes the grid and stores it in the variable `T`. The `zip(*S)` function is used to transpose the grid, and `T[::", "H, W = map(int, input().split())\nS = [input() for _ in range(H)]\nprint('YES' if all(S[i] == S[H - i - 1] for i in range(H // 2)) else 'NO')\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the input. It then checks if the rows are symmetric, which is equivalent to checking if the rows from the top and the bottom are mirror images of each other. This is done using a list comprehension that checks this for each row.
