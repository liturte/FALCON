It then divides the first number by the second and converts the result to a string. The first character of the string (which is the decimal point) is removed and the rest of the string is printed as the output. This will give the exact decimal representation of the quotient.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input will always be in the correct format and that the numbers will not be larger than 10^10^6", "N, M = map(int, input().split())\nprint(N / M)\n\n\nThis solution works by accepting two integers as input, and then simply dividing the first number by the second.

It does not handle possible floating point errors.\n\nIn Python, division of two integers results in a float, so the result is already a decimal", "N, M = map(int, input().split())\nprint(str(N/M)[1:])\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in division operation to compute the quotient. The result is then converted to a string using the str() function. The first character of the string (which is always the '0' in the decimal representation of a quotient) is removed using slicing (str[1:]). The resulting string is then printed.\n\nPlease note that this solution may not work as expected for very large inputs due to Python's handling of large numbers and floating point precision"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nDividing two numbers and computing the decimals is an extremely difficult task.
