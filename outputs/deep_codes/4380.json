It then checks if the product of A and B is odd by checking if the remainder of the division of the product by 2 is 1. If the remainder is 1, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yes\" if A * B % 2 == 1 else \"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads two integers A and B from the input, then calculates the product of A and B. It then checks if this product is odd (i.e., if the remainder when the product is divided by 2 is 1). If the product is odd, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThe \"if A * B % 2 == 1\" part is equivalent to \"if A * B is odd\". The \"else\" part is executed if the condition is not met.\n\nThe \"map\" function is used to read two integers from the input at once. The \"input().split()\" function splits the input by spaces, and \"map\" applies the int function to each resulting string, converting them to integers. The result is a list of two integers, which is then unpacked into A and B.\n\nThe \"print\" function is used to output the result.\n\nNote: The \"%\" operator is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of the division. For example, \"5 % 2\" would be 1, because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the input is", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A * B % 2 == 1:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code works by taking in the input and splitting it into two variables A and B. It then checks if the product of A and B is odd by using the modulus operator (%). If the product is odd, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nNote: The modulus operator gives the remainder of the division of the two numbers. If a number is odd, its remainder when divided by 2 will be 1. If a number is even, its remainder when divided by 2 will be 0.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be in the correct format as described in the problem statement. If this is not the case, you may need to add error checking code to handle incorrect inputs.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A*B % 2 == 1:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code works by taking in two integers A and B from the user.
