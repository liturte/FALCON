We distribute the AtCoder Crackers evenly among the users. The remainder of the division of the number of crackers by the number of users is the number of crackers that each user receives. The minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is the minimum value of these remainders. If the number of users is greater than or equal to the number of crackers, the minimum difference is the number of crackers minus one. If the number of users is 1, the minimum difference is the number of crackers minus one.\n\nThe function min_difference() calculates the minimum difference. It takes as input the number of crackers N and the number of users K. It returns the minimum possible (absolute) difference", "def min_difference(N, K):\n    return (N - K) % K\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_difference(N, K))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe minimum possible difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user is achieved when the number of users (K) evenly divide the total number of crackers (N). \n\nThe remainder of the division operation is the minimum possible difference. If the division is not evenly possible, the remainder will be the difference.\n\nIn this solution, we first define a function `min_difference` that takes two arguments `N` and `K`, and returns the remainder of the division operation `(N - K) % K`. This remainder is the minimum possible difference.\n\nWe then take the input from the user, split it into two integers `N` and `K`, and print the result of the function `min_difference`.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works for all valid inputs.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is valid and does not handle any possible exceptions or errors.\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only", "import sys\n\ndef min_diff(n, k):\n    return n % k\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nprint(min_diff(n, k))\n\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the minimum difference using the modulo operation, and then prints the result.

This is because the remainder is the leftover crackers that cannot be evenly distributed among the users. Therefore, this remainder is the minimum possible difference.\n\nIn the given problem, we are asked to find the remainder of N divided by K. The remainder is then printed as the minimum possible difference.\n\nThe function `min_difference(N, K)` takes two arguments N and K, calculates the remainder of N divided by K and returns it. The input is read from the standard input using the `input().split()` function, which splits the input into two parts separated by a space. These parts are then converted to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function and assigned to N and K respectively. Finally, the result of the `min_difference(N, K)` function is", "def min_difference(N, K):\n    return N % K\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_difference(N, K))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution works by taking the remainder of the division of N by K. This remainder will be the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum number of crackers received by a user. This is because we can distribute the crackers in such a way that each user receives a multiple of K crackers, and the remainder of the division of N by K is the smallest possible difference between these multiples.\n\nFor example, if N=7 and K=3, the remainder of 7 divided by 3 is 1. This means that the largest possible number of crackers received by a user is 3 (because 3*3=9 is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 7), and the smallest possible number of crackers received by a user is 1 (because 1*3=3 is the smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than or equal to 1). The difference between these two values is 1, which is the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received by a"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi has decided to distribute N AtCoder Crackers to K users of as evenly as possible.\nWhen all the crackers are distributed, find the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N,K \\leq 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n7 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nWhen the users receive two, two and three crackers, respectively, the (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user, is 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
