Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:  if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;  if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit). \n\nYou are given an integer number $n$. Tanya will subtract one from it $k$ times. Your task is to print the result after all $k$ subtractions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integer numbers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le k \\le 50$) \u2014 the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer number \u2014 the result of the decreasing $n$ by one $k$ times.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n512 4\n\nOutput\n50\n\nInput\n1000000000 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example corresponds to the following sequence: $512 \\rightarrow 511 \\rightarrow 510 \\rightarrow 51 \\rightarrow 50$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
