Also, there is no friendship or blockship between User 2 and 4. Thus, User 4 is a friend candidate for User 2.\nHowever, neither User 1 or 3 is a friend candidate for User 2, so User 2 has one friend candidate.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
