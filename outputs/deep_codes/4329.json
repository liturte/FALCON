{"4329": {"code": ["S = input()\nT = input()\n\nif T == S + T[-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code works by taking in the two input strings S and T. It then checks if the last character of T is the same as the last character of S when appended to S. If it is, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis is because according to the problem statement, T must be obtained by appending one character at the end of S. The last character of T must be the same as the last character of S. If it is, T satisfies the property and the code prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, T does not satisfy the property and the code prints 'No'.", "S = input()\nT = input()\nif T == S + T[-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThe code takes two inputs S and T. It checks if the last character of T is the same as the last character of S when they are concatenated. If they are the same, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the problem statement is correct and the inputs will always follow the constraints. It doesn't handle any potential errors or invalid inputs.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string T. This is because it iterates through the string T once. The space complexity is O(n), because it creates new strings S and T to hold the inputs.\n\nPlease note that this solution is written in Python. If you want a different programming language, you can use the appropriate syntax.", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint('Yes' if T == S + T[-1] else 'No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads two strings S and T from the standard input. It then checks if the last character of T is the same as the last character of S. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\"\"\"\n\nS = input()\nT = input()\nprint('Yes' if T == S + T[-1] else 'No')\n\n\nThe `[-1]` index is used to get the last character of a string in Python. The `==` operator is used to compare two strings. If they are the same, the condition `T == S + T[-1]` is true, and 'Yes' is printed. If they are not the same, the condition is false, and 'No' is printed.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input strings are valid and do not contain any other characters than lowercase English letters. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added to handle invalid input.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input strings", "S = input()\nT = input()\n\nif T == S + T[-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis Python program will take two strings as input, S and T. It will then check if the last character of T is the same as the first character of S. If it is, it will print 'Yes'. If not, it will print 'No'. This will determine if T can be obtained by appending a character to S.", "S = input()\nT = input()\nif T == S + T[-1]:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads two strings S and T from the input. It then checks if the last character of T is the same as the last character of S. If it is, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\". This is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis solution works because the problem statement specifies that T is obtained by appending one character at the end of S. Therefore, the last character of T must be the same as the last character of S.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem, as it only involves a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input strings.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\nS = input()\nT = input()\n\nif T[-1] == S[-1]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution works by comparing the last"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi wants to be a member of some web service.\nHe tried to register himself with the ID S, which turned out to be already used by another user.\nThus, he decides to register using a string obtained by appending one character at the end of S as his ID.\nHe is now trying to register with the ID T.
