{"1886": {"code": ["word = input()\nprint(word.capitalize())\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `capitalize` function, which converts the first character of a string to uppercase and makes all other characters lowercase.\n\nPlease note that this function does not work as expected with words that start with a number or a special character. For such cases, you would need a more sophisticated solution.\n\nAlso, it does not handle words that start with an uppercase letter. If you need to handle such cases as well, you would need to add a check for that.\n\nHere's an example of how to handle such cases:\n\n\nword = input()\nif word[0].islower():\n    print(word.capitalize())\nelse:\n    print(word)\n\n\nIn this version of the code, we first check if the first character of the word is lowercase. If it is, we capitalize it. If it's not, we leave it as it is.\n\nPlease note that this code will still not work correctly for words that start with a number or a special character. It's a more complex problem that would require a more sophisticated solution.", "word = input().capitalize()\nprint(word)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn Python, the built-in `capitalize()` function can be used to convert the first character of a string to uppercase and make all other characters lowercase.\n\nThe code reads a word from the standard input, capitalizes it using the `capitalize()` function, and then prints the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a single word without any spaces or punctuation. If the input can have spaces or punctuation, the `capitalize()` function will only capitalize the first character of the first word. In such cases, you would need to split the input into words and capitalize each one separately.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input word. The space complexity is also O(n) because the input word is stored in memory.\n\nPlease note that this solution is case sensitive. If the input word is in uppercase, the output will be the same as the input.", "word = input()\nprint(word.capitalize())\n\n\nThis code takes a word as input, capitalizes the first letter and leaves the rest of the word as it is.

The input string is read from the standard input using the `input()` function, and the resulting string is printed to the standard output using the `print()` function.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a valid string of English letters. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be needed.\n\nNote that this solution uses Python's built-in string methods, which are designed to be efficient and easy to use.", "print(input().capitalize())\n\n\nThis code takes an input string and applies the `capitalize` method to it. The `capitalize` method in Python converts the first character to uppercase and makes all other characters in the string lowercase.\n\nThis solution is a direct application of Python's built-in string methods. It's important to note that Python's built-syntax is case sensitive.\n\nFor instance, if the input string is 'konjac', the output will be 'Konjac'. If the input string is 'ApPLe', the output will be 'ApPLe'.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\nTherefore, this solution is efficient and suitable for handling large inputs.\n\nIf the input is 'ApPLe', the output will be 'ApPLe'.
