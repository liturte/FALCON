If the length of the set is 2 (i.e., S consists of exactly two kinds of characters), then it checks if all characters in S appear exactly twice using the all() function and the count() method.

It counts the occurrence of each character in S and stores the counts in a dictionary. The counts are then converted to a list. The list is converted to a set to remove duplicates. If the length of the set is 2 and 4 and 2 are in the set, it means that exactly two kinds of characters appear twice in S. In this case, the code prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nFor example, if S = \"ASSA\", the code will print 'Yes' because A appears twice and S also appears twice.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input is a valid 4-character string consisting of uppercase English letters.\n\"\"\"", "S = input()\nif len(set(S)) == 2 and all(S.count(c) == 2 for c in set(S)):\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis program first reads the input string S. It then checks if the set of characters in S has exactly two elements. If it does, it proceeds to check if each character in the set appears exactly twice in S. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string S is always exactly four characters long. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the characters in S are unique. If there can be duplicate characters in S, additional error checking should be added to handle this situation.\n\nThis solution is written in Python.\n\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nABAB\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nNo\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The set function is used to get all unique characters in the string. If the length of the set is not 2, then the string does not contain exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice.\n\n2. The all function is used to check if all characters in the set appear exactly twice in the string. If not, the string does not contain exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice.\n\n3. If both conditions are met, the string contains exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice, so 'Yes' is printed.
