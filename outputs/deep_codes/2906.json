They wanted to celebrate it with a game of paintball. After an hour of playing a very strange thing happened \u2013 everyone had exactly one bullet left. Marek, being a very curious person, wanted to know whether it\u2019s possible that everyone will be hit exactly once provided nobody moves.\n\n-----Task-----\nYou are given a description of the situation during a paintball game when every player has only one bullet. The description of the game consists of pairs of players who can see each other. If a player can see another player, he can fire at him. Your task is to find a target for each player such that everyone will be hit.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space separated integers $N$ and $M$, satisfying $2\\leq N\\leq 1000$ and $0\\leq M\\leq 5000$, where $N$ is the number of players. Players are numbered $1, 2, \\ldots , N$. $M$ lines follow, each line containing two space separated integers $A$ and $B$ ($1\\leq A < B\\leq N$), denoting that players $A$ and $B$ can see each other. Each pair of players appears at most once in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is no assignment of targets such that everyone will be hit, output Impossible. Otherwise output $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain the number of the target of the $i$-th player. If there is more than one solution, output any one.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\nSample Output:\n2\n3\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
