Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan goes as follows (as told by Hardy):  I remember once going to see him (Ramanujan) when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxicab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. \u201cNo\u201d, he replied, \u201cit is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two different ways.\u201d \n\nIt is from this story the taxicab numbers got their name. The $n$\u2019th taxicab numbers is defined to be the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of two positive cube numbers in $n$ distinct ways.\n\nIt turns out that these numbers grows rather quickly. This makes them very hard to compute, which is not very fun. A variation of the concept is to consider what we will call the bus numbers \u2013 all the numbers which can expressed as the sum of two positive cube numbers in at least $2$ distinct ways. Note that according to this definition, all taxicab numbers (except the first) are also bus numbers.\n\nYour task is to write a program that generates bus numbers; in particular, the largest bus number that is at most equal to some limit $m$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with an integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 400000$), the upper bound of the bus number.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the largest bus number $x$ which does not exceed $m$. If there is no such number, output none.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1730\nSample Output:\n1729\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
