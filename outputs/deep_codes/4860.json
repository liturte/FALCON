It\u2019s fun to see them learning to count, recognize letters, draw, and interact with the world.\n\nOne common problem you\u2019ve noticed is that children often forget numbers when counting. For example, early on they might count \u201cone, two, three, five, six.\u201d You have to remind them about that \u201cfour\u201d that they didn\u2019t say. And as they get more proficient and clever, they may use the \u201cquick\u201d way of counting: \u201cone, two, skip a few, ninety-nine, one hundred!\u201d\n\nPlease write a program that can help you (and your students) identify the missing numbers when they are counting.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$, where $1 \\le n \\le 100$. Each of the next $n$ lines contains one number that the child recited. Each recited number is an integer between $1$ and $200$ (inclusive). They are listed in increasing order, and there are no duplicates.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the child recited all the numbers between $1$ and the last number they recited, then print good job.\n\nIf the child missed any numbers between $1$ and the last number they recited, then print those missing numbers in increasing numeric order, one per line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n9\n2\n4\n5\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n13\nSample Output:\n1\n3\n6\n12\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
