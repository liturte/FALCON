It iterates over the range of A and B values, and checks if 3^A + 5^B equals N. If it does, it returns the pair (A, B). If no such pair is found, it returns -1.\n\nThe range of A and B is limited to 50, because 3^50 is larger than 10^18, and 5^50 is also larger than 10^18. This is a reasonable limit to avoid unnecessary computation.\n\nThe input is", "from math import pow\n\ndef find_pair(n):\n    for a in range(1, int(n**(1/3))+1):\n        for b in range(1, int(n**(1/5))+1):\n            if pow(3, a) + pow(5, b) == n:\n                return a, b\n    return -1\n\nprint(find_pair(int(input())))\n\n\nThis solution uses a brute force approach to check all possible pairs of (A, B) where A ranges from 1 to the cube root of N and B ranges from 1 to the fifth root of N. If it finds a pair that satisfies the condition, it returns that pair. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns -1.\n\nIt uses the `math.pow` function to calculate the power of a number.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input N is a positive integer. If N can be zero or negative, you should add checks for these cases before calculating the cube root and fifth root.", "import math\n\ndef find_pair(n):\n    for a in range(1, 60):\n        for b in range(1, 60):\n            if pow(3, a) + pow(5, b) == n:\n                return (a, b)\n    return -1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(find_pair(n))\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating over a range of possible values for A and B, from 1 to 59 (since 3^60 > 10^18 and 5^60 > 10^18 for any integer A and B). For each pair (A, B), it checks if 3^A + 5^B equals N. If it does, it returns the pair. If no pair is found, it returns -1.\n\nPlease note that this solution is not optimal for large inputs, as it has a time complexity of O(N) and it checks all pairs of (A, B). However, for the given constraints (1 <= N <= 10^18), this solution should be sufficient.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the inputs will be in the correct format.
