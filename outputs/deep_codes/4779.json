The expression is calculated by summing the squares of the first `k` elements and multiplying that by the sum of the remaining elements. The maximum of these values is the answer.\n\nThe Python code above does exactly this. It first reads the input and sorts the array. Then it calculates the maximum value of the expression for each `k` and prints the maximum value.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the array.", "n = int(input())\na = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\na.sort()\nprint(max(sum(a[:i]**2 for i in range(n)) * sum(a[i:] for i in range(n)) for i in range(n)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the observation that the larger the absolute value of $a_i$, the larger the contribution to the product of the two sums. \n\nTherefore, we sort the list of numbers `a` in ascending order. Then, for each possible value of `i`, we calculate the product of the two sums and take the maximum of these products. \n\nThe two sums are calculated as the sum of the squares of the first `i` numbers and the sum of the remaining numbers. \n\nFinally, we print the maximum product.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the list of numbers.", "n = int(input())\na = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\na.sort()\nprint(max(sum(a[i]**2 for i in range(k)) * sum(a[k:]) for k in range(n)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find the maximum value of the expression `(a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + a_k^2) * (a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + ... + a_n)`. \n\nThe first part of the expression is the sum of the squares of the `k` smallest numbers, and the second part is the sum of the `n-k` largest numbers. \n\nTo get the maximum value, we want the `k` smallest numbers to be as large as possible and the `n-k` largest numbers to be as large as possible. \n\nSo, we sort the list of numbers and then try all possible `k` values (from 0 to `n`). For each `k`, we calculate the value of the expression and keep track of the maximum value.\n\nFinally, we print the maximum", "n = int(input())\na = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\na.sort()\nprint(max(sum(a[i]**2 for i in range(k)) * sum(a[k:]) for k in range(n)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem asks to maximize the product of two sums. One sum is a sum of squares of some elements, the other sum is a sum of remaining elements. The key observation here is that we should take the biggest elements for the square sum and the smallest ones for the remaining sum. This is because squaring a number increases its value, so we want to maximize the sum of squares. Similarly, the sum of remaining elements will always be smaller than the sum of squares, so we want to maximize the product of these two sums.\n\nTo achieve this, we first sort the array. Then for each possible division of the array into two sums, we calculate the product of the sums and keep track of the maximum product. Finally, we return the maximum product.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the array.", "n = int(input())\na = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]\na.sort()\nprint(max((sum(a[i]**2 for i in range(k)) * sum(a[k:n])) for k in range(n)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved by sorting the input array and then calculating the maximum possible value of the given expression for each possible value of $k$. The maximum of these calculated values is the answer.\n\nThe expression is calculated as follows:\n - The first part of the expression is the sum of the squares of the first $k$ numbers, which is calculated using the sum of squares formula.\n - The second part of the expression is the sum of the last $n-k$ numbers.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is $O(n \\log n)$ due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is $O(n)$ for storing the input array.\n\nThe solution works by sorting the input array in ascending order.
