If this is not the case, you may need to add error checking to handle invalid inputs.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input and output are integers. If this is not the case, you may need to add type conversion to handle non-integer inputs or outputs.\n\nThis solution is based on Python 3.\n'''\n\n# Explanation\nThis problem is a simple arithmetic problem where we have two integers and an operator. We need to evaluate the expression and print the result. \n\nWe can solve this problem using a simple if-else condition. If the operator is '+', we add the two numbers. If the operator is '-', we subtract the second number from the first", "A, op, B = input().split()\nA = int(A)\nB = int(B)\nif op == '+':\n    print(A+B)\nelse:\n    print(A-B)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution takes the input as a string and splits it into three parts: A, op, and B. A and B are converted to integers, and op is used to determine whether to add or subtract. The result is then printed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA = int(A)\nB = int(B)\nif op == '+':\n    print(A+B)\nelse:\n    print(A-B)\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA = int(A)\nB = int(B)\nif op == '+':\n    print(A+B)\nelse:\n    print(A-B)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA = int(A)\nB = int(B)\nif op == '+':\n    print(A+B)\nelse:\n    print(A-B)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA = int(A)\nB = int(B)\nif op == '+':\n    print(A", "A, op, B = input().split()\nA, B = int(A), int(B)\n\nif op == '+':\n    print(A + B)\nelse:\n    print(A - B)\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input, splitting it into A, op, and B. Then it converts A and B into integers. It then checks if op is '+', and if so, it prints the result of A + B. If op is not '+', it prints the result of A - B.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works for all inputs in the constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\nSOLUTION:\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA, B = int(A), int(B)\n\nif op == '+':\n    print(A + B)\nelse:\n    print(A - B)\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "A, op, B = input().split()\nA, B = int(A), int(B)\nprint(A+B if op=='+' else A-B)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code reads the input, splits it into A, op, and B, converts A and B to integers, and then uses an if-else statement to calculate the result based on the operator. If op is '+', it calculates A + B. If op is '-', it calculates A - B.\n\nThis code is written in Python and is suitable for Python 3.\n\nIt should be noted that this code does not include any error checking. If A or B are not integers or if op is not '+' or '-', the code will fail. This is a basic example and does not include any error checking or handling of edge cases.\n'''\n\n# Python program to solve the problem\ndef solve(A, op, B):\n    if op == '+':\n        return A + B\n    else:\n        return A - B\n\nA, op, B = input().split()\nA, B = int(A), int(B)\nprint(solve(A, op, B))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis Python program reads the input, splits it into A, op, and B, converts A and B to integers, and then uses a function to calculate the result based on the operator.
