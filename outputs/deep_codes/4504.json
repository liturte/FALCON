It then counts the number of characters that occur an odd number of times. If all characters occur an even number of times, the length of the string is returned. Otherwise, the length of the string minus the number of odd-count characters plus one is returned. This is because you can always delete an odd-count character and", "S = input()\nn = len(S)\n\ndef is_even(s):\n    return len(s) % 2 == 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if is_even(S[:n-i]):\n        print(n-i)\n        break\n\n\nThis solution works by iteratively checking substrings of S from the end to the start. It uses a helper function is_even to check if a string is even. When it finds a substring that is even, it prints the length of that substring and exits. This is the length of the longest even string that can be obtained by deleting one or more characters from the end of S.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), as in the worst case it needs to check all possible substrings of S. The space complexity is O", "def longest_even_string(S):\n    length = len(S)\n    for i in range(length):\n        if len(set(S[:i]+S[i+1:])) % 2 == 0:\n            return length - 1\n    return length - 2\n\nS = input()\nprint(longest_even_string(S))\n\n\nThis code works by iterating over the string S and checking if the substring S[:i]+S[i+1:] (where i is the current index) is even. If it is, it returns the length of the substring minus one (the deleted character). If no such substring is found, it returns the length of the substring minus two (the two deleted characters).\n\nThe set function is used to remove duplicates from the substring, and the mod", "def longest_even_string(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n // 2):\n        if s[:n - i - 1] == s[n - i - 1:n - i // 2] and (n - i - 1) % 2 == 0:\n            return n - i - 1\n    return n // 2\n\nprint(longest_even_string(input()))\n\n\nThis code works by iterating from the beginning of the string to the middle, checking if the substring before the current position is equal to the substring after the current position (after reversing). If they are equal and the length of the substring before the current position is even, it returns the length of the substring.
