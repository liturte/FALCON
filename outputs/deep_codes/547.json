Thus in the best case the answer is 1. If, at the other hand, he enters it at the last try, he enters another 4 passwords before. He spends 2 seconds to enter first 2 passwords, then he waits 5 seconds as soon as he made 2 wrong tries. Then he spends 2 more seconds to enter 2 wrong passwords, again waits 5 seconds and, finally, enters the correct password spending 1 more second. In summary in the worst case he is able to be authorized in 15 seconds.\n\nConsider the second sample case. There is no way of entering passwords and get the access to the site blocked. As soon as the required password has length of 2, Vanya enters all passwords of length 1 anyway, spending 2 seconds for that. Then, in the best case, he immediately enters the correct password and the answer for the best case is 3, but in the worst case he enters wrong password of length 2 and only then the right one, spending 4 seconds at all.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
