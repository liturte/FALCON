This formula is derived from the fact that each block is surrounded by four streets, and the number of blocks is equal to the number of intersections of these streets.\n\nThe number of intersections of n streets running east-west and m streets running north-south is (n-1)*(m-1), as each intersection is formed by crossing two streets.\n\nThe Python code reads the input values n and m, and prints the result of the calculation (n-1)*(m-1).\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be valid according to the constraints (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100). If the input is not within these constraints, the code may not behave as expected.\n\nAlso, the code doesn't handle any potential errors that may occur when reading the input. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add error handling code to handle such cases.", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(n * m)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe total number of blocks in K-city is the product of the number of streets running east-west and the number of streets running north-south. This is because each block is surrounded by four streets (two running east-west and two running north-south).\n\nThe `map` function is used to read the input and convert it into integers. The `split` function is used to split the input on spaces, and the `input().split()` function is used to read the input. The `print` function is used to print the result.\n\nThe result is the product of `n` and `m`, which is calculated using the `*` operator.\n\nThe code does not need any comments as it is self-explanatory.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(n * m)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe total number of blocks in K-city is the product of the number of streets running east-west and the number of streets running north-south.

This gives the total number of blocks in the city.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input, which is split into two integers n and m. These are then multiplied together to get the total number of blocks, which is then printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be two integers separated by a space.\n\"\"\"\n\n# The solution provided is a Python code snippet that takes two integers as input from the user (n and m), calculates the total number of blocks in the city (by multiplying the number of east-west streets by the number of north-south streets), and then prints this number to the standard output.\n\n# The problem statement is clear and the solution is straightforward: the number of blocks in the city is the product of the number of east-west and north-south streets.\n\n# The constraints on the input (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) are also handled by the solution, as the product of two integers in this range will always result in a valid number of blocks.\n\n# The solution does not include any comments or explanations, as the problem statement specifies that only the code should", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nblocks = n * m\nprint(blocks)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of blocks in K-city is the product of the number of streets running east-west and the number of streets running north-south. This is because each block is surrounded by four streets, and the number of blocks is equal to the area of the city.\n\nIn the given problem, we are asked to print the number of blocks in K-city. Therefore, we take the input n and m (the number of streets running east-west and the number of streets running north-south respectively), calculate the product of n and m (which gives us the total number of blocks), and print the result.\n\nFor example, if n=3 and m=4, the product is 12 (3*4).
