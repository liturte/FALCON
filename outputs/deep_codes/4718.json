{"4718": {"code": ["S = input()\nprint(\"2018\" + S[4:])\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads the input string `S` and then prints a new string where the first four characters are replaced by \"2018\". This is done by indexing the string `S` with `[4:]`, which starts from the fifth character and goes to the end of the string.\n\nThis code does not include any error checking or verification steps, so it assumes that the input will always be a string of the correct format.\n\nThis code is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test case\nprint(Solution(\"2017/01/07\")) # Expected output: 2018/01/07\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"", "S = input()\nprint('2018' + S[4:])\n\n\njava\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String S = scanner.next();\n        System.out.println(\"2018\" + S.substring(4));\n    }\n}\n\n\njavascript\nconst S = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');\nconsole.log('2018' + S.slice(4));\n\n\ncsharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        string S = Console.ReadLine();\n        Console.WriteLine(\"2018\" + S.Substring(4));\n    }\n}", "s = input()\ns = '2018' + s[4:]\nprint(s)\n\n\nThis program reads the input string `s`, then uses string slicing to replace the first four characters with '2018', and finally prints the result.\n\nIt's important to note that Python string indices start at 0, so `s[4:]` gets the substring starting from the 5th character.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string always follows the given format, as specified in the problem constraints. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be implemented.\n\nAlso, the input and output formats are specific to the problem, so any changes to the input or output format would require adjustments to the solution as well.\n\nThis solution is written in Python.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This solution assumes that the input is always in the expected format. If the input format may vary,", "S = input()\nprint('2018' + S[4:])\n\n\nThis code takes the input string `S`, then uses string slicing to select the substring starting from the 5th character (Python uses 0-based indexing). The `print` statement then concatenates the string '2018' with this substring.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string will always start with '2017/01/' and end with a two-digit number. It will not handle other cases correctly.\n\nTo handle other cases, you could modify the solution to parse the date from `S` and then format it back out as '2018/mm/dd'. Here is an example of how you might do this using the `datetime` module:\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nS = input()\ndate = datetime.strptime(S, '2", "S = input()\nS = \"2018\" + S[4:]\nprint(S)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code first reads the input string `S`. It then constructs a new string by concatenating the string \"2018\" and the substring of `S` starting from the 5th character (`S[4:]`). Finally, it prints the resulting string.\n\nThe line `S = \"2018\" + S[4:]` replaces the first four characters of `S` with \"2018\". The `[4:]` slice operation creates a substring of `S` starting from the 5th character. The `print(S)` statement then prints this modified string.\n\nThe solution assumes that the input string `S` always starts with the year \"2017\", followed by a slash, two more digits representing the month"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nOn some day in January 2018, Takaki is writing a document. The document has a column where the current date is written in yyyy/mm/dd format. For example, January 23, 2018 should be written as 2018/01/23.\nAfter finishing the document, she noticed that she had mistakenly wrote 2017 at the beginning of the date column. Write a program that, when the string that Takaki wrote in the date column, S, is given as input, modifies the first four characters in S to 2018 and prints it.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is a string of length 10.\n - The first eight characters in S are 2017/01/.\n - The last two characters in S are digits and represent an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nReplace the first four characters in S with 2018 and print it.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2017/01/07\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2018/01/07\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
