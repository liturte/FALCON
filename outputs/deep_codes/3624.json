Of course they will use the trails marked by the Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT), like any sane trekkers would; such trails all start and end at some cabin where it is possible to lay over. Mr. Day for one likes sleeping comfortably, so he immediately suggested that they sleep in a cabin every night.\n\nHowever, Dr. Knight was of a different opinion; she argued that they\u2019d arrive at their destination much quicker if they went for as long as possible each day, and then slept in tents in between two cabins if need be. Even though Mr. Day agreed that reaching the destination as quickly as possible was desirable, he was not willing to sacrifice the comfort of a proper bed.\n\nAfter a fierce argument, Mr. Day and Dr. Knight decided to split up, each to follow their own strategy.
