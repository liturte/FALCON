Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: \n\n  The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0).  The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0).  The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero.  Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. \n\nHelp Vitaly. Divide the given array.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (|a_{i}| \u2264 10^3) \u2014 the array elements.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print integer n_1 (n_1 > 0) \u2014 the number of elements in the first set. Then print n_1 numbers \u2014 the elements that got to the first set.\n\nIn the next line print integer n_2 (n_2 > 0) \u2014 the number of elements in the second set. Then print n_2 numbers \u2014 the elements that got to the second set.\n\nIn the next line print integer n_3 (n_3 > 0) \u2014 the number of elements in the third set. Then print n_3 numbers \u2014 the elements that got to the third set.\n\nThe printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n-1 2 0\n\nOutput\n1 -1\n1 2\n1 0\n\nInput\n4\n-1 -2 -3 0\n\nOutput\n1 -1\n2 -3 -2\n1 0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
