Before she can fully enjoy the festival she needs to complete the homework assigned by her teacher. Since Rashmi is smart , she has solved all the problems but is struck at one tricky pattern question.\nYour Task is to help Rashmi solve the problem so that she can enjoy the festival with her family.\nThe Problem she is struck on is defined like this:\nGiven an integer N you need to generate the pattern according to following example:\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\n3  \nOutput:\n\n1 4 10\n\n2 5 11\n\n4 10 22\n\n3 6 12  \n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe next line of each contains T space separated integers N.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each N print the required pattern.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 30$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n3 5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1 4 10\n\n2 5 11\n\n4 10 22\n\n3 6 12\n\n1 4 10 22 46\n\n2 5 11 23 47\n\n4 10 22 46 94\n\n3 6 12 24 48  \n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n\n4  \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1 4 10 22\n\n2 5 11 23\n\n4 10 22 46\n\n3 6 12 24\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
