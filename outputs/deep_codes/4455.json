The second programmer can not be mentor of any other programmer, because his skill is minimal among others. The third programmer can be a mentor of the second programmer. The fourth programmer can be a mentor of the first and of the second programmers. He can not be a mentor of the third programmer, because they are in a quarrel.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
