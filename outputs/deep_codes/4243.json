He gains 1000 happiness points for each 500-yen coin he has and gains 5 happiness points for each 5-yen coin he has. (Yen is the currency of Japan.)\nTakahashi has X yen. If he exchanges his money so that he will gain the most happiness points, how many happiness points will he earn?\n(We assume that there are six kinds of coins available: 500-yen, 100-yen, 50-yen, 10-yen, 5-yen, and 1-yen coins.)\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 0 \\leq X \\leq 10^9\n - X is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nX\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum number of happiness points that can be earned.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1024\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2020\n\nBy exchanging his money so that he gets two 500-yen coins and four 5-yen coins, he gains 2020 happiness points, which is the maximum number of happiness points that can be earned.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
