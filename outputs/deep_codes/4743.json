There are several rules for converting words, from any language, to nimionese.\n\nFor any word:\n - All nimion words start with \u2018hard\u2019 consonants (b, c, d, g, k, n, p, t) so you must replace each first letter with the nearest one (choose the option nearest to \u2018A\u2019 if there is a tie).\n - \u201cEach\u201d becomes \u201cDach\u201d.\n - Any hard consonant in subsequent syllables after the first one is remarkably better if it is replaced with the same consonant as the one at the start of the word.\n - \u201cHip-po\u201d becomes \u201cGip-go\u201d.\n - No word ends in a hard consonant. You must add an \u2018ah\u2019, \u2018oh\u2019 or \u2018uh\u2019 at the end, whichever is nearest, rounding toward \u2018A\u2019 in the case of a tie, to the last hard consonant in the word.\n - \u201cDog\u201d becomes \u201cDogah\u201d\n - \u201cHip\u201d becomes \u201cGipoh\u201d.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe only line of input contains a sentence of between $1$ and $50$ words and up to $10^4$ symbols, including single whitespace characters (\u2018\u00a0\u2019) between words and the dashes (\u2018-\u2019) between each syllable.\n\nApart from dashes, the sentence will contain solely lower-and-upper-case Latin letters\u2014and only the first letters of words can be upper-case.\n\n-----Output-----\nWrite to standard output the same sentence from the input, translated to nimionese. Remove any dashes before printing.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the output will fit within $5 \\cdot 10^4$ characters.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nI love ba-na-na\nSample Output 1:\nGah kove bababa\n\nSample Input 2:\nCat-a-pil-lar\nSample Output 2:\nCatacillar\n\nSample Input 3:\nCo-ding is the best\nSample Output 3:\nCociccah gs the bestuh\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
