If AtCoDeer is honest (a=='H'), and he says that TopCoDeer is honest (b=='H'), then TopCoDeer is honest. If AtCoDeer is dishonest (a=='D') and he says that TopCoDeer is honest (b=='H'), then TopCoDeer is dishonest. If AtCoDeer is honest and he says that TopCoDeer is dishonest (b=='D'), then TopCoDeer is honest. If AtCoDeer is dishonest and", "a, b = input().split()\nif a == 'H':\n    print('H')\nelse:\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('D')\n    else:\n        print('H')\n\n\nExplanation:\nIf AtCoDeer is honest (a == 'H'), then TopCoDeer must also be honest (since he is telling the truth).\nIf AtCoDeer is dishonest (a == 'D'), then we need to check whether AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is honest (b == 'H') or dishonest (b == 'D').\nIf AtCoDeer is telling the truth (b == 'H'), then TopCoDeer must be dishonest. If AtCoDeer is lying (b == 'D'), then TopCoDeer must be honest.\n\nSo, the code prints 'H' if AtCoDeer is honest and", "a, b = input().split()\nif a == 'H':\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('H')\n    else:\n        print('D')\nelse:\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('D')\n    else:\n        print('H')\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\na, b = input().split()\nif a == 'H':\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('H')\n    else:\n        print('D')\nelse:\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('D')\n    else:\n        print('H')\n\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a Python program that reads two characters from standard input, a and b. It then determines whether TopCoDeer is honest based on the information given by AtCoDeer. If AtCoDeer is honest and says that TopCoDeer is honest, or if", "a, b = input().split()\nif a == 'H':\n    print(b)\nelse:\n    print('H' if b == 'H' else 'D')\n\n\nThe code reads the input from the user. If AtCoDeer is honest (a=='H'), it prints the statement that TopCoDeer is saying. If AtCoDeer is dishonest (a=='D'), it prints the opposite of what TopCoDeer is saying.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., a and b are either 'H' or 'D'. If this is not the case, the code should be modified to handle invalid inputs.\n\nAlso, the code assumes that AtCoDeer's statement about TopCoDeer's honesty is always correct. If this is not the case, the code should be modified to handle inconsistent statements.\n\nFinally, the code", "a, b = input().split()\nif a == 'H':\n    print('H')\nelse:\n    if b == 'H':\n        print('D')\n    else:\n        print('H')\n\n\nExplanation:\nIf AtCoDeer is honest (a == 'H'), he tells the truth and TopCoDeer is honest (b == 'H').\nIf AtCoDeer is dishonest (a == 'D'), he tells the truth (b == 'H') or lies (b == 'D').\nIf AtCoDeer tells the truth, TopCoDeer is honest.\nIf AtCoDeer lies, TopCoDeer is dishonest if AtCoDeer says TopCoDeer is honest and TopCoDeer is dishonest if AtCoDeer says TopCoDeer is dishonest.\n\nThis code reads the input, splits it into two variables a"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTwo deer, AtCoDeer and TopCoDeer, are playing a game called Honest or Dishonest.\nIn this game, an honest player always tells the truth, and an dishonest player always tell lies.\nYou are given two characters a and b as the input. Each of them is either H or D, and carries the following information:\nIf a=H, AtCoDeer is honest; if a=D, AtCoDeer is dishonest.\nIf b=H, AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is honest; if b=D, AtCoDeer is saying that TopCoDeer is dishonest.\nGiven this information, determine whether TopCoDeer is honest.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - a=H or a=D.\n - b=H or b=D.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b\n\n-----Output-----\nIf TopCoDeer is honest, print H. If he is dishonest, print D.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nH H\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nH\n\nIn this input, AtCoDeer is honest.
