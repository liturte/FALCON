You'll have to help him out!\n\nSpaceman Spiff is initially at the top left corner (1,1) of a rectangular N \u00d7 M grid . He needs to reach the bottom right corner (N,M). He can only move down or right. He moves at the speed of 1 cell per second. He has to move every second\u2014that is, he cannot stop and wait at any cell.\n\nThere are K special cells that contain the Death Ray Blasters planted by the Yukbarfs. Each Blaster has a starting time t and a frequency f.  It first fires at time t seconds, followed by another round at time t+f seconds, then at time t+2f seconds \u2026.  When a Blaster fires, it simultaneously emits four pulses, one in each of the four directions: up, down, left and right.  The pulses travel at 1 cell per second.\n\nSuppose a blaster is located at (x,y) with starting time t and frequency f.  At time t seconds, it shoots its first set of pulses. The pulse travelling upwards will be at the cell (x,y-s) at time t+s seconds.  At this time, the pulse travelling left will be at cell (x-s,y), the pulse travelling right will be at cell (x+s,y) and the pulse travelling down will be at cell (x,y+s).  It will fire next at time t+f seconds.  If a pulse crosses an edge of the grid, it disappears. Pulses do not affect each other if they meet. They continue along their original path. At any time, if Spaceman Spiff and a pulse are in the same cell, he dies. That is the only way pulses interact with Spaceman Spiff. Spaceman Spiff can also never be on a cell which has a blaster. Given these, you should find the least time (in seconds) in which Spaceman Spiff can reach his ship safely.  \n\nAs an example consider a 4\u00d74 grid that has only one Blaster, at (3,2), with starting time 1 and frequency 3.
