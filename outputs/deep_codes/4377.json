He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order \u2014 their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$.\n\nYou have to guess three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.\n\nPay attention that some given numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be equal (it is also possible that $a=b=c$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains four positive integers $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ ($2 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint such positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ that four numbers written on a board are values $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ and $a+b+c$ written in some order. Print $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 6 5 4\n\nOutput\n2 1 3\n\nInput\n40 40 40 60\n\nOutput\n20 20 20\n\nInput\n201 101 101 200\n\nOutput\n1 100 100\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
