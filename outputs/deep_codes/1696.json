Those blocks are centers of ignition. Moreover positions of k of these centers are known and one of these stays unknown. All k + 1 positions are distinct.\n\nThe fire goes the following way: during the zero minute of fire only these k + 1 centers of ignition are burning. Every next minute the fire goes to all neighbouring blocks to the one which is burning. You can consider blocks to burn for so long that this time exceeds the time taken in the problem. The neighbouring blocks are those that touch the current block by a side or by a corner.\n\nBerland Fire Deparment wants to estimate the minimal time it takes the fire to lighten up the whole city. Remember that the positions of k blocks (centers of ignition) are known and (k + 1)-th can be positioned in any other block.\n\nHelp Berland Fire Department to estimate the minimal time it takes the fire to lighten up the whole city.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 500).\n\nEach of the next k lines contain two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_{i} \u2264 m) \u2014 coordinates of the i-th center of ignition. It is guaranteed that the locations of all centers of ignition are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal time it takes the fire to lighten up the whole city (in minutes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 7 3\n1 2\n2 1\n5 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n10 5 1\n3 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the last block can have coordinates (4, 4).\n\nIn the second example the last block can have coordinates (8, 3).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
