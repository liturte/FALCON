She will then push it so the disk\u2019s y coordinate continuously decreases, and x coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the line y = 0 or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk. \n\nCompute the y-coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line will contain two integers n and r (1 \u2264 n, r \u2264 1 000), the number of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively.\n\nThe next line will contain n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 1 000)\u00a0\u2014 the x-coordinates of the disks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single line with n numbers. The i-th number denotes the y-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk. The output will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most 10^{ - 6}.\n\nNamely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$ for all coordinates.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6 2\n5 5 6 8 3 12\n\nOutput\n2 6.0 9.87298334621 13.3370849613 12.5187346573 13.3370849613\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe final positions of the disks will look as follows: [Image] \n\nIn particular, note the position of the last disk.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
