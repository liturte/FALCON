We get a profit of $10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $3$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $1$, we must still limit its height to be at most $10$ ($h=10$).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
