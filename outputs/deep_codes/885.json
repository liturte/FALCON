Today, Eric teaches independent set and edge-induced subgraph.\n\nGiven a graph $G=(V,E)$, an independent set is a subset of vertices $V' \\subset V$ such that for every pair $u,v \\in V'$, $(u,v) \\not \\in E$ (i.e. no edge in $E$ connects two vertices from $V'$).\n\nAn edge-induced subgraph consists of a subset of edges $E' \\subset E$ and all the vertices in the original graph that are incident on at least one edge in the subgraph.\n\nGiven $E' \\subset E$, denote $G[E']$ the edge-induced subgraph such that $E'$ is the edge set of the subgraph. Here is an illustration of those definitions: [Image] \n\nIn order to help his students get familiar with those definitions, he leaves the following problem as an exercise:\n\nGiven a tree $G=(V,E)$, calculate the sum of $w(H)$ over all except null edge-induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, where $w(H)$ is the number of independent sets in $H$. Formally, calculate $\\sum \\limits_{\\emptyset \\not= E' \\subset E} w(G[E'])$.\n\nShow Eric that you are smarter than his students by providing the correct answer as quickly as possible. Note that the answer might be large, you should output the answer modulo $998,244,353$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$), representing the number of vertices of the graph $G$.\n\nEach of the following $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u,v \\le n$, $u \\not= v$), describing edges of the given tree.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer, representing the desired value modulo $998,244,353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n1 2\n3 2\n\nOutput\n11\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the second example, all independent sets are listed below. $\\vdots : \\vdots : \\vdots$\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
