He simply couldn\u2019t make it work, so he had a nervous breakdown and can\u2019t even see clearly anymore. Every time he blinks while reading, the letters in a word get mixed up so that the letters from the second half of the word (the shorter half, if the length is an odd number) \u201cjump in\u201d between the letters from the first half in the following way:\n - the last letter \u201cjumps in\u201d between the first and the second letter\n - the penultimate letter \u201cjumps in\u201d between the second and the third letter\n - the $k$-th letter from the end \u201cjumps in\u201d between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-th letter from the beginning\n\nFor example, the word \u201cabcdef\u201d would become \u201cafbecd\u201d after blinking.\n\nIf Marin blinks again, the same thing happens. After two blinks, the word \u201cabcdef\u201d becomes \u201cadfcbe\u201d.\n\nMarin has decided to write a program to help him determine what\u2019s exactly written on the screen. Unfortunately, after a day\u2019s work, he\u2019s simply too tired and he needs your help. You are given $X$, the number of blinks, and the word Marin sees on the screen. Write a program to solve the mystery for Marin and determine what was actually the word before he blinked $X$ times.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $X$ ($1 \\leq X \\leq 1000000000$), the number of times Marin blinked. The second line of input contains the word from the screen, its length being from the interval $[3,1000]$. The word will consist only from small letters of English alphabet.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the original word, before Marin blinked $X$ times.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\nacefdb\nSample Output 1:\nabcdef\n\nSample Input 2:\n1000\naaaaaa\nSample Output 2:\naaaaaa\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
