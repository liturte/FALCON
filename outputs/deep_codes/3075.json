Because gas is so expensive, Tony wants to carefully choose the gas stations he refuels at to save as much money as possible.\n\nFor simplicity, assume Tony is driving on a straight road from left to right. There are $n$ gas stations along the road, where each gas station is uniquely identified by its distance to the right of the origin (Tony\u2019s initial position). The cost per gallon of gas may be different at different gas stations. Finally, one gallon of gas allows Tony\u2019s car to travel one kilometer.\n\nWhen Tony reaches a gas station, he may refuel his car to any amount, as long as the total amount of fuel in his car doesn\u2019t exceed the car\u2019s fuel tank capacity $g$.\n\nAssuming Tony has a full tank initially, what is the minimum cost to travel to the rightmost gas station?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $g$. It is guaranteed that $1\\leq n, g\\leq 200000$.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contains two integers each. The first integer $d_ i$ is the distance of the gas station to the right of the origin (in kilometers). The second integer $c_ i$ is the cost per gallon of gas. It is guaranteed that $1\\leq d_ i\\leq 4\\cdot 10^{10}$, $1\\leq c_ i\\leq 10^9$, and that no two gas stations are located at the same point.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible for Tony to complete his trip without running out of gas, print a single integer $C$, the minimum cost to complete the trip. Otherwise, print \u201ccancel road trip\u201d (without quotes).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 10\n2 100\n1 10\n11 5\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 10\n2 100\n1 10\n13 5\nSample Output 2:\ncancel road trip\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
