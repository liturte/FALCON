An inversion is defined as a pair of elements (p_i, p_j) where i < j and p_i > p_j. The number of inversions is used to determine if the permutation can be sorted by swapping elements.\n\nIn a sorted sequence, each element should be in its correct position. This means that the number of elements that are in the wrong position should be even. Therefore, if the number of inversions is even, it's possible to sort the sequence by swapping elements.

It then iterates over the permutation, checking if each element is greater than the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to sort the permutation in ascending order by swapping elements. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns 'YES' because it is possible to sort the permutation in ascending order by not swapping any elements.\n\nThis solution assumes that the permutation is a valid one, i.e., it contains all the integers from 1 to N exactly once", "N = int(input())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif p == sorted(p):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nThe solution is simple: we first read the input data. Then we check if the permutation p is already sorted. If it is, we print \"YES\". If it isn't, we print \"NO\". We use the sorted function to sort the list p and compare it to the original list p. If they are the same, the list p is sorted.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always a permutation of the numbers 1 through N, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input data is well-formed, i.e., the number N is an integer and the list p contains N integers. The code does not handle any error checking for these conditions.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N log N), because it sorts the list p.

If it is not, it returns 'NO'. If it passes this check for all integers in the list, it returns 'YES'.", "n = int(input())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\np_sorted = sorted(p)\np_reverse_sorted = sorted(p, reverse=True)\n\nif p == p_sorted or p == p_reverse_sorted:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nThis Python code first reads the input and converts it into a list of integers. It then checks if the original list is already sorted in ascending order or in descending order. If either of these conditions is met, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution assumes that a list is considered sorted in ascending order if all adjacent elements are in non-descending order. A list is considered sorted in descending order if all adjacent elements are in non-ascending order.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), which is due to the sorting operations.
