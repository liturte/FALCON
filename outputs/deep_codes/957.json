The find() function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of 'heidi' in the input string. If 'heidi' is not found, find() returns -1.\n\nIn the context of the problem, this solution is correct because it checks if the input string contains 'heidi' as a subsequence, which is the same as checking if 'heidi' is a substring of the input string.\n\nThis solution is also efficient because it uses the built-in find() function, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\n'''\n\nprint('YES' if input().find('heidi') != -1 else 'NO')\n\n'''\n\n'''\n\nThis solution is correct because it checks if the input string contains 'heidi' as a subsequence, which is the same as checking if 'heidi' is a substring of the input string.\n\nThis solution is also", "print('YES' if 'heidi' in input() else 'NO')\n\n\nThe `in` keyword in Python checks if a string exists in another string. In this case, it checks if 'heidi' exists in the input string. If it does, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string is all lowercase and does not contain any punctuation or numbers. If these conditions are not met, the solution may not work correctly.\n\nIf the input string can contain uppercase letters, the solution would need to be modified to convert the input string to lowercase before checking for 'heidi'.\n\n\nprint('YES' if 'heidi' in input().lower() else 'NO')\n\n\nThis solution will work for all cases, but it's not optimal for very long strings because it converts the entire input string to lowercase. If performance is a concern, a different solution would be needed.\n\nThis solution also assumes that 'heidi' is always in the input string. If 'heidi' can be anywhere in the string, the solution would need to be modified to check for 'heidi' at each possible starting position in the string.\n\n\nprint('", "print('YES' if 'heidi' in input() else 'NO')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses Python's in-built function to check if a substring exists in a string. If 'heidi' is in the input string, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a lowercase string composed of letters 'a' to 'z' only. It does not validate the input, so it can fail if the input does not meet this assumption.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.\n\nThis solution is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'Heidi', 'HEIDI', and 'heidi' as different strings. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the input string to lowercase using the lower() function before checking if 'heidi' is in it.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint('YES' if 'heidi' in input().lower() else 'NO')\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "print('YES' if 'heidi' in input() else 'NO')\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `input()` function to read the input string, and the `in` keyword to check if 'heidi' is a subsequence of the input string. The `print` function is used to output 'YES' if 'heidi' is a subsequence, and 'NO' otherwise.\n\nThe `in` keyword in Python checks if a string is a subsequence of another string by checking if the first string is a substring of the second string. In this case, if 'heidi' is in the input string, it means that 'heidi' is a subsequence of the input string, so 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string does not contain uppercase letters or any other characters that are not lowercase letters. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nThe solution also assumes that the input string is composed of lowercase letters only, as specified in the problem statement. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be needed.", "print(\"YES\" if 'heidi' in input() else \"NO\")\n\n\nThis solution is pretty straightforward. It simply checks if the string 'heidi' is in the input string. If it is, it prints \"YES\", otherwise it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis is a case-sensitive solution, so it will not detect 'Heidi', 'HEIDI', or any other variation of the letters. If you want to ignore case, you can modify the solution like this:\n\n\nprint(\"YES\" if 'heidi' in input().lower() else \"NO\")\n\n\nThis will convert the input string to lowercase before checking if it contains 'heidi'.\n\n\nprint(\"YES\" if 'heidi' in input().lower() else \"NO\")\n\n\nThis will convert the input string to lowercase before checking if it contains 'heidi'.\n\n\nprint(\"YES\" if 'heidi' in input().lower() else \"NO\")\n\n\nThis will convert the input string to lowercase before checking if it contains 'heidi'.\n\n\nprint(\"YES\" if 'heidi' in input().lower() else \"NO\")"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAs it's the first of April, Heidi is suspecting that the news she reads today are fake, and she does not want to look silly in front of all the contestants.
