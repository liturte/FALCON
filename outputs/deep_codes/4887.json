The area of a square is given by the formula $a = s^2$ where $s$ is the side length. Since we know the area of the pasture, we can solve for $s$ using the formula $s = \\sqrt{a}$. The length of the fence is then given by the formula $l = 4s = 4\\sqrt{a}$. We can use this formula to calculate the length of the fence needed.\n\nThis solution assumes that the pasture is a square and that the fence is perimeter-based (i.e., the length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of its four sides). If the pasture is not square or if the fence is area-based (i.e., the length of the fence is the sum of the areas of its four sides), then the solution would be different.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the pasture is a perfect square. If the pasture is not a square, then the solution would be different.\n\nThis solution uses the math library to calculate the square root of the area.

We can find the side of the square by taking the square root of the area. \n\nThe perimeter of a square is given by 4 * side. \n\nSo, to find the length of the fence, we take the square root of the area and multiply by 4.\n\nThis solution uses the `math.sqrt` function from the math module to calculate the square root.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input and converted to an integer using the `int` function. The result is then printed to the standard output using the `print` function.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it takes constant time to run regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space.\n\nThis solution should work for all valid inputs within the given constraints (1 <= a <= 10^18).\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\nimport math\n\na = int(input())\nprint(4 * math.sqrt(a))", "import math\n\na = int(input())\nprint(4 * math.sqrt(a))\n\n\nThis code works by first taking the input for the area of the pasture.

Therefore, to find the side_length of the square, we take the square root of the area. Since the pasture is a square, the side_length of the pasture is the same as the length of the fence. The length of the fence is then 4 times the side_length, since the pasture has a side for each of the four sides of the fence.\n\nThis solution assumes that the pasture is perfectly square, as per the problem statement. If the pasture is not square, the side_length calculation will need to be adjusted to account for the shape of the pasture.\n\nThe `math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of the area, and the result is multiplied by 4 to get the total length of the fence. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThe `input` function is used to get the area of the pasture from the user.

Then, it calculates the total length of the fence by multiplying the side length by 4 (since a square has 4 sides).\n\nIt's important to note that the fence length will be a floating-point number. If you want to round it to the nearest meter, you can use the built-in `round()` function in Python.
