For each possible number A_i, it calculates the number of sequences that can be formed by appending A_i to sequences of length i-1. It does this by iterating over all possible previous numbers A_{i-1} and adding the number of sequences that can be formed by appending A_{i-1} to sequences of length i-1. It uses modulo operation to prevent overflow. The final answer is the sum of all possible numbers A_i for i from 1 to N.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N) and the space complexity is O(N).\n\"\"\"\n\n# ----------------------------------------\n#", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\nN = int(input())\n\ndp = [[0]*10 for _ in range(N+1)]\nfor i in range(10):\n    dp[1][i] = 1\n\nfor i in range(2, N+1):\n    dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][7] % MOD\n    dp[i][9] = dp[i-1][8] % MOD\n    for j in range(1, 9):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD\n\nprint(sum(dp[N]) % MOD)\n\n\nThis python code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
