The sum of all the elements was divisible by $3$. \n\nUnfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array $n$ and the numbers $l$ and $r$, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array. \n\nSince the answer could be very large, print it modulo $10^9 + 7$ (i.e. the remainder when dividing by $10^9 + 7$). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print $0$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line contains three integers $n$, $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the remainder when dividing by $10^9 + 7$ the number of ways to restore the array.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3 2 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n9 9 99\n\nOutput\n711426616\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the possible arrays are : $[1,2], [2,1], [3, 3]$.\n\nIn the second example, the only possible array is $[2, 2, 2]$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
