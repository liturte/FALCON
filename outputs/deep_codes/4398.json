It then creates a new string by alternating the characters of S and T using the zip function, which pairs up corresponding characters from S and T. The join function is then used to convert this list of pairs into a single string. Finally, the resulting string is printed to the output.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input format is as described in the problem statement.
