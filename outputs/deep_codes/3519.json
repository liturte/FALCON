On each turn you flip two cards of your choice face up. If they match you remove them from the game, and if they don\u2019t match, you turn them face down. The goal of the game is to remove all cards from the game.\n\nYour strategy is simple:\n - If you know of two face-down cards which have the same picture, choose both of them.\n - Otherwise,\n - Turn a random card that you have not looked at before face up.\n - If it matches a card you have seen, turn the matching card face up (you have excellent memory).\n - If the first card did not match a card you had seen before, turn another random unknown card face up.\n\nGiven this strategy, what is the expected number of turns you have to play in order to finish the game?\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is a single integer $N$ indicating the number of pairs of cards.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the expected number of turns needed to finish the game. This number must have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nSample Output:\n1.000000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
