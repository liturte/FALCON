When this button is pressed, the brightness level is increased by 1, except when the brightness level is m, in which case the brightness level becomes 1.\nThe second button is a \"favorite\" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level becomes the favorite brightness level x, which is set when the lamp is purchased.\nSnuke is thinking of setting the favorite brightness level x so that he can efficiently adjust the brightness.\nHe is planning to change the brightness n-1 times. In the i-th change, the brightness level is changed from a_i to a_{i+1}. The initial brightness level is a_1.\nFind the number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons when x is set to minimize this number.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq a_i\\leq m\n - a_i \\neq a_{i+1}\n - n, m and a_i are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nn m\na_1 a_2 \u2026 a_n\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 6\n1 5 1 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nWhen the favorite brightness level is set to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Snuke needs to press the buttons 8, 9, 7, 5, 6 and 9 times, respectively.\nThus, Snuke should set the favorite brightness level to 4.\nIn this case, the brightness is adjusted as follows:\n - In the first change, press the favorite button once, then press the forward button once.\n - In the second change, press the forward button twice.\n - In the third change, press the favorite button once.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
