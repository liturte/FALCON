The idea is to calculate the prefix sum of the string S modulo 2019, and then count the frequency of each prefix sum. The number of pairs that satisfy the condition is the sum of the frequency of each prefix sum multiplied by the frequency of the prefix sum minus 1 (to exclude the pair (i,i)).\n\nThe code above implements this idea.
