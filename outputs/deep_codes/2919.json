If the stack contains fewer than two elements, print \u201cInvalid subtraction operation\u201d on a line by itself and leave the stack unchanged.\n - [Tab][Space][Space][Newline] \u2014 Remove the two topmost stack elements and push their product onto the stack.

If the stack contains fewer than two elements, print \u201cInvalid division operation\u201d on a line by itself and leave the stack unchanged. If the stack contains two or more elements, the topmost of which is\u00a0$0$, print \u201cDivision by zero\u201d on a line by itself and leave the stack unchanged.\n - [Tab][Newline][Space][Tab] \u2014 Remove the integer on the top of the stack and print it on a line by itself (in the usual base-$10$ representation). If the stack is empty, print \u201cInvalid print operation\u201d on a line by itself.\n\nIn the first instruction above, an integer to be pushed onto the stack is in binary form, encoded as two or more characters from the set $\\{ $[Space], [Tab]$\\} $ followed by a [Newline] character. The first character encodes the sign of the integer ([Space] $=$ positive, [Tab] $=$ negative), and the following [Space] and [Tab] characters encode the bits in the binary representation of the absolute value (magnitude) of the integer, with the convention that [Space] $= 0$, [Tab] $= 1$. The first bit after the sign bit is most significant, and there are no leading zeros. For example, since $13$ in binary is $1101$, the encoding of $-13$ is [Tab][Tab][Tab][Space][Tab][Newline] \n\nNote that there are two encodings of $0$, one for $+0$ and one for $-0$. These are interchangeable. However, in the last instruction above, if the value to be printed is zero, print\u00a0\u201c0\u201d, not\u00a0\u201c-0\u201d.\n\nGiven a Litespace program, produce the program\u2019s output.

The length of the string is at most $10000$. It is guaranteed that the Litespace program produces at least one line of output. Also, any integer pushed onto the stack or generated by a successful arithmetic operation will be less than $2^{31}$ in absolute value.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the output of the Litespace program.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nSSSTTSNTNST\nSample Output:\n6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
