If it is, it adds k to n to find the smallest integer greater than n. If n is not divisible by k, it divides n by k and rounds up to find the smallest integer that is greater than n and divisible by k.

It then starts from n and increments x by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until x is divisible by k. The loop breaks when such an x is found, and it is then printed.\n\nThis is the simplest solution, but it's not the most efficient. If k is a power of 2, the solution could be improved by using bitwise operations. However, for any other k, this solution is correct and efficient.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the difference between x and n. The space complexity is O(1), as no extra space is used.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a valid integer pair and that k is not zero. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nif n % k == 0:\n    print(n + k)\nelse:\n\n    print(n + (k - n % k))\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint((n + k - 1) // k * k)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a simple mathematical problem. The idea is to find the smallest integer x > n, so it is divisible by the number k. This can be done by finding the smallest integer y that is not less than n/k and is divisible by k. \n\nWe can solve this problem by using integer division (//), which rounds down the result to the nearest integer. For example, 5 // 3 = 1, because 1 is the largest integer that is not greater than 5/3.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is (n + k - 1) // k * k. This code first adds k - 1 to n, so the result is not less than n/k. Then it performs integer division by k, and multiplies the result by k. This gives the smallest integer x > n that is divisible by k.\n\nThis code works because the expression (n + k - 1) // k is the smallest integer y that is not less than n/k, and multiplying this result by k gives the smallest integer x > n that is divisible by k.\n\nThis code works for any positive integers n and k, because the expression (n + k - 1) // k is always a positive integer.\n\nThis code is written in Python and is a single line of code. It reads two integers from the input, calculates the smallest integer x > n"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nJohny likes numbers n and k very much.
