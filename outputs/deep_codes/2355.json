At that, the set of edges must meet the condition: both ends of each edge from the set must belong to the chosen set of vertices. \n\nYour task is to find a p-interesting graph consisting of n vertices.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 5) \u2014 the number of tests in the input. Next t lines each contains two space-separated integers: n, p (5 \u2264 n \u2264 24; p \u2265 0; $2 n + p \\leq \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph and the interest value for the appropriate test. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the required graph exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each of the t tests print 2n + p lines containing the description of the edges of a p-interesting graph: the i-th line must contain two space-separated integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n;\u00a0a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}) \u2014 two vertices, connected by an edge in the resulting graph. Consider the graph vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. \n\nPrint the answers to the tests in the order the tests occur in the input. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n6 0\n\nOutput\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n1 6\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
