There are n checkpoints located along the line at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. Vasya starts at the point with coordinate a. His goal is to visit at least n - 1 checkpoint in order to finish the competition. Participant are allowed to visit checkpoints in arbitrary order.\n\nVasya wants to pick such checkpoints and the order of visiting them that the total distance travelled is minimized. He asks you to calculate this minimum possible value.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and a (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000,  - 1 000 000 \u2264 a \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of checkpoints and Vasya's starting position respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} ( - 1 000 000 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of the checkpoints.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum distance Vasya has to travel in order to visit at least n - 1 checkpoint.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 10\n1 7 12\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n2 0\n11 -10\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n5 0\n0 0 1000 0 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Vasya has to visit at least two checkpoints. The optimal way to achieve this is the walk to the third checkpoints (distance is 12 - 10 = 2) and then proceed to the second one (distance is 12 - 7 = 5). The total distance is equal to 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nIn the second sample it's enough to visit only one checkpoint so Vasya should just walk to the point  - 10.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
