The result is then modulo'ed by (10^9 + 7) to prevent overflow and to get the answer in the required range.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(K log N) because it pops the smallest element from the heap in O(log N) time and it does this K times.

The maximum product is achieved when the largest integer is raised to the power of k. Therefore, the code sorts the list and raises the last element (which is the largest) to the power of k, modulo MOD (10^9 + 7). The pow function with three arguments is used to compute the power modulo efficiently.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input integers are all positive or all negative. If there are positive and negative integers in the input, the code will not work correctly because the maximum product could be achieved by multiplying", "import sys\nimport heapq\n\nN, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nA = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nheapq.heapify(A)\n\nans = 1\nfor _ in range(K):\n    a = heapq.heappop(A)\n    ans = (ans * a) % (10**9 + 7)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nThis code first reads the input from the standard input. It then creates a heap from the list of integers and pops out the smallest integer K times. The product of the K popped integers is then computed and printed out modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\nThe heapq module is used to implement the heap data structure, which can be used to find the K largest elements in O(n log k) time. The heap is created in-place, so it does not require extra space.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n log k) and the space complexity is O", "import heapq\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Get the maximum K numbers from the list\nmax_numbers = heapq.nlargest(K, A)\n\n# Calculate the product of the maximum K numbers\nproduct = 1\nfor num in max_numbers:\n    product = (product * num) % (10**9 + 7)\n\nprint(product)\n\n\nThis Python program uses the heapq module to get the maximum K numbers from the list. The nlargest function returns the K largest elements from the list in descending order. The product of these numbers is then calculated modulo (10^9 + 7) to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's constraints.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input numbers are integers. If the numbers can be floating point numbers, the solution would need to be adapted accordingly.\n\nThe solution also assumes that the input numbers are non-zero.
