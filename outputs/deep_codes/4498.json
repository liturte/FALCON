{"4498": {"code": ["a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(a-c) <= d:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a simple comparison of the absolute difference between the coordinates of A and C and the distance d. If the difference is less than or equal to d, A and C can communicate, so we print 'Yes'. Otherwise, we print 'No'.\n\nThis solution works because the two people can communicate if the distance between them is at most d. In this case, the distance between A and C is the absolute difference between their coordinates. If this distance is less than or equal to d, A and C can communicate. Otherwise, they cannot.\n\nThe map function is used to convert the input strings to integers, and the input is read from the standard input using the input function. The print function is used to output the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid according to the problem constraints. If the input could be invalid, you should", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution works by first calculating the absolute difference between the coordinates of A and B, and then between B and C. If both of these values are less than or equal to d, then A and C can communicate. If either of these values is greater than d, then A and C cannot communicate.\n\nThe `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers, and `map` is used to convert the input string into integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input string into a list of substrings, based on spaces. The `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it runs in constant time, regardless of the size of the input. This is because the number of operations it performs does not change with the", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input and splitting it into the four variables a, b, c, and d. It then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d, and if the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d. If both conditions are true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the transceivers are at the coordinates given by a, b, and c. It doesn't take into account any obstacles or other factors that might prevent communication. If that's a possibility, the problem would need to be more complex.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the distances between the transceivers are straight-line distances. If that's not the case (for example, if the transceivers are on a grid),", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(a-b) <= d and abs(b-c) <= d:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code reads the coordinates and the communication range from the input. It then checks if the absolute difference between the coordinates of A and B is less than or equal to the communication range, and if the absolute difference between the coordinates of B and C is less than or equal to the communication range. If both conditions are met, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis code is efficient because it uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference and the `map` function to read the input values.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(1), which means it takes a constant amount of time to run, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input values and the result.", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\nThis solution uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between two points, and checks if this difference is less than or equal to `d`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the coordinates are given in the order A, B, C. If the order is different, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso, it assumes that the transceivers can only communicate if the distance between them is less than or equal to `d`. If the condition for communication can be different, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement. If the input format can be different, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution does not handle any potential"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThree people, A, B and C, are trying to communicate using transceivers.\nThey are standing along a number line, and the coordinates of A, B and C are a, b and c (in meters), respectively.\nTwo people can directly communicate when the distance between them is at most d meters.\nDetermine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly.\nHere, A and C can indirectly communicate when A and B can directly communicate and also B and C can directly communicate.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 a,b,c \u2264 100\n - 1 \u2264 d \u2264 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b c d\n\n-----Output-----\nIf A and C can communicate, print Yes; if they cannot, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 7 9 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nA and B can directly communicate, and also B and C can directly communicate, so we should print Yes.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
