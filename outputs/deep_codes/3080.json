A ski lift can take a guest to the top of the mountain. From there they can ski to a number of locations throughout the mountain.\n\nThere are $n$ areas on the mountain. The areas are labeled $1$ to $n$. The top of the mountain is area $1$. Areas are connected with ski runs that are strictly downhill. In other words, it is not possible to return to an area after leaving it without taking the ski lift. Every area (including area $1$) has exactly one snack stand.\n\nAs the owner of the resort, you want to know how effectively you can distribute snacks among snack stands to better serve your guests (and make more money). To this end you would like to run a survey, and analyze the result with a number of independent queries. Each guest in the survey has a favorite snack, and a list of favorite areas that they like to visit. You would like to know how to best stock your snack stands with their favorite snack.\n\nEach query is a set of a guest\u2019s favorite areas, and a number $k$. You would like to know how many ways you can distribute this guest\u2019s favorite snack to exactly $k$ snack stands on the mountain such that the snack stands meet a few conditions:\n - For each of this guest\u2019s favorite areas, over all sequences of ski runs to reach that area from the top of the mountain, there must be exactly one snack stand with the guest\u2019s favorite snack (In other words, they must not have a choice of more than one snack stand where their snack is available.)\n - Each of the $k$ snack stands stocked with this guest\u2019s favorite snack must be on some sequence of ski runs from the top of the mountain to some area in the query set.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case.
