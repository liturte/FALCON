Each day he will fight with all opponents who are present this day. His opponents have some fighting plan that guarantees they will win, but implementing this plan requires presence of them all. That means if one day at least one of Arya's opponents is absent at the school, then Arya will beat all present opponents. Otherwise, if all opponents are present, then they will beat Arya.\n\nFor each opponent Arya knows his schedule\u00a0\u2014 whether or not he is going to present on each particular day. Tell him the maximum number of consecutive days that he will beat all present opponents.\n\nNote, that if some day there are no opponents present, Arya still considers he beats all the present opponents.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and d (1 \u2264 n, d \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of opponents and the number of days, respectively.\n\nThe i-th of the following d lines contains a string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The j-th character of this string is '0' if the j-th opponent is going to be absent on the i-th day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of consecutive days that Arya will beat all present opponents.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\n10\n00\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 1\n0100\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 5\n1101\n1111\n0110\n1011\n1111\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first and the second samples, Arya will beat all present opponents each of the d days.\n\nIn the third sample, Arya will beat his opponents on days 1, 3 and 4 and his opponents will beat him on days 2 and 5. Thus, the maximum number of consecutive winning days is 2, which happens on days 3 and 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
