Exactly one bag contains only counterfeit coins (we\u2019ll call this the fake bag), while all other bags contain only real coins. All real coins weigh exactly the same number of grams.

To use the scale, you can place any number of coins, taken from any of the bags, on each side of the scale, as long as the total number of coins on the left and right sides are exactly equal.
