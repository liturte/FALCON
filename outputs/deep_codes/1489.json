For each point you can either draw a vertical line through it, draw a horizontal line through it, or do nothing.\n\nYou consider several coinciding straight lines as a single one. How many distinct pictures you can get? Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points.\n\nn lines follow. The (i + 1)-th of these lines contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} ( - 10^9 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of the i-th point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of possible distinct pictures modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n16\n\nInput\n2\n-1 -1\n0 1\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there are two vertical and two horizontal lines passing through the points. You can get pictures with any subset of these lines. For example, you can get the picture containing all four lines in two ways (each segment represents a line containing it). The first way:   [Image]   The second way:   [Image] \n\nIn the second example you can work with two points independently. The number of pictures is 3^2 = 9.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
