What is it?\u201d, Mirko asked.\n\n\u201cListen carefully! In the backyard I have $N$ pebbles arranged in a circle. Some of the pebbles are black, some are white. I will do the following: between any two neighbouring pebbles of the same colour I will insert a black pebble, and between any two neighbouring pebbles of different colours I will insert a white pebble. At that point there will be $2N$ pebbles in the circle, so I will remove the starting $N$ pebbles so that only the newly added $N$ pebbles remain. And all this I intend to do exactly $K$ times. And then you are to determine my starting circle.\u201d, said Stanko long-windedly.\n\n\u201cHa! I shall not fall prey to your trickery! I can see that it is not necessarily possible to know exactly what the starting circle was, but I can count the number of distinct starting circles that give the same result as your circle after exactly $K$ of those weird transformations of yours\u201d, answered Mirko.\n\nYou are given the configuration of the circle before Stanko performed the transformation described above $K$ times.\n\nWrite a program that determines the number of distinct starting circles that give the same circle after $K$ transformations as Stanko\u2019s original circle does after $K$ transformations.\n\nTwo configurations of pebbles are considered to be the same circle if one can be gotten from the other by rotating it any number of positions. For example BBW and BWB is the same circle whereas BBWWBW and WWBBWB are not.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, $3 \\le N \\le 100$, $1 \\le K \\le 10$, where $N$ is the number of pebbles in the circle and $K$ is the number of transformations made by Stanko. The second line contains exactly $N$ characters \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018W\u2019 representing Stanko\u2019s original circle.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of possible distinct starting circles on a single line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 1\nBBW\nSample Output:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
