Then $d(a_ k$, $a_{k+1}) = 2$ or $3$ for every $1 \\leq k < NM$. Also, $d(a_{NM}, a_1) = 2$ or $3$.\n\nHere, $d(p, q)$ denotes the Manhattan distance between $p$ and $q$. More precisely, if $p$ is the square on row $r_ p$ and column $c_ p$ and $q$ is the square on row $r_ q$ and column $c_ q$, then we write $p = (r_ p, c_ p), q = (r_ q, c_ q)$ and $d(p, q) = |r_ p - r_ q| + |c_ p - c_ q|$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input consists of two integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \\leq N, M \\leq 200$).\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is no such tour, output -1. Otherwise, output $N \\times M$ lines. The $i$th line contains two space-separated integers, denoting the row and column numbers of $a_ i$. If there is more than one such tour, any one will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 3\nSample Output:\n1 1\n2 2\n1 3\n2 1\n1 2\n2 3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
