This time he\u2019s come across pensioners playing the card game Belote. They\u2019ve invited him to help them determine the total number of points in a game.\n\nEach card can be uniquely determined by its number and suit. A set of four cards is called a hand. At the beginning of a game one suit that \u201ctrumps\u201d any other is chosen, and it is called the dominant suit. The number of points in a game is equal to the sum of values of each card from each hand in the game. Mirko has noticed that the pensioners have played $N$ hands and that suit $B$ was the dominant suit.\n\nThe value of each card depends on its number and whether its suit is dominant, and is given in Table\u00a01.\n\nNumber\n\nValue\u00a0\n\nDominant\n\nNot dominant\n\nA\n\n$11$\n\n$11$\n\nK\n\n$4$\n\n$4$\n\nQ\n\n$3$\n\n$3$\n\nJ\n\n$20$\n\n$2$\n\nT\n\n$10$\n\n$10$\n\n9\n\n$14$\n\n$0$\n\n8\n\n$0$\n\n$0$\n\n7\n\n$0$\n\n$0$Table 1: Scores \n\nWrite a programme that will determine and output the number of points in the game.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the number of hands $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100$) and the value of suit $B$ (S, H, D, C) from the task. Each of the following $4N$ lines contains the description of a card (the first character is the number of the $i$-th card (A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7), and the second is the suit (S, H, D, C)).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the number of points from the task.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 S\nTH\n9C\nKS\nQS\nJS\nTD\nAD\nJH\nSample Output:\n60\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
