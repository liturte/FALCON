His mom ordered him to read an article about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the \u201cMoja Tajna\u201d magazine. The article is written in a very small font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner in the closet which will enlarge the article for him.\n\nThe article is a matrix of characters with $R$ rows and $C$ columns. The characters are letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character \u2018.\u2019 (period). Mirko\u2019s scanner supports two parameters, $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$. It substitutes each character it scans with a matrix of $Z_ R$ rows and $Z_ C$ columns, where all entries are equal to the scanned character.\n\nMirko realized his scanner\u2019s software no longer works so he needs your help.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first row contains four integers, $R$, $C$, $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$. $R$ and $C$ are between $1$ and $50$, while $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$ are between $1$ and $5$.\n\nEach of the following $R$ rows contains $C$ characters each, representing the article from \u201cMoja Tajna\u201d.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should be a matrix of characters with $R \\cdot Z_ R$ rows and $C \\cdot Z_ C$ columns, the enlarged article.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3 1 2\n.x.\nx.x\n.x.\nSample Output:\n..xx..\nxx..xx\n..xx..\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
