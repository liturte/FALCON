He knocks it down with the first shot because he haven't knocked any other cans down before. After that he has to shoot the third can. To knock it down he shoots $20 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 21$ times. After that only second can remains. To knock it down Vasya shoots $10 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 21$ times. So the total number of shots is $1 + 21 + 21 = 43$.\n\nIn the second example the order of shooting does not matter because all cans have the same durability.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
