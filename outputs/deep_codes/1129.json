{"1129": {"code": ["n = int(input())\npoints = list(map(int, input().split()))\npoints.sort()\nprint(points[n//2])\n\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the list of points. The median of the list of points is the point that minimizes the sum of distances to all other points. This is because the sum of distances to all other points is minimized if you place the median point at the position that minimizes the sum of distances. The median point is the leftmost point if there are multiple points that minimize the sum of distances.\n\nThis solution works in O(n log n) time because it requires sorting the list of points. The space complexity is O(n) because it requires storing the list of points.\n\nThe solution uses the Python built-in functions `sort()` to sort the list of points and `print()` to output the median point.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input points are distinct. If the input points are not distinct, you would need to count the number of occurrences of each point before choosing the median.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input points are integers. If the input points are not integers, you would need to convert them to integers before sorting and choosing the median.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input points are within the", "n = int(input())\nx = list(map(int, input().split()))\nx.sort()\nprint(x[n//2])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe idea is to sort the list of points and then choose the point in the middle as the optimal point. The reason is that the sum of distances to all points will be minimal if we choose the median of the list of points.\n\nThis solution works because the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences to all other points. The median is the middle value of a data set; it divides the data set into two halves. If the data set is even, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In this problem, we can assume that n is even, so the median is the middle point.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle any potential errors or exceptions.\n\"\"\"\n\nn = int(input())\nx = list(map(int, input().split()))\nx.sort()\nprint(x[n//2])\n\n\nThis solution works by sorting the list of points and then choosing the point in the middle as the optimal point. The reasoning behind this is that", "n = int(input())\npoints = list(map(int, input().split()))\npoints.sort()\nprint(points[n // 2])\n\n\nThis solution works by sorting the list of points. The median of a sorted list of numbers is always the middle value. This is because the median is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of a data set. The average of the middle values of a sorted list is also the middle value. Therefore, the median of a list of points is the point that minimizes the sum of distances to all other points.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the points. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the points.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input points are distinct. If the input points can be the same, the solution should be modified to count the number of occurrences of each point and choose the one with the maximum count.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input points are integers. If the input points can be real numbers, the solution should be modified to handle the case where two points have the same x-coordinate.\n\nThis solution does not handle the case where n is even. If n is even, the solution should be modified to choose the leftmost point if there are two points", "n = int(input())\npoints = list(map(int, input().split()))\npoints.sort()\nprint(points[n//2])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the fact that the point x that minimizes the sum of distances to all other points is the median of the sorted list of points. \n\nThe median of a list is the middle value when the list is sorted. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. \n\nThe median minimizes the sum of absolute differences to all other points, so it is the optimal point. \n\nThe sorting operation is performed in O(n log n) time, and then the median is found in O(1) time, so the total time complexity is O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the list of points.\n\nThe code reads the number of points and the coordinates of the points, sorts the list of points, and then prints the middle point.\n\nThe median of a sorted list of points is always an integer, so the output is always an integer.\n\nThis solution works for all n, since the median of a sorted list of n points is always a valid position on the line.", "n = int(input())\npoints = list(map(int, input().split()))\npoints.sort()\nprint(points[n // 2])\n\nThis solution works by sorting the list of points and then choosing the middle point. The middle point is chosen because it is the point that minimizes the sum of distances to all other points. This is a mathematical property of the median. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting step.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input points are distinct. If there are duplicate points, the solution may not return the leftmost optimal point.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the input points are integers. If the points are not integers, the solution may not work correctly.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement is ambiguous in some aspects. For example, it says that the sum of distances to the given points is minimal, but it doesn't specify whether the sum of distances should be minimized in relation to the sum of distances to all other possible points. The solution provided assumes that the sum of distances to all other points is also minimized.\n\nPlease provide more specific details if the problem statement is different."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given n points on a line with their coordinates x_{i}.
