These numbers mean that Greg needs to do exactly n exercises today. Besides, Greg should repeat the i-th in order exercise a_{i} times.\n\nGreg now only does three types of exercises: \"chest\" exercises, \"biceps\" exercises and \"back\" exercises. Besides, his training is cyclic, that is, the first exercise he does is a \"chest\" one, the second one is \"biceps\", the third one is \"back\", the fourth one is \"chest\", the fifth one is \"biceps\", and so on to the n-th exercise.\n\nNow Greg wonders, which muscle will get the most exercise during his training. We know that the exercise Greg repeats the maximum number of times, trains the corresponding muscle the most. Help Greg, determine which muscle will get the most training.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 20). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 25) \u2014 the number of times Greg repeats the exercises.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint word \"chest\" (without the quotes), if the chest gets the most exercise, \"biceps\" (without the quotes), if the biceps gets the most exercise and print \"back\" (without the quotes) if the back gets the most exercise.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input is such that the answer to the problem is unambiguous.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n2 8\n\nOutput\nbiceps\n\nInput\n3\n5 1 10\n\nOutput\nback\n\nInput\n7\n3 3 2 7 9 6 8\n\nOutput\nchest\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Greg does 2 chest, 8 biceps and zero back exercises, so the biceps gets the most exercises.\n\nIn the second sample Greg does 5 chest, 1 biceps and 10 back exercises, so the back gets the most exercises.\n\nIn the third sample Greg does 18 chest, 12 biceps and 8 back exercises, so the chest gets the most exercise.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
