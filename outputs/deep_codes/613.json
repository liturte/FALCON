He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function P(x) = a_0 + a_1x^1 + ... + a_{n}x^{n}. Numbers a_{i} are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer n is called a degree of a polynomial.\n\nVasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: \"Determine how many polynomials P(x) exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that $P(t) = a$, and $P(P(t)) = b$, where $t, a$ and b are given positive integers\"? \n\nVasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains three integer positive numbers $t, a, b$ no greater than 10^18.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is an infinite number of such polynomials, then print \"inf\" without quotes, otherwise print the reminder of an answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2 3 3\n\nOutput\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
