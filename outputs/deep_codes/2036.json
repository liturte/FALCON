As we know, no employee can beat the boss in the chess game, so Boboniu has never lost in any round.\n\nYou are a new applicant for his company. Boboniu will test you with the following chess question:\n\nConsider a $n\\times m$ grid (rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$). You have a chess piece, and it stands at some cell $(S_x,S_y)$ which is not on the border (i.e. $2 \\le S_x \\le n-1$ and $2 \\le S_y \\le m-1$).\n\nFrom the cell $(x,y)$, you can move your chess piece to $(x,y')$ ($1\\le y'\\le m, y' \\neq y$) or $(x',y)$ ($1\\le x'\\le n, x'\\neq x$). In other words, the chess piece moves as a rook. From the cell, you can move to any cell on the same row or column.\n\nYour goal is to visit each cell exactly once. Can you find a solution?\n\nNote that cells on the path between two adjacent cells in your route are not counted as visited, and it is not required to return to the starting point.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $S_x$ and $S_y$ ($3\\le n,m\\le 100$, $2 \\le S_x \\le n-1$, $2 \\le S_y \\le m-1$) \u2014 the number of rows, the number of columns, and the initial position of your chess piece, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nYou should print $n\\cdot m$ lines.\n\nThe $i$-th line should contain two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq y_i \\leq m$), denoting the $i$-th cell that you visited. You should print exactly $nm$ pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, they should cover all possible pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, such that $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq y_i \\leq m$.\n\nWe can show that under these constraints there always exists a solution.
