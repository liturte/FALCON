You happen to know with certainty that the only previous owner of the car Tommy is interested in was a travelling salescat who drove at least $2000$ km and at most $20000$ km every single month. In addition, by Catland law, each car should be serviced at least every $30000$ km or $12$ months, whichever comes first, but you do not know if this has actually been done or not.\n\nThe service history entries indicate the approximate time the service took place, and the reading of the odometer at that time. The maximum distance the odometer can measure is $99999$ km. Upon reaching $100000$ km traveled, the odometer resets to $0$ km. In addition, the entries do not indicate exact time, only the year and month. In particular, even though you know that the car traveled between $2000$ and $20000$ km every month, you do not know how much of that distance was traveled before the service. For the purpose of the $12$ month rule, it does not matter which day during the month a service took place.

In the former case, assuming the odometer has not been tampered with, you must then determine whether or not the car has been serviced sufficiently often.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le e \\le 500$, the number of entries in the service history.\n\nNext follow $e$ lines that describe the entries in the service history.
