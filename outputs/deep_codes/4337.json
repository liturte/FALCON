If the number of unique colors is 3, it means that the bag contains arare in three colors, so we print \"Three\". Otherwise, if the number of unique colors is 4, it means that the bag contains arare in four colors, so we print \"Four\".\n\nThe Python `collections.Counter", "# Read the number of arare and their colors\nN = int(input())\ncolors = input().split()\n\n# Count the number of unique colors\nunique_colors = len(set(colors))\n\n# Print the result\nif unique_colors == 3:\n    print('Three')\nelse:\n    print('Four')\n\n\nThis solution works by reading the number of arare and their colors from the standard input, then counting the number of unique colors. If there are three unique colors, it prints 'Three', otherwise it prints 'Four'.\n\nNote: The input() function reads a line from the standard input, and the split() method splits that", "N = int(input())\nS = input().split()\ncolors = set(S)\nif len(colors) == 3:\n    print('Three')\nelse:\n    print('Four')\n\n\nThis solution uses a set to keep track of the colors of the arare. Since a set only contains unique elements, the size of the set will be 3 if the arare were in three colors and 4 if they were in four. The solution then prints 'Three' if the size of the set is 3 and 'Four' if it is 4.", "from collections import Counter\n\nN = int(input())\nS = input().split()\n\ncolor_count = Counter(S)\n\nif len(color_count) == 3:\n    print('Three')\nelse:\n    print('Four')\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each color in the bag of arare. If the count is 3, it means the bag contains arare in three colors, so 'Three' is printed. If the count is 4, it means the bag contains arare in four colors, so 'Four' is printed.", "# Read the number of arare and their colors\nN = int(input())\ncolors = input().split()\n\n# Count the unique colors\nunique_colors = set(colors)\n\n# If there are three unique colors, the bag had three colors\nif len(unique_colors) == 3:\n    print(\"Three\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Four\")\n\n\nThis solution reads the number of arare and their colors from standard input, counts the unique colors, and then prints \"Three\" if there are three unique colors and \"Four\" if there are four.\n\nThe input and output format matches the problem statement.

(From here, we call them arare.)\nIt is known that the bag either contains arare in three colors: pink, white and green, or contains arare in four colors: pink, white, green and yellow.\nWe have taken out the arare in the bag one by one, and the color of the i-th arare was S_i, where colors are represented as follows - pink: P, white: W, green: G, yellow: Y.\nIf the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print Three; if the number of colors was four, print Four.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - S_i is P, W, G or Y.\n - There always exist i, j and k such that S_i=P, S_j=W and S_k=G.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nS_1 S_2 ... S_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three, print Three; if the number of colors was four, print Four.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\nG W Y P Y W\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nFour\n\nThe bag contained arare in four colors, so you should print Four.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
