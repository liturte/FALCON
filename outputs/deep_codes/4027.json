It uses the modulo operator to determine whether `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, the difference is zero because you can divide the numbers into two equal sets.

If the total number of elements is odd, the minimum difference is 1. This is because in the worst case scenario, one of the sets will contain an extra element that makes the sum", "def min_difference(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_difference(n))\n\n\nThis code works by checking if the input number is even or odd.
