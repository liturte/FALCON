It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '1', it increments a count. If the character is '0', it adds the count to the result (multiplying the result by 10 to shift the digits to the left), and resets the count to 0. After the loop, it adds the final count to the result. The result is then printed.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the string starts with '1', as specified in the problem statement.

When it encounters a '0', it multiplies the current decoded number by 10 and adds the count to it, then resets the count. The final step is to do the same but without adding the count, since this would be the last group of '1's in the string.\n\nPlease note that the solution assumes that the encoded number does not have leading zeros, which is a valid assumption for this problem", "def decode(s):\n    count = 0\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            result = result*10 + count\n            count = 0\n    return result*10 + count\n\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\nprint(decode(s))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the logic of the encoding process. We iterate over the string and count the number of '1's until we encounter a '0'. At this point, we know the value of the current digit, so we add it to the result (multiplying the result by 10 each time to shift the digits to the left). We then reset the count to 0 and continue until the end of the string. The last digit is added to the result outside the loop, because there is no '0"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nPolycarp has just invented a new binary protocol for data transmission. He is encoding positive integer decimal number to binary string using following algorithm:\n\n  Each digit is represented with number of '1' characters equal to the value of that digit (for 0 it is zero ones).  Digits are written one by one in order corresponding to number and separated by single '0' character. \n\nThough Polycarp learnt how to encode the numbers, he has no idea how to decode them back. Help him calculate the decoded number.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 89) \u2014 length of the string s.\n\nThe second line contains string s \u2014 sequence of '0' and '1' characters, number in its encoded format.
