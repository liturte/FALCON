Choose a subset of the given set of points such that the distance between each pair of points in a subset is an integral power of two. It is necessary to consider each pair of points, not only adjacent. Note that any subset containing one element satisfies the condition above. Among all these subsets, choose a subset with maximum possible size.\n\nIn other words, you have to choose the maximum possible number of points $x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \\dots, x_{i_m}$ such that for each pair $x_{i_j}$, $x_{i_k}$ it is true that $|x_{i_j} - x_{i_k}| = 2^d$ where $d$ is some non-negative integer number (not necessarily the same for each pair of points).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of points.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ ($-10^9 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the coordinates of points.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print $m$ \u2014 the maximum possible number of points in a subset that satisfies the conditions described above.\n\nIn the second line print $m$ integers \u2014 the coordinates of points in the subset you have chosen.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n3 5 4 7 10 12\n\nOutput\n3\n7 3 5\nInput\n5\n-1 2 5 8 11\n\nOutput\n1\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the answer is $[7, 3, 5]$. Note, that $|7-3|=4=2^2$, $|7-5|=2=2^1$ and $|3-5|=2=2^1$. You can't find a subset having more points satisfying the required property.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
