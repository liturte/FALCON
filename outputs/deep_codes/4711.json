We just need to find the minimum sum of two different numbers among a, b and c. That's it. The minimum sum of two different numbers can be obtained by sorting the numbers and taking the sum of the first two numbers.\n\"\"\"\n\na, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(a + b, a + c, b + c))\n\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(1), because it performs a constant number of operations.

It takes the three input prices, a, b, and c, and finds the minimum sum of two of them. This is because the minimum total price of two different bells will be the cheapest combination of two different bells. The `min` function in Python returns the smallest of the input values, and `map` function in Python applies a given function to all items in an input list. Here, it is used to convert the input string to integers.\n\nThe solution assumes that the prices are given in the correct format and that they satisfy the constraints given in the problem statement.\n\nThe solution has a time complexity of O(1", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nbell_prices = sorted([a, b, c])\nprint(bell_prices[0] + bell_prices[0] + bell_prices[1])\n\n\nThis code first takes in the input for the prices of the three bells. It then sorts these prices in ascending order, and adds together the two smallest prices (which are the same because Snuke wants two bells of different prices). This is the minimum total price of two different bells.\n\nThe sorted function returns a new list containing all the elements of the original list in ascending order. The [0] + [0] + [1] indexing operation fetches the first two elements (the smallest two) and the third element ("], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke is buying a bicycle.\nThe bicycle of his choice does not come with a bell, so he has to buy one separately.\nHe has very high awareness of safety, and decides to buy two bells, one for each hand.\nThe store sells three kinds of bells for the price of a, b and c yen (the currency of Japan), respectively.\nFind the minimum total price of two different bells.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq a,b,c \\leq 10000\n - a, b and c are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b c\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum total price of two different bells.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n700 600 780\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1300\n\n - Buying a 700-yen bell and a 600-yen bell costs 1300 yen.\n - Buying a 700-yen bell and a 780-yen bell costs 1480 yen.\n - Buying a 600-yen bell and a 780-yen bell costs 1380 yen.\nThe minimum among these is 1300 yen.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
