A set in Python is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements, so adding an item to the set will only add it if it is not already in the set. Therefore, the size of the set after all the items have been added will be the number of different kinds of items you have drawn.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), as each of the N items is added to the set in constant time. The space complexity is also O(N), as in the worst case all the N items could be different, and the set would need to store all of them.", "N = int(input())\nitems = set()\n\nfor _ in range(N):\n    items.add(input())\n\nprint(len(items))\n\n\nThis solution uses a set to store the items you've drawn. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. When you add an element to a set, it checks if the element is already in the set. If it is, the set does not add it again, which ensures that each item is only counted once. The length of the set is then the number of unique items you've drawn.\n\nThis solution works within the constraints because the maximum length of the string and the number of strings is relatively small. If these constraints were larger, you would need a more efficient solution.\n\nNote: The solution assumes that the order of the items does not matter. If the order matters, you would need to use a different data structure, such as a list or array, and check each item against every other item in the list or array.", "N = int(input())\nitems = set()\n\nfor _ in range(N):\n    items.add(input())\n\nprint(len(items))\n\n\nThe solution is simple. It uses a set to store the kinds of items. In Python, a set is a collection that is unordered and unindexed. It also doesn't allow duplicate values. So, when we add an item to the set, it will only be added if it's not already in the set. Therefore, the size of the set will be the number of different kinds of items.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it reads the input N times and adds each item to the set. The space complexity is also O(N) because in the worst case (when all items are different), the size of the set will be N.\n\nPlease note that the order of the items in the input doesn't affect the result. The set will always give the same result regardless of the order of the items.\n\nAlso note that this solution assumes that the input is correct and doesn't include error checking for incorrect inputs."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou drew lottery N times.
