The roads in Berland are one-way.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?\n\nNew roads will also be one-way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000, 0 \\le m \\le 5000, 1 \\le s \\le n$) \u2014 the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThe following $m$ lines contain roads: road $i$ is given as a pair of cities $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\ne v_i$). For each pair of cities $(u, v)$, there can be at most one road from $u$ to $v$. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $u$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $u$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city $s$. If all the cities are already reachable from $s$, print 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n9 9 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n1 5\n5 6\n6 1\n1 8\n9 8\n7 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is illustrated by the following: [Image] \n\nFor example, you can add roads ($6, 4$), ($7, 9$), ($1, 7$) to make all the cities reachable from $s = 1$.\n\nThe second example is illustrated by the following: [Image] \n\nIn this example, you can add any one of the roads ($5, 1$), ($5, 2$), ($5, 3$), ($5, 4$) to make all the cities reachable from $s = 5$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
