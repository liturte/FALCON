First, all roads in the city either along the north-south direction or along the east-west direction. Second, it\u2019s an extremely large city such that the sizes of blocks between different roads are negligible. Therefore, each position in this city can be represented by coordinates $(x, y)$ of real values.\n\nThe taxi drivers always takes the shortest path between the pick-up and drop-off points, following streets. Your company only operates the taxis within the central business district (CBD), which is a convex polygon of $n$ points.\n\nAssuming the pick-up and drop-off points from the passengers are chosen, uniformly at random, from inside the CBD, what is the expected distance that a taxi will travel? Assume the taxi travel distance between any points $(x, y)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ is always $|x-x_1|+|y-y_1|$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 100000$).\n\nFollowing this will be $n$ lines, each with two integer values values ($x, y$) representing the points on the border of CBD, where $|x|,|y| < 10^9$. The points are presented in a clockwise order and there will be no three points on the same line.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is a single line containing one number, the expected distance expressed with a relative or absolute error less than $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n1 1\n1 0\nSample Output 1:\n0.666666666666667\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n2 0\nSample Output 2:\n0.733333333333333\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
