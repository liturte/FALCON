A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex $i$ is equal to $a_i$.\n\nLet's denote the function $g(x, y)$ as the greatest common divisor of the numbers written on the vertices belonging to the simple path from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ (including these two vertices). Also let's denote $dist(x, y)$ as the number of vertices on the simple path between vertices $x$ and $y$, including the endpoints. $dist(x, x) = 1$ for every vertex $x$.\n\nYour task is calculate the maximum value of $dist(x, y)$ among such pairs of vertices that $g(x, y) > 1$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ \u2014 the number of vertices $(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ $(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ \u2014 the numbers written on vertices.\n\nThen $n - 1$ lines follow, each containing two integers $x$ and $y$ $(1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\ne y)$ denoting an edge connecting vertex $x$ with vertex $y$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no pair of vertices $x, y$ such that $g(x, y) > 1$, print $0$. Otherwise print the maximum value of $dist(x, y)$ among such pairs.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n2 3 4\n1 3\n2 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
