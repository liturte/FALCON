The i-th integer is A_i.\nTakahashi can perform the following two kinds of operations any number of times in any order:\n - Select one integer written on the board (let this integer be X). Write 2X on the board, without erasing the selected integer.\n - Select two integers, possibly the same, written on the board (let these integers be X and Y). Write X XOR Y (XOR stands for bitwise xor) on the blackboard, without erasing the selected integers.\nHow many different integers not exceeding X can be written on the blackboard? We will also count the integers that are initially written on the board.\nSince the answer can be extremely large, find the count modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 6\n - 1 \\leq X < 2^{4000}\n - 1 \\leq A_i < 2^{4000}(1\\leq i\\leq N)\n - All input values are integers.\n - X and A_i(1\\leq i\\leq N) are given in binary notation, with the most significant digit in each of them being 1.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\nA_1\n:\nA_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of different integers not exceeding X that can be written on the blackboard.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 111\n1111\n10111\n10010\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\nInitially, 15, 23 and 18 are written on the blackboard. Among the integers not exceeding 7, four integers, 0, 3, 5 and 6, can be written.\nFor example, 6 can be written as follows:\n - Double 15 to write 30.\n - Take XOR of 30 and 18 to write 12.\n - Double 12 to write 24.\n - Take XOR of 30 and 24 to write 6.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
