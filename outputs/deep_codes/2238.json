It uses a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the matrix. If the cell is on the main diagonal, on the anti-diagonal, on the row with the middle cell, or on the column with the middle cell, it appends \"D\" to the row. Otherwise, it appends \"", "n = int(input())\n\ndef crystal(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i == n//2 or j == n//2 or i+j == n-1:\n                print(\"D\", end=\"\")\n            else:\n                print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        print()\n\ncrystal(n)\n\n\nThis code first takes an input n. Then it defines a function called `crystal` that takes an integer n as an argument. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over each cell in a 2D grid of size n. If the cell is on the diagonal, the top, bottom, left or right of the matrix, or the cell is on the other diagonal, it prints \"D\". Otherwise, it prints \"*\". This results in a diamond-shaped pattern of \"D\"s and \"*\"s. The function is then called with the input n as the argument.", "n = int(input())\nmatrix = [['*' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    matrix[i][i] = 'D'\n    matrix[i][n-i-1] = 'D'\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(''.join(row))\n\n\nThis code works by first creating a 2D list (matrix) of size n x n filled with '*'. It then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix, setting the elements at the main diagonal and the antidiagonal to 'D'. Finally, it prints out the matrix, joining the rows into a string with no spaces.\n\nThe main diagonal of a matrix is the line of cells where the row number and the column number are the same. The antidiagonal of a matrix is the line of cells where the row number and the column number sum to the size of the matrix minus one (i.e., n-1).\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be a valid", "n = int(input())\n\n# Draw top part\nfor i in range((n+1)//2):\n    print(\"*\" * i + \"D\" + \"*\" * (n - 2*i - 2) + \"D\" + \"*\" * i)\n\n# Draw middle part\nprint(\"D\" * n)\n\n# Draw bottom part\nfor i in range((n-1)//2, -1, -1):\n    print(\"*\" * i + \"D\" + \"*\" * (n - 2*i - 2) + \"D\" + \"*\" * i)\n\n\nThis code first draws the top part of the crystal, then the middle part (which is just a single line of \"D\"), and finally the bottom part. For each part, it prints \"*\" repeated i times, followed by \"D\", followed by \"*\" repeated n - 2*i - 2 times, followed by \"D\" and then \"*\" repeated i times. The range of the for loop changes according to whether", "n = int(input())\n\ndef diamond(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == n//2 or j == n//2 or i == j and i <= n//2 or i+j == n-1 and i <= n//2:\n                print(\"D\", end = \"\")\n            else:\n                print(\"*\", end = \"\")\n        print()\n\ndiamond(n)\n\n\nThis code first takes the input and defines a function diamond that takes an integer n as an argument. This function then uses two nested for loops to iterate over each cell of the matrix. If the cell is in the middle row, middle column, or on the diagonal, it prints \"D\". Otherwise, it prints \"*\". Finally, it prints a newline character to move to the next row. The function is then called with the input value.\n\nThe output of this code is a crystal of size n drawn using \"D\" and \"*\" characters.\n\nNote:"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTwilight Sparkle once got a crystal from the Crystal Mine. A crystal of size n (n is odd; n > 1) is an n \u00d7 n matrix with a diamond inscribed into it.\n\nYou are given an odd integer n. You need to draw a crystal of size n. The diamond cells of the matrix should be represented by character \"D\". All other cells of the matrix should be represented by character \"*\".
