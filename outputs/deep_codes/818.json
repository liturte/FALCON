It does this by concatenating n 2s, n 5s, and n 7s together. The int() function is used to convert the result to an integer, as the problem statement specifies the output should be an integer.\n\nThe function min_prime_number() checks if n is 1. If n is 1, it returns -1 because a number with 1 digit can't be divisible by any other number. If n is not 1, it returns the generated number.\n\nFinally, the program reads an integer from the input and calls min_prime_number() with this integer as the argument. The result is printed to the output.\n\nThe time complexity of", "def min_prime_number(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 2*3*5*7*10**(n-4)\n\nprint(min_prime_number(int(input())))\n\n\nThis code works by first checking if the input is 1. If it is, it returns -1 because there is no number of length 1 that is divisible by all prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7). \n\nIf the input is not 1, it returns the minimum possible number of length n that is divisible by all prime numbers. This is calculated by multiplying all the prime numbers together (2*3*5*7) and then multiplying that by 10 raised to the power of n-4. The -4 is because the 2*3*5*7*10**(n-4) part of the calculation will give a number of length n-4, and we want a number of length n.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is a valid integer and that it", "def min_number(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return int('2357' * (n // 4) + '235'[n % 4])\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_number(n))\n\n\nThis solution works by creating a string of 2, 3, 5, and 7 repeated n // 4 times. Then it adds the corresponding digit from the '235' string to the end of the string to make the length of the string exactly n. If n is less than 3, it returns -1.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that a number is divisible by all numbers Willy already knows if and only if it is divisible by the least common multiple of these numbers (which is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210). Therefore, the minimum number of length n that is divisible by all numbers Willy already knows is the number with digits '2357' repeated n // 4 times, followed by the corresponding digit", "from functools import reduce\nfrom operator import mul\n\ndef min_prime_multiple(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return -1\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n    if n == 3:\n        return reduce(mul, primes)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return reduce(mul, primes[:3]) * pow(5, n//2)\n    return reduce(mul, primes) * pow(2, n-3)\n\nprint(min_prime_multiple(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python program uses the built-in `reduce` function and `operator` module's `mul` function to calculate the product of all prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) up to a certain number. It then checks the input number `n` to see if it's less than 3 or if it's even. If `n` is less than 3, it returns -1.

If `n` is 1, it returns -1 because there is no number of length 1. Otherwise, it returns the product of these prime numbers and 10 raised to the power of `n - 4`. The reason for `n - 4` is to account for the length of the other prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) and the leading 2, 3, 5 and 7 in the number.\n\nThe input `n` is read from the standard input, and the result of `min_prime_number(n)"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nChilly Willy loves playing with numbers.
