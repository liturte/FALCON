Geppetto is trying to make the best pizza possible, but at the same time he doesn\u2019t want to have a small selection of pizzas.\n\nHe makes his pizzas out of $N$ ingredients marked with numbers from $1$ to $N$. All that would be simple if he could mix any ingredient with every ingredient on the pizza, but unfortunately, that is not the case. Sometimes some ingredients cannot mix and that creates additional complications for our pizza master.\n\nThere are $M$ pairs of ingredients that cannot be on the same pizza at the same time. Given these restrictions, Geppetto wants to know how many different pizzas he can make. Help him answer this question. Two pizzas are considered different if there is an ingredient of index $i$ that is on one pizza, but not on the other.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 20$, $0 \\leq M \\leq 400$). Each of the following $M$ lines contains two different numbers $a$ and $b$, they represent the prohibition of mixing ingredients marked with $a$ and $b$ on the pizza. ($1 \\leq a, b\\leq N$). All pairs of ingredients are not necessarily distinct, some pair could occur multiple times.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the number of different pizzas given the restrictions in the task.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\nSample Output 1:\n5\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 0\nSample Output 2:\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
