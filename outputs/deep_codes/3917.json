However, they can't both qualify to an important contest. The selection will be made with the help of a single problem. Blatnatalag, a friend of Iahub, managed to get hold of the problem before the contest. Because he wants to make sure Iahub will be the one qualified, he tells Iahub the following task.\n\nYou're given an (1-based) array a with n elements. Let's define function f(i, j) (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n) as (i - j)^2 + g(i, j)^2. Function g is calculated by the following pseudo-code:\n\n\n\nint g(int i, int j) {\n\n    int sum = 0;\n\n    for (int k = min(i, j) + 1; k <= max(i, j); k = k + 1)\n\n        sum = sum + a[k];\n\n    return sum;\n\n}\n\n\n\nFind a value min_{i} \u2260 j\u00a0\u00a0f(i, j).\n\nProbably by now Iahub already figured out the solution to this problem. Can you?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100000). Next line contains n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] ( - 10^4 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 10^4). \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the value of min_{i} \u2260 j\u00a0\u00a0f(i, j).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 0 0 -1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2\n1 -1\n\nOutput\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
