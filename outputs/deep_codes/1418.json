For each number, if it hasn't been assigned a value yet, it assigns the smallest possible value to all multiples of that number. This ensures that all multiples of a number are assigned the same value, which satisfies the condition that for any pair of integers (i", "n = int(input())\nif n == 2:\n    print(2, 1)\nelse:\n    print(2, 1, 2)\n    for i in range(4, n+1):\n        print(i+1)\n\nIn this solution, for $n=2$, we simply print $2, 1$. For $n=3$, we print $2, 1, 2$. For $n>3$, we print $2, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n+1$.

For every integer $i$ from $2$ to $n$, assign a positive integer $a_i$ such that the following conditions hold:  For any pair of integers $(i,j)$, if $i$ and $j$ are coprime, $a_i \\neq a_j$.  The maximal value of all $a_i$ should be minimized (that is, as small as possible). \n\nA pair of integers is called coprime if their greatest common divisor is $1$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n-1$ integers, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\\ldots$, $a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$). \n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n1 2 1 \nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2 1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, notice that $3$ and $4$ are coprime, so $a_3 \\neq a_4$. Also, notice that $a=[1,2,3]$ satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is $3$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
