The divisors of $5$ are $1$ and $5$, the smallest one except $1$ is $5$. Therefore, the only operation adds $f(5)=5$ to $5$, and the result is $10$.\n\nIn the second query, $n=8$ and $k=2$. The divisors of $8$ are $1,2,4,8$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, then after one operation $8$ turns into $8+(f(8)=2)=10$. The divisors of $10$ are $1,2,5,10$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, therefore the answer is $10+(f(10)=2)=12$.\n\nIn the third query, $n$ is changed as follows: $3 \\to 6 \\to 8 \\to 10 \\to 12$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
