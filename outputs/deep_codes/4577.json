The split function is used to separate the input string by spaces. The condition A <= C <= B checks if C is not less than A and not greater than B.\n\nThe print function is used to output the result.\n\nThis code is simple and efficient, and it should meet the problem constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\nA, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A <= C <= B:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThe code reads the input, converts it to integers, and checks if C is between A and B (inclusive). If it is, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\nA, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A <= C <= B:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThe code reads the input, converts it to integers, and checks if C is between A and B", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yes\" if A <= C <= B else \"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses Python's conditional expression (a.k.a. ternary operator), which is a compact way to write if-else statements. It reads as \"if A <= C and C <= B, then print 'Yes', else print 'No'\". It's equivalent to the following if-else statement:\n\n\nif A <= C and C <= B:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nBoth codes read three integers A, B, and C from the input, then print \"Yes\" if C is between A and B (inclusive), and \"No\" otherwise.\n\"\"\"\n\n# SOLUTION:\nA, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yes\" if A <= C <= B else \"No\")\n\n# Explanation:\n# This solution uses Python's conditional expression (a.k.a. ternary operator), which is a compact way to write if-else statements. \n# It reads as \"if A <= C and C <= B, then print 'Yes', else print 'No'\". \n# It's equivalent to the following if-else statement:\n\n# if A <= C and C <= B:\n#     print(\"Yes\")\n# else:\n#", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif not C < A and not C > B:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(A + B + C)\n\n\nThis code reads the three integers A, B, C from the standard input.
