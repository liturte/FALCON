Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $1$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $3$ steps, and the second contains $4$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nYou are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.\n\nThe given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.\n\nThe second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $x$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $1, 2, \\dots, x$ in that order.\n\nThe given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, output $t$ \u2014 the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $t$ numbers \u2014 the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n1 2 3 1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n3 4 \nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n1 1 1 1 \nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n1\n5 \nInput\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n3\n2 2 1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
