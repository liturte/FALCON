The idea is to calculate the prefix sum of the array A modulo K and count the number of elements with the same remainder. Then, for each element, we can calculate the number of subsequences that end at this element. This number is the number of elements with the same remainder minus one (because we cannot include the element itself). We then divide this number by 2 to get the number of non-empty subsequences.

Then it counts the number of subsequences that end at each index and have a sum that is a multiple of K.\n\nIt does this by iterating over the frequency count and using", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nMOD = 10**9+7\n\ndp = [0]*K\ndp[0] = 1\ncum = [0]*(N+1)\ncumsum = [0]*(N+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, N+1):\n    dp2 = dp[:]\n    cum[i] = (cum[i-1]+A[i-1])%K\n    dp[cum[i]] += 1\n    cumsum[i] = (cumsum[i-1]+dp2[cum[i]])%MOD\n\n    for j in range(K):\n        dp[j] = (dp[j]+dp2[j])%MOD\n\nprint((cumsum[N]-dp[0])%MOD)\n\n\nThis Python script uses dynamic programming to solve the problem", "import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nN, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nA = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nprefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\nfor i in range(N):\n    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + A[i]) % K\n\ncounter = defaultdict(int)\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(N + 1):\n    result += counter[prefix_sum[i]]\n    counter[prefix_sum[i]] += 1\n\nprint(result)\n\nThis code is a Python solution for the problem.
