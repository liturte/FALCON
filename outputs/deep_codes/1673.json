Calculate the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly $k$. As this number can be very large, output it modulo $998244353$.\n\nA sequence $a$ is a subsequence of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n, k$ ($2 \\le k \\le n \\le 1000$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly $k$. As this number can be very large, output it modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 7 3 5\n\nOutput\n8\nInput\n5 5\n1 10 100 1000 10000\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $4$ subsequences of length $3$\u00a0\u2014 $[1, 7, 3]$, $[1, 3, 5]$, $[7, 3, 5]$, $[1, 7, 5]$, each of which has beauty $2$, so answer is $8$.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one subsequence of length $5$\u00a0\u2014 the whole array, which has the beauty equal to $|10-1| = 9$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
