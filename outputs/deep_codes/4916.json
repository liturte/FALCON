The art installation consists of a floor with an $n\\! \\times \\! n$ matrix of square tiles. Each tile holds a single number from $1$ to $k$. You want to play hopscotch on it. You want to start on some tile numbered $1$, then hop to some tile numbered $2$, then $3$, and so on, until you reach some tile numbered $k$.
