As part of their plan to dominate the university, they have employed you to write their nefarious software. Their goal is to eliminate all duplicated words from all texts in the English department, because, as they say, \u201cduplicated words are duplicated work\u201d and \u201cduplicated work wastes money.\u201d Actually, what they would really say is \u201cduplicated words are . work\u201d and \u201c. . wastes money\u201d. This is what your program should do \u2013 remove all duplicate words and replace them with a period.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is a textbook with at most $2000$ lines. Each line contains up to $100$ characters. Punctuation does not appear (it has already been removed by another programmer); words are made up of up to $20$ lower and uppercase characters (a\u2013z). There are at most $20000$ total words in the input. Each pair of adjacent words is separated by a single space. Case does not matter when comparing words for duplicates (i.e. \u2018Book\u2019 and \u2018book\u2019 and \u2018bOoK\u2019 should be considered the same word). Input ends at end of file.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint each word the first time it appears, but thereafter if that word appears again print a period.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nEngineering will save the world from inefficiency\nInefficiency is a blight on the world and its\nhumanity\nSample Output:\nEngineering will save the world from inefficiency\n. is a blight on . . and its\nhumanity\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
