The dfs function is a recursive function that takes in a list of numbers, a path (the current subset), and a result list. It adds the path to the result list and then iterates over the input list. For each number, it recursively calls itself with the remaining numbers and the current path plus the number. The if statement inside the for loop is used to skip duplicates.\n\nThe subsetsWithDup function first sorts the input list and then calls the dfs function with an empty path and the result list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the input list. This is because in the worst case scenario, each element in the list can be in or out of a subset, resulting in 2^N subsets. The space complexity is also O(N", "class Solution:\n    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        res = []\n        nums.sort()\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], res)\n        return res\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, res):\n        res.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            if i > index and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\n                continue\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], res)\n\n\nThis solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to generate all possible subsets. The key difference between this problem and the \"subsets\" problem is the sorting of the input list. This is to handle the case where there are duplicate numbers in the input list. If we don't sort the list, we might end up with duplicate subsets if we choose to include the same number multiple times.\n\nThe dfs function is a recursive function that generates all possible subsets by adding one number at a time to the current subset. It does this by calling itself with the next index and the current subset appended with the next number. If the next number is the same as the current number, it skips this iteration to avoid generating duplicate subsets.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when the current index is equal to the length of the input list. In this case, the function adds the current subset to the", "class Solution:\n    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        res = []\n        nums.sort()\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], res)\n        return res\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, res):\n        res.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            if i > index and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\n                continue\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], res)\n\n\nThis code uses depth-first search (DFS) to find all possible subsets. The main difference is that it sorts the input list first, and then skips the duplicates by checking if the current number is the same as the previous one.\n\nThe dfs function takes four parameters: the input list, the starting index, the current path, and the result list. It starts by adding the current path to the result list. Then it iterates over the remaining part of the input list, and recursively calls dfs for each remaining element. The path is updated by appending the current element to the path. The index is updated to the next position, and the function continues this process until all elements have been processed.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result list, which contains all possible subsets of the input list, without duplicates.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N * 2^", "class Solution:\n    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        nums.sort()\n        result = []\n        self.dfs(nums, 0, [], result)\n        return result\n\n    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, result):\n        result.append(path)\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            if i > index and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\n                continue\n            self.dfs(nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]], result)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the possible subsets.
