His favorite chocolate bar consists of pieces, each piece may contain a nut. Bob wants to break the bar of chocolate into multiple pieces so that each part would contain exactly one nut and any break line goes between two adjacent pieces.\n\nYou are asked to calculate the number of ways he can do it. Two ways to break chocolate are considered distinct if one of them contains a break between some two adjacent pieces and the other one doesn't. \n\nPlease note, that if Bob doesn't make any breaks, all the bar will form one piece and it still has to have exactly one nut.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces in the chocolate bar.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1), where 0 represents a piece without the nut and 1 stands for a piece with the nut.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of ways to break the chocolate into multiple parts so that each part would contain exactly one nut.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n0 1 0\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5\n1 0 1 0 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample there is exactly one nut, so the number of ways equals 1\u00a0\u2014 Bob shouldn't make any breaks.\n\nIn the second sample you can break the bar in four ways:\n\n10|10|1\n\n1|010|1\n\n10|1|01\n\n1|01|01\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
