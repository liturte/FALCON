There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.\n\nHelp him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^3$, $1 \\le s \\le 10^{12}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of kegs and glass volume.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$ ($1 \\le v_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the volume of $i$-th keg.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 how much kvass in the least keg can be.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n4 3 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3 4\n5 3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 7\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.\n\nIn the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.\n\nIn the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
