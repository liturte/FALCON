The first input is the age of the user, and depending on this value, the program will print \"Hello World\" or the sum of two numbers. The `int()` function is used to convert the input to an integer.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., it will always be either 1 or 2, and for the second case, A and B will be integers between 1 and 9", "N = int(input())\nif N == 1:\n    print(\"Hello World\")\nelse:\n    A = int(input())\n    B = int(input())\n    print(A + B)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program first reads the input N.
