Observe that both 8 are the minimum. Considering the first 8, look at the corresponding column (containing 8 and 6). Here, 8 is the largest element in that column. So it will be chosen.\nExample 2: There is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column.\nExample 3: The required gift in matrix is not determined uniquely, but the required cost is determined uniquely.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
