Today you\u2019re at the rear of a long line, brooding over the others\u2019 inability to keep proper distance to the car in front. But are you really keeping your own distance?\n\nYou have calculated that in order to never have to use your breaks, you must keep a distance to any car $x$ in front of you at least $p(n+1)$ where $n$ is the number of cars between you and $x$, and $p$ is an integer constant determined by which of your cars you are currently driving.\n\nGiven the value of $p$ and the current distances (in random order) to each of the cars ahead of you, calculate the minimum distance you should be keeping to the car directly in front, in order to not have to use your breaks.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst a line with $1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$ \u2013 the number of cars ahead of you \u2013 and $1 \\leq p \\leq 20$ \u2013 the deceleration constant.\n\nThen a single line with $n$ unique integers denoting the current distance to each of the cars ahead of you. Each of these integers are in the interval $[1, 10^7]$\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\nThe minimum distance you must keep to the car directly in front, in order to not have to use your breaks.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 1\n1 2 4\nSample Output:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
