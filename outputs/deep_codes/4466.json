The result is the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat.\n\nIn the given sample input, the seat length is 13 centimeters, each person will occupy an interval of length 3 centimeters, and there must be a gap of length 1 centimeter between two people. The solution calculates the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat by subtracting 3 from 13, and then dividing by 4 (3 + 2*1), which gives 3. So, the maximum", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nprint((X - Y - 2*Z) // (Y + 2*Z))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of people who can sit on the seat is determined by the formula (X - Y - 2*Z) // (Y + 2*Z). This formula calculates the maximum number of people that can fit in the seat without overlapping. The \"//\" operator is used for division to get an integer result. The \"-\" operator is used for subtraction, and the \"*\" operator is used for multiplication. The \"()\" are used to group the operations for clarity.\n\nThis code reads the input values X, Y, and Z from the user, calculates the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat, and then prints this number.\n\nPlease note that the input and output format of the problem statement and the code are consistent, so there is no need to provide additional explanations.", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nprint((X - Y - Z) // (Y + 2*Z))\n\n\nThis code reads the input values X, Y, and Z from the user. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat by dividing the total length of the seat by the length of each person's interval, taking into account the minimum gap of Z centimeters.\n\nThe calculation is done using integer division (//), which discards the fractional part and gives the largest whole number. This is because we can't have a fraction of a person.\n\nFor example, if X=13, Y=3, and Z=1, then the total length of the seat is 13, the length of each person's interval is 3+2*1=5, and the minimum gap is 1. So the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat is (13-5-1)//5 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the code prints the number 2.", "X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\nprint((X - Y - 2 * Z) // (Y + 2 * Z))\n\n\nThis Python code will read the input values X, Y, and Z from the user, and then print the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat.

The seat width is X centimeters, each person will occupy an interval of length Y centimeters, and there must be a gap of at least Z centimeters between two people and between the end of the seat and a person.\n\nThe solution is to calculate the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat by subtracting the total occupied length from the total seat width and dividing by the total length each person can occupy. The result is the maximum number of people that can sit on the seat.\n\nThe constraints ensure that there is enough room for at least one person to sit on the seat, so the result will be at least 1.\n\nThe input is read from standard input in the format \"X Y Z\", and the result is printed to standard output.\n\nThe code is a single line Python code that does the calculation and prints the result."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have a long seat of width X centimeters.\nThere are many people who wants to sit here.
