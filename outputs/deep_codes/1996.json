After the second action we can note that the selected letter is not a. Valentin tells word \"b\" and doesn't get a shock. After that it is clear that the selected letter is c, but Valentin pronounces the word cd and gets an excessive electric shock. \n\nIn the second test case after the first two electric shocks we understand that the selected letter is e or o. Valentin tries some words consisting of these letters and after the second word it's clear that the selected letter is e, but Valentin makes 3 more actions before he makes a correct hypothesis.\n\nIn the third example the selected letter can be uniquely determined only when Valentin guesses it, so he didn't get excessive electric shocks.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
