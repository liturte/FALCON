{"709": {"code": ["print(bin(int(input())).count('1'))\n\n\nThis Python code works by converting the input number to binary and counting the number of 1's in the binary representation. The number of 1's in the binary representation of a number is equal to the minimum number of bacteria needed to add to the box to reach that number.\n\nFor example, if the input is 5 (binary 101), there are 2 1's, so the minimum number of bacteria needed is 2. If the input is 8 (binary 1000), there is 1 1, so the minimum number of bacteria needed is 1.\n\nThe bin function converts an integer number to a binary string, and the count method counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or zero", "def min_bacteria(x):\n    return bin(x).count('1')\n\nx = int(input())\nprint(min_bactera(x))\n\nThis solution works by converting the input number to binary and counting the number of 1s in the binary representation. This is because in each night, every bacterium splits into two, which is equivalent to doubling the number of bacteria in the box. Therefore, the number of bacteria in the box is effectively the number of 1s in the binary representation of the input number.\n\nFor example, if x = 8, the binary representation of x is 1000. There are three 1s in this binary representation, so the minimum number of bacteria needed to put into the box is 3.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be a floating point number or negative, additional error checking may be needed.", "def min_bacteria(x):\n    return bin(x).count('1')\n\nprint(min_bacteria(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code works by converting the input number to binary and counting the number of 1s in the binary representation. This is equivalent to counting the number of times we need to divide the number by 2 until it becomes 0, which is the minimum number of bacteria needed to get to the target number.\n\nThis is because each night, every bacterium splits into two bacteria. So, we can think of the process as performing a binary division. Each time we perform a binary division, we are essentially adding one more bacterium to the box. Therefore, the number of binary divisions (or 1s in the binary representation of the number) is the minimum number of bacteria needed to get to the target number.\n\nThis solution works because the number of bacteria needed", "def min_bacteria(x):\n    return bin(x).count('1')\n\nprint(min_bacteria(int(input())))\n\nThis code works by converting the input number into binary form and then counting the number of 1's in that binary form. This is equivalent to counting the number of times we need to split the bacteria in the process of reaching the desired count.\n\nIt's worth noting that this code assumes that the input is a valid positive integer. If the input could be invalid, you should add error checking to handle that case.\n\nThis solution is based on the observation that each night, every bacterium in the box splits into two bacteria. This means that the number of bacteria in the box at any given moment is exactly half the number of bacteria at the previous moment, plus the number of new bacteria added. Therefore, to reach a desired count, we need to add as many new bacteria as needed to", "print(bin(int(input())).count('1'))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe bin function converts the given number into binary form and count function counts the number of 1s in the binary number. The binary representation of a number has a '1' bit at the position where that number is a power of 2. Therefore, the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of a number is the minimum number of bacteria needed to add to the box to reach that number.\n\nFor example, the binary representation of 5 is 101. Here, there are two '1' bits, so the minimum number of bacteria needed to add to the box to reach 5 is 2. The binary representation of 8 is 1000. Here, there is one '1' bit, so the minimum number of bacteria needed to add to the box to reach 8 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are a lover of bacteria. You want to raise some bacteria in a box. \n\nInitially, the box is empty. Each morning, you can put any number of bacteria into the box. And each night, every bacterium in the box will split into two bacteria. You hope to see exactly x bacteria in the box at some moment. \n\nWhat is the minimum number of bacteria you need to put into the box across those days?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line containing one integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line containing one integer: the answer.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n8\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, we can add one bacterium in the box in the first day morning and at the third morning there will be 4 bacteria in the box. Now we put one more resulting 5 in the box. We added 2 bacteria in the process so the answer is 2.\n\nFor the second sample, we can put one in the first morning and in the 4-th morning there will be 8 in the box. So the answer is 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
