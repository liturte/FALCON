We ask you to process them in order.\nThere are two kinds of queries. Their input format and description are as follows:\n - 1 x: Place a white stone on (1, x). After that, for each black stone between (1, x) and the first white stone you hit if you go down from (1, x), replace it with a white stone.\n - 2 x: Place a white stone on (x, 1). After that, for each black stone between (x, 1) and the first white stone you hit if you go right from (x, 1), replace it with a white stone.\nHow many black stones are there on the grid after processing all Q queries?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 3 \\leq N \\leq 2\\times 10^5\n - 0 \\leq Q \\leq \\min(2N-4,2\\times 10^5)\n - 2 \\leq x \\leq N-1\n - Queries are pairwise distinct.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN Q\nQuery_1\n\\vdots\nQuery_Q\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint how many black stones there are on the grid after processing all Q queries.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 5\n1 3\n2 3\n1 4\n2 2\n1 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nAfter each query, the grid changes in the following way:\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
