The mirroring of matrix b is a 2x \u00d7 y matrix c which has the following properties:\n\n  the upper half of matrix c (rows with numbers from 1 to x) exactly matches b;  the lower half of matrix c (rows with numbers from x + 1 to 2x) is symmetric to the upper one; the symmetry line is the line that separates two halves (the line that goes in the middle, between rows x and x + 1). \n\nSereja has an n \u00d7 m matrix a. He wants to find such matrix b, that it can be transformed into matrix a, if we'll perform on it several (possibly zero) mirrorings. What minimum number of rows can such matrix contain?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers, n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100). Each of the next n lines contains m integers \u2014 the elements of matrix a. The i-th line contains integers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im} (0 \u2264 a_{ij} \u2264 1) \u2014 the i-th row of the matrix a.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line, print the answer to the problem \u2014 the minimum number of rows of matrix b.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 0 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 3\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n8 1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test sample the answer is a 2 \u00d7 3 matrix b:\n\n\n\n001\n\n110\n\n\n\nIf we perform a mirroring operation with this matrix, we get the matrix a that is given in the input:\n\n\n\n001\n\n110\n\n110\n\n001\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
