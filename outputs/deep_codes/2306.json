Similarly, in the subsequent t_2 seconds, a train must run at a speed of at most v_2 m/s, and so on.\nAccording to the specifications of the trains, the acceleration of a train must be always within \u00b11m/s^2. Additionally, a train must stop at the beginning and the end of the run.\nFind the maximum possible distance that a train can cover in the run.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq t_i \\leq 200\n - 1 \\leq v_i \\leq 100\n - All input values are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nt_1 t_2 t_3 \u2026 t_N\nv_1 v_2 v_3 \u2026 v_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum possible that a train can cover in the run.\n\nOutput is considered correct if its absolute difference from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n100\n30\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2100.000000000000000\n\n\nThe maximum distance is achieved when a train runs as follows:\n - In the first 30 seconds, it accelerates at a rate of 1m/s^2, covering 450 meters.\n - In the subsequent 40 seconds, it maintains the velocity of 30m/s, covering 1200 meters.\n - In the last 30 seconds, it decelerates at the acceleration of -1m/s^2, covering 450 meters.\nThe total distance covered is 450 + 1200 + 450 = 2100 meters.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
