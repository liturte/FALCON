It does this by checking if the total number of animals is less than X or if the number of dogs is less than the difference between X and A (the number of known cats). If either of these conditions is true, it prints \"NO\", otherwise it prints \"YES\".\n\nThe condition A + B < X checks if there are less animals than the required number of cats.\nThe condition B < X - A checks if there are less dogs than the required number of cats. If both these conditions are true, it means that there are not enough known cats or dogs to make X cats, so the program prints \"NO\". Otherwise, the program prints \"YES\".", "A, B, X = map(int, input().split())\nprint('YES' if A <= X <= A + B else 'NO')\n\n\nThis solution uses the concept of Python's conditional (ternary) operator. It first checks if X is greater than or equal to A, and if it is, it checks if X is less than or equal to A + B. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement, and that A, B, and X will be integers within the specified range. It does not include any error checking or handling for invalid input.\n\nAlso, the solution uses the built-in `map` function to read the input from the standard input, and the `input().split()` function to split the input into separate values. These values are then converted to integers using the `int` function. The result is a tuple of three integers, which are immediately unpacked into the variables A, B, and X.\n\nFinally, the solution uses the `print` function to output the result. If the condition is satisfied, it outputs 'YES', otherwise it outputs 'NO'.\n\nThis solution is a direct", "A, B, X = map(int, input().split())\nif X > A + B or X < A:\n    print('NO')\nelse:\n    print('YES')\n\n\nThis Python code reads three integers A, B, and X from the input, and checks if it is possible that there are exactly X cats among A + B animals. If X is greater than the total number of animals (A + B) or less than the known number of cats (A), it is impossible. If it is possible, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works in O(1) time.\n\"\"\"\n\nA, B, X = map(int, input().split())\nif X > A + B or X < A:\n    print('NO')\nelse:\n\nprint('YES')\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nThis solution is efficient and works in O(1) time.\n\"\"\"\n\nA, B, X = map(int, input().split())\nif X > A + B or X < A:\n    print('NO')\nelse:\n    print('YES')\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nThis solution is efficient and works in", "A, B, X = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B < X or X < A:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\n\nThis solution works by first checking if the total number of animals (A + B) is less than X or if X is less than A, both of which would mean that it is impossible for X cats to exist. If neither of these conditions are met, then it is possible for X cats to exist, so the program prints \"YES\".\n\nThis solution is correct because it simply checks the constraints given in the problem statement. If the total number of animals is less than X, or if X is less than the number of known cats, then it is impossible for X cats to exist. If these conditions are not met, then it is possible for X cats to exist, so the program prints \"YES\".\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThis solution has a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the input values and the output.\n\nThis solution is efficient and correct.\n\nThis solution is written in Python and does not use", "A, B, X = map(int, input().split())\n\nif X > A + B or X < A:\n    print('NO')\nelse:\n    print('YES')\n\n\nThis program reads the values of A, B, and X from the standard input. Then it checks if X is in the range of A and A + B (inclusive). If X is in this range, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.\n\nThe range of X is determined by the fact that X must be greater than or equal to the number of known cats (A) and less than or equal to the total number of animals (A + B). If X is not in this range, it is impossible to have exactly X cats among A + B animals, so the program prints 'NO'.
