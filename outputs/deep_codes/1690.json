There are $a_i$ chocolates of type $i$ in stock.\n\nYou have unlimited amount of cash (so you are not restricted by any prices) and want to buy as many chocolates as possible. However if you buy $x_i$ chocolates of type $i$ (clearly, $0 \\le x_i \\le a_i$), then for all $1 \\le j < i$ at least one of the following must hold:  $x_j = 0$ (you bought zero chocolates of type $j$) $x_j < x_i$ (you bought less chocolates of type $j$ than of type $i$) \n\nFor example, the array $x = [0, 0, 1, 2, 10]$ satisfies the requirement above (assuming that all $a_i \\ge x_i$), while arrays $x = [0, 1, 0]$, $x = [5, 5]$ and $x = [3, 2]$ don't.\n\nCalculate the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), denoting the number of types of chocolate.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), denoting the number of chocolates of each type.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 1 3 6\n\nOutput\n10\nInput\n5\n3 2 5 4 10\n\nOutput\n20\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, it is optimal to buy: $0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 6$ chocolates.\n\nIn the second example, it is optimal to buy: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10$ chocolates.\n\nIn the third example, it is optimal to buy: $0 + 0 + 0 + 1$ chocolates.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
