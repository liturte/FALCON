This is because we can use a single color balloon for each table.\n\nThen, we add the quotient of the sum of the number of balloons and 3. This is because we can decorate each of the remaining balloons with a pair of different colored balloons.\n\nThe reason we add the quotient instead of the remainder is that we can decorate each of the remaining balloons with a pair of different colored balloons. This is because we can decorate each of", "r, g, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint((r//3) + (g//3) + (b//3) + min(r%3, g%3, b%3))\n\n\nThis solution works by first calculating the number of full sets of 3 balloons each color can be used for, which is done by integer division by 3. Then, if there are any remaining balls of any color (i.e., the remainder when divided by 3), we need to use at least one of these to complete a table. We therefore take the minimum of the remainders and add this to the total.\n\nThis solution assumes that the question is asking for the maximum number of tables that can be decorated, not the maximum number of balloons that can be used.", "r, g, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(r, g, b) + (r + g + b) // 3)\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe can decorate the table with the same color balloons in a way that we have as many tables as the minimum number of balloons of any color. So, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the same color balloons is min(r, g, b).\n\nThen, we can decorate the rest of the balloons with different color balloons. For each set of three different color balloons, we can decorate one table. So, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with different color balloons is (r + g + b) // 3.\n\nThe total", "r, g, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(r, g, b) + (r+g+b)//3)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe idea is to decorate each table with three different colored balloons. The number of tables that can be decorated is the minimum of the number of each colored balloons. Then, if there are still balloons left, we can decorate them with any of the remaining balloons, but the maximum number of tables we can decorate is the total number of balloons divided by 3. This is because each 3 balloons can decorate one table.\n\nFor example, if we have 2 red, 3 green and 3 blue balloons, we can decorate 2 tables with red and green,", "r, g, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(r, g, b) + (max(r, g, b) - min(r, g, b)) // 2)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe idea is to use all the colors with at least one balloon. So, we choose the minimum number of balloons among r, g, b and decorate them with one color.\n\nThen, the remaining balloons can be used to decorate the other tables. We can use two balloons for each table, so we use (max(r, g, b) - min(r, g, b)) // 2 tables.\n\nThis way, we can cover all the balloons and decorate as many tables as possible."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?\n\nYour task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 \u2264 r, g, b \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer t \u2014 the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 4 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2 3 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: \"rgg\", \"gbb\", \"brr\", \"rrg\", where \"r\", \"g\" and \"b\" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
