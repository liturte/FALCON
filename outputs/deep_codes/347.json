Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia.

Therefore, he gets $(1 - \\frac{119}{250}) = \\frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10\u00b7100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
