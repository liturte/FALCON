He didn\u2019t notice anything strange until he started coding in his favorite editor, Bim (Bjarki IMproved). Usually when he\u2019s writing in an editor and presses the backspace key a single character is erased to the left. But after the update pressing that key outputs the character <. He\u2019s tested all the editors on his machine, Bmacs, Neobim, bjedit, NoteBjad++ and Subjark Text, but they all seem to have the same problem. He doesn\u2019t have time to search the web for a solution, and instead decides to temporarily circumvent the issue with a simple program.\n\nHelp Bjarki write a program that takes as input the string that was written in the text editor, and outputs the string as Bjarki intended to write it. You can assume that Bjarki never intended to write the character <, and that Bjarki never pressed the backspace key in an empty line.\n\n-----Input-----\nOne line containing the string that was written in the text editor. The length of the string is at most $10^6$, and it will only contain lowercase letters from the English alphabet as well as the character <.\n\n-----Output-----\nOne line containing the string as Bjarki intended to write it.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\na<bc<\nSample Output 1:\nb\n\nSample Input 2:\nfoss<<rritun\nSample Output 2:\nforritun\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
