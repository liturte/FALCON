Paper!\n\nAfter Karen have found the deterministic winning (losing?) strategy for rock-paper-scissors, her brother, Koyomi, comes up with a new game as a substitute. The game works as follows.\n\nA positive integer n is decided first. Both Koyomi and Karen independently choose n distinct positive integers, denoted by x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} and y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n} respectively. They reveal their sequences, and repeat until all of 2n integers become distinct, which is the only final state to be kept and considered.\n\nThen they count the number of ordered pairs (i, j) (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n) such that the value x_{i} xor y_{j} equals to one of the 2n integers. Here xor means the bitwise exclusive or operation on two integers, and is denoted by operators ^ and/or xor in most programming languages.\n\nKaren claims a win if the number of such pairs is even, and Koyomi does otherwise.
