The range(max(A)) generates all possible values of m from 0 to the maximum value of A.\n\nThe max() function then finds the maximum value in this list, which is the maximum value of f.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is valid and does not check for errors.", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max((sum(i % a for a in A) for i in range(max(A)))))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads the number of integers N and the N integers from the input. It then calculates the maximum value of f by iterating over all possible values of m (from 0 to the maximum value of a_i) and calculating f(m). The maximum of these values is the answer. The calculation of f(m) is done by summing the remainder of m divided by each a_i.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N*max(a_i)*max(a_i)) = O(N*10^5*10^5) which is feasible given the constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max((sum(i % a for a in A) for i", "import sys\n\ndef max_f(n, a):\n    max_val = max(a)\n    max_f = 0\n    for m in range(max_val):\n        f = sum(m % ai for ai in a)\n        max_f = max(max_f, f)\n    return max_f\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\nprint(max_f(n, a))\n\n\nThis code first calculates the maximum value in the array a. Then, it iterates over all non-negative integers less than this maximum value, calculates the value of f for each m, and keeps track of the maximum value of f. Finally, it returns the maximum value of f.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is given through the standard input in the format specified in the problem statement.

This is because the remainder of the division of m by a_i will be as small as possible when m is as large as possible.\n\nThe solution uses a combination of list comprehension and the built-in max function in Python to find the maximum value of f(m) for all possible values of m. The max function is given a generator that computes the maximum value of f(m) for each possible value of m. The generator uses a list comprehension to compute the maximum value of the remainder of the division of m by each of the a_i's for all possible values of", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max(sum(m % a for a in A) for m in range(max(A))))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses a combination of list comprehensions and built-in Python functions. \n\nThe first line reads the number of elements N and stores it in the variable N. \n\nThe second line reads N integers from the input, splits them into a list and stores it in the variable A.\n\nThe print statement calculates the maximum value of f(m) for m in the range from 0 to the maximum element in A. It does this by iterating over all possible values of m, calculating the sum of the remainder of m divided by each element in A, and then taking the maximum of these sums.\n\nThe result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is correct and does not include any error checking or handling of potential exceptions.\n\nIt also assumes that the input is given in the format"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given N positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_N.\nFor a non-negative integer m, let f(m) = (m\\ mod\\ a_1) + (m\\ mod\\ a_2) + ... + (m\\ mod\\ a_N).\nHere, X\\ mod\\ Y denotes the remainder of the division of X by Y.\nFind the maximum value of f.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 3000\n - 2 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum value of f.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n3 4 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n10\n\nf(11) = (11\\ mod\\ 3) + (11\\ mod\\ 4) + (11\\ mod\\ 6) = 10 is the maximum value of f.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
