He has just detected that a group of pine trees and aspens have started to share the same space. Before, there was a clear line between the species.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unusual, but Ewan is a bit curious about how this will evolve in the future. To track it, he wants to know how much of the area is covered by both species right now.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with a single line with two integers $P$ and $A$: the number of pine trees and aspens, respectively. Then follow $P + A$ lines, one line for each tree. The first $P$ of these lines contain locations for the pine trees, and the remaining $A$ lines contain locations for the aspens.\n\nEach tree is represented by two real numbers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$, representing the location of the tree on a 2D map in metres.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the area covered by both species in square metres. Your answer must have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-3}$.\n\nA point is covered by a species if it is at the edge of or inside a triangle made by three distinct trees of that species.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $0 \\leq P, A \\leq 1000$\n - $0.0 \\leq x_ i, y_ i \\leq 1000.0$\n - $0.2 < |x_ i-x_ j|+|y_ i-y_ j|$ for all $0 \\leq i < j < P + A$\n - Real numbers in the input will have at most $8$ digits after the decimal point\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3\n0.0 6.0\n6.0 0.0\n6.0 6.0\n4.0 4.0\n10.0 4.0\n4.0 10.0\nSample Output:\n4.0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
