Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one \u2014 into b pieces.\n\nIvan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. \n\nTo make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.\n\nHelp Ivan to calculate this number x!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100, 2 \u2264 n \u2264 a + b) \u2014 the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 7 10\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.\n\nIn the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
