They need to solve the following problem to pass the IT exam.\n\nYou've got string s = s_1s_2... s_{n} (n is the length of the string), consisting only of characters \".\" and \"#\" and m queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} < r_{i} \u2264 n). The answer to the query l_{i}, r_{i} is the number of such integers i (l_{i} \u2264 i < r_{i}), that s_{i} = s_{i} + 1.\n\nIlya the Lion wants to help his friends but is there anyone to help him? Help Ilya, solve the problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains string s of length n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that the given string only consists of characters \".\" and \"#\".\n\nThe next line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains the description of the corresponding query. The i-th line contains integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} < r_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint m integers \u2014 the answers to the queries in the order in which they are given in the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n......\n4\n3 4\n2 3\n1 6\n2 6\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n5\n4\n\nInput\n#..###\n5\n1 3\n5 6\n1 5\n3 6\n3 4\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n2\n2\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
