The altitude of coordinates (X, Y) is max(H - |X - C_X| - |Y - C_Y|, 0).  \nAoki, an explorer, conducted a survey to identify the center coordinates and height of this pyramid. As a result, he obtained the following information:  \n - C_X, C_Y was integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive), and H was an integer not less than 1.  \n - Additionally, he obtained N pieces of information. The i-th of them is: \"the altitude of point (x_i, y_i) is h_i.\"  \nThis was enough to identify the center coordinates and the height of the pyramid. Find these values with the clues above.  \n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n - x_i and y_i are integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive).\n - h_i is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).\n - The N coordinates (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), ..., (x_N, y_N) are all different.\n - The center coordinates and the height of the pyramid can be uniquely identified.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:  \nN\nx_1 y_1 h_1\nx_2 y_2 h_2\nx_3 y_3 h_3\n:\nx_N y_N h_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint values C_X, C_Y and H representing the center coordinates and the height of the pyramid in one line, with spaces in between.  \n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n2 3 5\n2 1 5\n1 2 5\n3 2 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2 2 6\n\nIn this case, the center coordinates and the height can be identified as (2, 2) and 6.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
