The maximum of these is the largest possible area.\n\nThis solution assumes that the order in which the integers are multiplied together doesn't matter. If the order does matter (i.e., if the problem requires that Kornislav must use the integers in a specific order), the problem becomes much more complicated.\n\nThis solution", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is asking us to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be enclosed by 4 given sides. The maximum area of a rectangle is obtained by multiplying the two larger numbers. Since we are looking for the largest area, we need to find the two larger numbers among the four given integers. This is exactly what the Python code does. It takes four integers as input, then finds the maximum product of the four possible pairs of these numbers (A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D) and prints this as the maximum possible area.\n\nThis code works because the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width,", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads four integers A, B, C, and D. It then calculates the six possible areas of the rectangle that can be formed by the turtle's walk: A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, and C*D. The largest of these areas is then printed as the output. This is done using the built-in Python function max(), which returns the maximum value of the input values.", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program takes four inputs A, B, C, and D. It then finds the maximum area of the rectangle that can be formed by using these four numbers. The maximum area can be found by multiplying the two largest numbers since the rectangle's area is the product of its two sides. The sides of the rectangle are the four inputs A, B, C, and D.\n\nThe four pairs of numbers are (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), and (C, D). By multiplying each pair of numbers, the program finds the maximum area. The maximum area is then printed as the output.\n\nThis solution assumes that", "A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max(A*B, A*C, A*D, B*C, B*D, C*D))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the concept of maximum area. \n\nThe four integers A, B, C, D are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length * width. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the maximum area that can be obtained by the four integers A, B, C, D. This can be done by simply multiplying each pair of integers and taking the maximum. This is done by using the max function in python.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(1) because it only involves a constant number of operations.\n\nThe space complexity of the solution is O(1) because it only uses"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nKornislav the turtle never has anything interesting to do. Since he\u2019s going to live for three hundred years, he keeps trying to find way to kill time. This weekend he started playing \"enclose the largest rectangle\".\n\nTo start with, Kornislav needs four positive integers. He tries to enclose a rectangle by moving in one direction, then turning 90 degrees, then walking in the new direction etc. Kornislav makes a total of three 90-degree turns and walks four segments.\n\nWhen walking in some direction, the number of steps he takes must be equal to one of the four chosen integers and each integer must be used exactly once. Depending on the order in which Kornislav uses the integers, his walk will make various shapes, some of which don\u2019t contain enclosed rectangles. Write a program that calculates the largest rectangle the turtle can enclose with its walk.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains four positive integers $A, B, C$ and $D~ (0 < A, B, C, D < 100)$, the four chosen integers.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the largest area.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1 2 3 4\nSample Output:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
