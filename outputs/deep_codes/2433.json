To assemble a hamburger you need two buns and a beef patty. To assemble a chicken burger you need two buns and a chicken cutlet. \n\nYou have $b$ buns, $p$ beef patties and $f$ chicken cutlets in your restaurant. You can sell one hamburger for $h$ dollars and one chicken burger for $c$ dollars. Calculate the maximum profit you can achieve.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2013 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains three integers $b$, $p$ and $f$ ($1 \\le b, ~p, ~f \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of buns, beef patties and chicken cutlets in your restaurant.\n\nThe second line of each query contains two integers $h$ and $c$ ($1 \\le h, ~c \\le 100$) \u2014 the hamburger and chicken burger prices in your restaurant.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query print one integer \u2014 the maximum profit you can achieve.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n15 2 3\n5 10\n7 5 2\n10 12\n1 100 100\n100 100\n\nOutput\n40\n34\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first query you have to sell two hamburgers and three chicken burgers. Your income is $2 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 10 = 40$.\n\nIn second query you have to ell one hamburgers and two chicken burgers. Your income is $1 \\cdot 10 + 2 \\cdot 12 = 34$.\n\nIn third query you can not create any type of burgers because because you have only one bun. So your income is zero.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
