Every plant on the planet can be described by three numbers: the $x$-coordinates $L$ and $R$ of the two stems, and the height $H$ at which the stems are connected. The following image depicts a plant with $L=2$, $R=5$ and $H=4$.\n\nEvery day a new plant grows on the planet. The plant that grows on day $1$ is of height $1$, and every subsequent plant is one higher than the previous one.\n\nWhen a stem of a new plant intersects the horizontal segment of another plant, a small flower grows (if one was not there already). If segments merely touch in a point, a flower will not grow there.\n\nThe following images are a visualization of the first sample input. \u2003  \u2003  \u2003 \n\nWrite a program that, given the coordinates of all plants, calculates the number of new flower every day.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100000$), the number of days.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $L$ and $R$ ($1 \\le L < R \\le 100000$). The $i$\u2019th of these lines describes the coordinates of the plant that grows on day $i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $N$ lines, the number of new flowers after each plant grows.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 4\n3 7\n1 6\n2 6\nSample Output:\n0\n1\n1\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
