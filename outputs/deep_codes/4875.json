(Can you speak pig latin?) If you can\u2019t, here are the rules:\n - If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of the word, then add ay to the end of the word. Examples: pig $\\to $ igpay, there$\\to $ erethay.\n - If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), simply add yay to the end of the word. For this problem, y is always a vowel. Examples: and $\\to $ andyay, ordinary$\\to $ ordinaryyay.\n\nAlthough there are many variants of Pig Latin (such as Kedelkloppersprook in Germany), for this problem we will always use the rules described above.\n\nA friend of yours was frustrated with everyone writing in Pig Latin and has asked you to write a program to translate to Pig Latin for him. Ouldway youyay ebay osay indkay otay oday ityay? (Would you be so kind to do it?)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of $1$ to $4000$ lines, ending at end of file.

Every word contains at least one vowel, and adjacent words are separated by a single space. No punctuation or special characters will appear in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nYour program should output the text translated to Pig Latin using the rules described above.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\ni cant speak pig latin\nSample Output:\niyay antcay eakspay igpay atinlay\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
