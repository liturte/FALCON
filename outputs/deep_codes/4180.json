This is simply the difference between the price of the product and 1000-yen bills. We input the price of the product using `input()`, convert it to an integer using `int()`, and subtract it from 1000 to get the change. We print the result.\n\nFor example, if the price of the product is 1900 yen, we subtract 1900 from 1000 to get the change of 100 yen.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be a valid integer between 1 and 10000. If the input could be invalid, you should add error checking to handle that case.", "print(1000 - int(input()))\n\n\nThis Python program will read an integer input N from the standard input, calculate the change by subtracting N from 1000, and print the result.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input will always be in the range [1, 10000] as specified in the problem statement. If the input can be outside this range, you should add appropriate error checking code to handle this case.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that we are always using 1000-yen bills.
