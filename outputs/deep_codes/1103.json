He took n cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding 8 written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 8 in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then 1 from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are c_{k} cards with number k on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers $i \\in [ 1,8 ], j \\in [ 1,8 ]$ the condition |c_{i} - c_{j}| \u2264 1 must hold.  if there is at least one card with number x on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number x in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence [1, 1, 2, 2] satisfies this condition while the subsequence [1, 2, 2, 1] doesn't. Note that [1, 1, 2, 2] doesn't satisfy the first condition. \n\nPlease help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cards in Vladik's sequence.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of n positive integers not exceeding 8\u00a0\u2014 the description of Vladik's sequence.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer\u00a0\u2014 the length of the longest subsequence of Vladik's sequence that satisfies both conditions.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n8\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n8\nInput\n24\n1 8 1 2 8 2 3 8 3 4 8 4 5 8 5 6 8 6 7 8 7 8 8 8\n\nOutput\n17\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample all the numbers written on the cards are equal, so you can't take more than one card, otherwise you'll violate the first condition.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
