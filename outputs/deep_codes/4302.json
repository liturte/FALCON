The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that we can press the button of size A twice and the button of size B once to get the maximum number of coins. This is because pressing the button of size A twice will give us A coins, and pressing the button of size B once will give us B coins. So, the maximum number of coins we can get is A + B.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input will always", "def max_coins(a, b):\n    return a*2 + b*2\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max_coins(a, b))\n\n\nThis code takes two inputs A and B, and calculates the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing the button twice. It does this by multiplying A and B by 2 and adding the results. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be two integers between 3 and 20. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be needed.", "def max_coins(a, b):\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    return a + a + b\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max_coins(a, b))\n\n\nThis code works by first defining a function `max_coins` that calculates the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing the buttons. This function takes two arguments: the sizes of the buttons. It first ensures that `a` is the larger of the two sizes, and then calculates the maximum number of coins by adding `a` to itself twice, and then adding `b`.\n\nThe main part of the code reads the sizes of the buttons from the input, converts them to integers, and calls `max_coins` with these sizes. The result is printed to the output.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be in the correct format and that the values will be within the constraints. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.", "def max_coins(a, b):\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    return a * 2 + b\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max_coins(a, b))\n\n\nThis code firstly checks if `a` is less than `b` and swaps them if `a` is less than `b`. Then it returns the sum of `a` multiplied by 2 and `b`. This is because pressing the button of size `a` twice will give you `a` coins and the size of the button decreases by 1 each time, so `a` coins are obtained. Then the button of size `b` is pressed once, and `b` coins are obtained. The maximum number of coins you can get is thus the sum of these two quantities. The inputs are read from the standard input and the result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis code is written in Python and it uses the built-in `map` function to read the two integers from the standard input. The `print` function is used to output the result. The `if` statement is used to swap `a` and `b` if `a` is less than `b`. The `*` operator is used to multiply `a` by 2 and the", "def max_coins(A, B):\n    return max(A + B, A * (A + 1) // 2, B * (B + 1) // 2)\n\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(max_coins(A, B))\n\nThis code defines a function `max_coins` that calculates the maximum number of coins you can get. It uses the formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, to calculate the maximum number of coins you can get by pressing the same button twice. The function then returns the maximum of these three values. The input is read from standard input and passed to the `max_coins` function, the result is printed to standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the problem statement is correct and does not contain any errors or omissions.
