It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that $n$ is even (i.e. divisible by $2$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"NO\" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or \"YES\" in the first line and any suitable array $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\n2 4 1 5\nNO\nYES\n2 4 6 8 1 3 5 11\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
