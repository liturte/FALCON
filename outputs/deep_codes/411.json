Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths \u2013 from a base to its assigned spaceship \u2013 do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 \u2264 R, B \u2264 10). For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| \u2264 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n2 2\n3 1\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.\n\nFor the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
