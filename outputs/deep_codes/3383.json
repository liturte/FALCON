In what order? The only way to ensure that you are making the right decisions is to approach the problem systematically.\n\nTherefore, you examine each of the $k$ flavours and estimate that the tastiness of a scoop of the $i$th flavour is $t_ i$. However, you are aware that some flavours complement each other, resulting in a tastiness greater than the sum of the individual flavours, whereas others just do not go very well together. Therefore, you have estimated the additional tastiness experienced whenever a scoop of one flavour is directly on top of a scoop of another, and what happens when you put two scoops of the same flavour on top of each other. The additional tastiness experienced whenever flavour $i$ is on top of flavour $j$ is $u_{i,j}$. Of course, you would like to maximize the total tastiness of your ice cream, but there are two problems.\n\nFirstly, your stomach is, regrettably, finite. Therefore, you do not want to order more that $n$ scoops. You may order fewer scoops, if this is better.\n\nSecondly, ice cream isn\u2019t free. Each scoop costs $a$ gold coins, and the cone costs $b$ gold coins (regardless of the number of scoops of ice cream you buy).\n\nYou would like to find the maximum possible tastiness per gold coin ratio.

The $j$th number on the $i$th line is the additional tastiness $u_{i,j}$ ($-200 \\leq u_{i,j} \\leq 200$).\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is impossible to get an ice cream with positive tastiness, display $0$.\n\nOtherwise, display the largest possible value of the quotient of the tastiness and the cost of an ice cream.", "QUESTION:\nIce cream is a difficult topic.
