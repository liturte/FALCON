The i-th edge connects Vertex A_i and B_i (1 \\leq A_i,B_i \\leq N).\nNow, each vertex is painted black with probability 1/2 and white with probability 1/2, which is chosen independently from other vertices. Then, let S be the smallest subtree (connected subgraph) of T containing all the vertices painted black. (If no vertex is painted black, S is the empty graph.)\nLet the holeyness of S be the number of white vertices contained in S. Find the expected holeyness of S.\nSince the answer is a rational number, we ask you to print it \\bmod 10^9+7, as described in Notes.\n\n-----Notes-----\nWhen you print a rational number, first write it as a fraction \\frac{y}{x}, where x, y are integers, and x is not divisible by 10^9 + 7\n(under the constraints of the problem, such representation is always possible).\nThen, you need to print the only integer z between 0 and 10^9 + 6, inclusive, that satisfies xz \\equiv y \\pmod{10^9 + 7}.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i,B_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is a tree.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 B_1\n:\nA_{N-1} B_{N-1}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the expected holeyness of S, \\bmod 10^9+7.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n125000001\n\nIf the vertices 1, 2, 3 are painted black, white, black, respectively, the holeyness of S is 1.\nOtherwise, the holeyness is 0, so the expected holeyness is 1/8.\nSince 8 \\times 125000001 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10^9+7}, we should print 125000001.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
