There are the following 8 queries:  \"1 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 3 becomes online.  \"2 4\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print \"NO\".  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print \"YES\".  \"1 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3.  \"1 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given k = 2 so only two friends can be displayed. Limak has worse relation with friend 1 than with other two online friends (t_1 < t_2, t_3) so friend 1 won't be displayed  \"2 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"NO\".  \"2 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"YES\".  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"YES\".\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
