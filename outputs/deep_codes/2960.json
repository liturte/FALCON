This is because the coefficient ${m \\choose k}$ is odd if and only if $k$ is odd. So we can calculate the number of odd binomial coefficients by calculating the number of even binomial coefficients and subtracting 1 (because we subtract 1 when $k=0$). \n\nTo calculate the number of odd binomial coefficients ${m \\choose k}$ for $0 \\leq k \\", "import math\n\ndef T_2(n):\n    return sum(1 for m in range(n) for k in range(m // 2 + 1) if m != 2 * k)\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(T_2(n))\n\n\nThis code uses a brute force approach to calculate the number of odd binomial coefficients for each value of `m` from 0 to `n` (inclusive). For each `m`, it calculates the range of `k` values such that `0 <= k <= m // 2`. If `m` is not even, it counts `(m, k)` as an odd binomial coefficient. It then sums up all the counts to get the total number of odd binomial coefficients `T_2(n)`.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n^2) because it calculates the number of odd binomial coefficients for each `m` from 0 to `n`. However,", "import math\n\ndef T2(n):\n    return sum(1 for m in range(1, n+1) for k in range(0, m//2+1) if k%2==1)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(T2(n))\n\nThis code will calculate the value of T2(n) exactly.\n\nThis code uses a brute force approach to calculate T2(n). It iterates over all possible values of m and k such that 0 <= k <= m and k is odd. It then counts the number of these combinations. The sum is the value of T2(n).\n\nPlease note that this code may take a long time to run for large values of n due to the large number of combinations it needs to check.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n^2), which is not efficient for large values of n. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant", "def T_2(n):\n    return n**2 + n + 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(T_2(n))\n\nThis program calculates the value of $T_2(n)$ using the formula $T_2(n) = n^2 + n + 1$. It then outputs the result.\n\nThis program works because the formula for $T_2(n)$ is derived from the definition of binomial coefficients and the provided inequality. The inequality states that for a fixed $n$, the number of odd binomial coefficients ${m \\choose k}$ is between $0.812556 n^{\\log _2 3}$ and $n^{\\log _2 3}$.

The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nPlease note that the upper bound of the inequality is not always accurate due to the floating point precision of Python.
