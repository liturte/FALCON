You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of q possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The i-th operation is described by a string a_{i} of length two and a string b_{i} of length one. No two of q possible operations have the same string a_{i}.\n\nWhen Limak has a string s he can perform the i-th operation on s if the first two letters of s match a two-letter string a_{i}.

There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows:   \"cab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"cca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"eea\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\" \n\nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\".\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
