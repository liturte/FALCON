In order to get a good mark, Vasya needs to guess the matrix that the teacher has constructed!\n\nVasya knows that the matrix consists of n rows and m columns. For each row, he knows the xor (bitwise excluding or) of the elements in this row. The sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denotes the xor of elements in rows with indices 1, 2, ..., n, respectively. Similarly, for each column, he knows the xor of the elements in this column. The sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} denotes the xor of elements in columns with indices 1, 2, ..., m, respectively.\n\nHelp Vasya! Find a matrix satisfying the given constraints or tell him that there is no suitable matrix.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m\u00a0(2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \u2014 the dimensions of the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}\u00a0(0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), where a_{i} is the xor of all elements in row i.\n\nThe third line contains m numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}\u00a0(0 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10^9), where b_{i} is the xor of all elements in column i.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no matrix satisfying the given constraints in the first line, output \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, on the first line output \"YES\", and then n rows of m numbers in each c_{i}1, c_{i}2, ... , c_{im}\u00a0(0 \u2264 c_{ij} \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 the description of the matrix.\n\nIf there are several suitable matrices, it is allowed to print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n2 9\n5 3 13\n\nOutput\nYES\n3 4 5\n6 7 8\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 7 6\n2 15 12\n\nOutput\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
