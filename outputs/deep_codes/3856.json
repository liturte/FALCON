Technologies have leaped forward since the last meeting, cameras with timer appeared and now it is not obligatory for one of the friends to stand with a camera, and, thus, being absent on the photo.\n\nSimply speaking, the process of photographing can be described as follows. Each friend occupies a rectangle of pixels on the photo: the i-th of them in a standing state occupies a w_{i} pixels wide and a h_{i} pixels high rectangle. But also, each person can lie down for the photo, and then he will occupy a h_{i} pixels wide and a w_{i} pixels high rectangle.\n\nThe total photo will have size W \u00d7 H, where W is the total width of all the people rectangles, and H is the maximum of the heights. The friends want to determine what minimum area the group photo can they obtain if no more than n / 2 of them can lie on the ground (it would be strange if more than n / 2 gentlemen lie on the ground together, isn't it?..)\n\nHelp them to achieve this goal.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe next n lines have two integers w_{i}, h_{i} (1 \u2264 w_{i}, h_{i} \u2264 1000) each, representing the size of the rectangle, corresponding to the i-th friend.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer equal to the minimum possible area of the photo containing all friends if no more than n / 2 of them can lie on the ground.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n10 1\n20 2\n30 3\n\nOutput\n180\n\nInput\n3\n3 1\n2 2\n4 3\n\nOutput\n21\n\nInput\n1\n5 10\n\nOutput\n50\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
