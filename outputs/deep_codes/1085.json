The function dfs is a helper function that performs the operations as described in the question. The main function min_operations loops through all possible values of K from 2 to the square root of N, and for each K, it calls dfs to count the number of operations required to reduce N to 1.

The function `f` is a recursive function that calculates the number of steps required to reduce the number `N` to 1, using the operation of dividing or subtracting by `K`. The function `solve` iterates over all possible values of `K` from 2 to `N`, and for each `K`, it calls the function `f` to", "def solve(n):\n    i = 2\n    count = 0\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            n //= i\n            count += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\n\nThis code uses a while loop to iterate from 2 to sqrt(N) to check for factors of N. If the number is not a factor, it increments the factor by 1. If the number is a factor, it divides N by the factor and increments the count of factors. If the remaining number is greater than 1, it increments the count of factors by 1. Finally, it returns the count of factors.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the fact that a number N can be factored into its prime factors. If N is not a prime number, it will have at least one prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(N).\n\"\"\"", "from sys import stdin\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve(n):\n    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n    dp[1] = 1\n    dp[2] = 1\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            dp[i] = dp[i//2] + 1\n        else:\n            dp[i] = dp[(i+1)//2] + 1\n    return dp[n]\n\nn = int(stdin.readline().strip())\nprint(solve(n))\n\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp array stores the minimum number of operations required to make N become 1 for each number from 1 to N. The dp[i] is calculated based on dp[i//2] if i is even, and dp[(i+1)//2] if i is odd. This is because when i is even, we", "def solve(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n //= i\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses the prime factorization of the given number N. It starts from the smallest prime number 2 and checks if it divides N. If it does, it increments the count and divides N by the prime number. If it doesn't, it increments the prime number. The process continues until the square of the prime number is greater than N. If N is greater than 1 after this process, it means that N is a prime number and we increment the count. The function returns the count which is the number of choices of K.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input using the `input()` function and converted to an integer using the `"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is a positive integer N.\nWe will choose an integer K between 2 and N (inclusive), then we will repeat the operation below until N becomes less than K.\n - Operation: if K divides N, replace N with N/K; otherwise, replace N with N-K.\nIn how many choices of K will N become 1 in the end?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^{12}\n - N is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of choices of K in which N becomes 1 in the end.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThere are three choices of K in which N becomes 1 in the end: 2, 5, and 6.\nIn each of these choices, N will change as follows:\n - When K=2: 6 \\to 3 \\to 1\n - When K=5: 6 \\to 1\n - When K=6: 6 \\to 1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
