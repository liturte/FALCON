His friend however claimed that summer is always too short in Galcary so there\u2019s nothing to complain about.\n\nYraglac doesn\u2019t believe his friend. So he decides to look up the historical weather report for the past $n$ years to figure out when it usually starts snowing. For each year in the past $n$ years, the historical weather report records $d_ i$, the number of days between the end of summer and the first day of snow on the $i^\\textrm {th}$ year. You may assume it never snows during summer in Galcary, as that would be absurd.\n\nGiven the historical data, Yraglac would like to know the number of consecutive years right before the current year with a larger gap between the end of summer and the first day of snow. More formally, suppose the current year is $m$. Then he\u2019d like to determine the largest integer $k$ for which $d_{m-1}, d_{m-2},\\ldots ,d_{m-k}> d_ m$, or determine that it had never snowed this early in the last $n$ years.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $d_ m$. It is guaranteed that $1\\leq n\\leq 100$ and $0\\leq d_ m\\leq 100$.\n\nThe next line of the input contains $n$ integers. The $i^\\textrm {th}$ integer denotes $d_{m-i}$. It is guaranteed that $0\\leq d_{m-i}\\leq 100$.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there exists an integer $k$ for which $d_{m-k}\\leq d_ m$, print \u201cIt hadn\u2019t snowed this early in $k$ years!\u201d (without quotes). Otherwise, print \u201cIt had never snowed this early!\u201d (without quotes).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 2\n3 3 3 2\nSample Output 1:\nIt hadn't snowed this early in 3 years!\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 10\n0 100\nSample Output 2:\nIt hadn't snowed this early in 0 years!\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
