{"1": {"code": ["x = int(input())\nprint(int(''.join(sorted(str(x), reverse=True))))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code first takes the input x and converts it to a string. It then sorts the digits of the string in descending order (from the highest digit to the lowest digit) and joins them back together into a single string. This string is then converted back into an integer and printed out.\n\nIf x is 521, the sorted string of digits will be '5', '2', '1'. The sorted string in reverse order is '5', '2', '1'. Joining them together gives '521', which is the original number.\n\nIf x is 48, the sorted string of digits will be '8', '4'. The sorted string in reverse order is '8', '4'. Joining them together gives '84', which is the original number.\n\nIf x is 100, the sorted string of digits will be '1', '0', '0'. The sorted string in reverse order is '0', '0', '1'. Joining them together gives '001', which is the original number. But this is not a valid integer, so the code should return '100", "def max_sum_digits(n):\n    if n < 10:\n        return n\n    else:\n        digits = list(map(int, str(n)))\n        digits.sort()\n        if digits[0] != 1:\n            return int(''.join(map(str, digits[::-1])))\n        else:\n            for i in range(1, len(digits)):\n                if digits[i] != 0:\n                    digits[0], digits[i] = digits[i], digits[0]\n                    break\n            return int(''.join(map(str, digits[::-1])))\n\nprint(max_sum_digits(int(input())))\n\n\nThis program works by first checking if the number is less than 10. If it is, the program returns the number itself. If the number is 10 or greater, the program converts the number to a list of its digits, sorts the digits in ascending order, and then checks if the smallest digit is not 1. If the smallest digit is not 1, the program returns the number formed by reversing the digits. If the smallest digit is 1, the program replaces", "x = int(input().strip())\nprint(int(''.join(sorted(str(x))[::-1])) if x % 10 != 9 else x-1)\n\n\nThis code works by taking the input integer x. It then sorts the digits of x in descending order and joins them together into a string. If the last digit of x is not 9, it simply converts this string back to an integer and prints it. If the last digit of x is 9, it subtracts 1 from x and prints the result. This is because the maximum sum of digits for an integer that ends in 9 is obtained by replacing the 9 with 8 and then adding 1 to the result.\n\nThis solution works because it always tries to maximize the sum of digits by replacing the smallest digits with the largest possible digits (9 to 0), and it does this until it can't get any better result.\n\nFor example, for x = 521, the digits are sorted in descending order to be [5, 2, 1]. The sum of digits is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Since the last digit of x is 1, we can't get a better result by replacing it with 9 (which would give", "def max_digit_sum(n):\n    if n < 10:\n        return n\n    if n % 9 == 0:\n        return int('9' + '0' * ((n // 9) - 1))\n    else:\n        return int(str(n % 9) + '0' * (n // 9))\n\nx = int(input().strip())\nprint(max_digit_sum(x))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution works by converting the number to a sum of its digits. If the number is divisible by 9, it will be possible to make the sum of its digits as large as possible by repeating 9. If the number is not divisible by 9, the largest possible sum will be obtained by using the remainder of the division by 9 as the last digit and repeating 0s as many times as the integer division of the number by 9. The solution then returns the largest possible number that does not exceed x.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input will be a positive integer. If there is a possibility of negative input, it should be handled accordingly.", "def max_sum_digits(x):\n    if x < 10:\n        return x\n    else:\n        digits = [int(d) for d in str(x)]\n        max_digit = max(digits)\n        max_sum = sum(digits) - max_digit + 9 * (len(digits) - 1)\n        if max_sum > x:\n            return max_sum - 10 + max(digits[:-1]) + 1\n        else:\n            return max_sum\n\nx = int(input())\nprint(max_sum_digits(x))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code first checks if x is less than 10. If it is, the function simply returns x. Otherwise, it converts x to a list of its digits, calculates the maximum sum of digits by subtracting the max digit and adding 9 times the number of digits minus 1. It then checks if the calculated maximum sum of digits is greater than x. If it is, it subtracts 10 from the max sum and adds the maximum digit of the digits excluding the max digit plus 1.
