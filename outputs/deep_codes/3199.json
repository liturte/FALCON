A branch of the bank can be visualized in a plane, vaults being points in the plane. Mirko\u2019s branch contains exactly $L\\cdot (A+1+B)$ vaults, so that each point with integer coordinates inside the rectangle with corners $(1, -A)$ and $(L, B)$ contains one vault.\n\nThe vaults are watched by two guards\u2014one at $(0, -A)$, the other at $(0, B)$. A guard can see a vault if there are no other vaults on the line segment connecting them.\n\nA vault is not secure if neither guard can see it, secure if only one guard can see it and super-secure if both guards can see it. Given $A$, $B$ and $L$, output the number of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains integers $A$ and $B$ separated by a space ($1 \\leq A \\leq 2000, 1 \\leq B \\leq 2000$). The second line contains the integer $L$ ($1 \\leq L \\leq 1000000000$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput on three separate lines the numbers of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 1\n3\nSample Output 1:\n2\n2\n5\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n4\nSample Output 2:\n0\n16\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
