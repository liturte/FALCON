However, they did not know that all applicants must pass an entrance exam. The exam consists of $N$ questions, each with three possible answers: A, B and C.\n\nUnfortunately, they couldn\u2019t tell a bird from a whale so they are trying to guess the correct answers. Each of the three boys has a theory of what set of answers will work best:\n\nAdrian claims that the best sequence is: A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C ...\n\nBruno is convinced that this is better: B, A, B, C, B, A, B, C, B, A, B, C ...\n\nGoran laughs at them and will use this sequence: C, C, A, A, B, B, C, C, A, A, B, B ...\n\nWrite a program that, given the correct answers to the exam, determines who of the three was right \u2013 whose sequence contains the most correct answers.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100$), the number of questions on the exam.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $N$ letters \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019. These are, in order, the correct answers to the questions in the exam.\n\n-----Output-----\nOn the first line, output $M$, the largest number of correct answers one of the three boys gets.\n\nAfter that, output the names of the boys (in alphabetical order) whose sequences result in $M$ correct answers.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\nBAACC\nSample Output:\n3\nBruno\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
