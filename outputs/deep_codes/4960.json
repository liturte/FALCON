Slavko is not the brightest when it comes to math, so he is starting out converting binary numerals to octal. The algorithm Slavko uses is this:\n - Pad the binary numeral with zeros on the left until the number of digits is divisible by three.\n - Group adjacent binary digits into groups of $3$ digits.\n - Replace each group of binary digits with the corresponding octal digit (as in Table\u00a01).\n\n000\n\n0\n\n001\n\n1\n\n010\n\n2\n\n011\n\n3\n\n100\n\n4\n\n101\n\n5\n\n110\n\n6\n\n111\n\n7Table 1: Binary to octal \n\nWrite a program that converts a binary numeral to octal so that Slavko can verify his results.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a binary numeral.
