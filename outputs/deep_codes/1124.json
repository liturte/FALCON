Otherwise, replace each card on which X is written with a card on which X-x is written, then go back to step 1.\nUnder the constraints in this problem, it can be proved that the procedure will eventually terminate. Find the number written on all of Snuke's cards after the procedure.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}\n - 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 \\cdots a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number written on all of Snuke's cards after the procedure.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n2 6 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\n - At the beginning of the procedure, the numbers written on Snuke's cards are (2,6,6).\n - Since x=2 and X=6, he replaces each card on which 6 is written with a card on which 4 is written.\n - Now, the numbers written on Snuke's cards are (2,4,4).\n - Since x=2 and X=4, he replaces each card on which 4 is written with a card on which 2 is written.\n - Now, the numbers written on Snuke's cards are (2,2,2).\n - Since x=2 and X=2, he terminates the procedure.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
