An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $n - 1$ edges.\n\nYour task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex $1$ to any other vertex is at most $2$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $n - 1$ lines contain edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $u_i, v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex $1$ to any other vertex at most $2$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n5 7\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n1 7\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\n3 7\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe tree corresponding to the first example: [Image] The answer is $2$, some of the possible answers are the following: $[(1, 5), (1, 6)]$, $[(1, 4), (1, 7)]$, $[(1, 6), (1, 7)]$.\n\nThe tree corresponding to the second example: [Image] The answer is $0$.\n\nThe tree corresponding to the third example: [Image] The answer is $1$, only one possible way to reach it is to add the edge $(1, 3)$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
