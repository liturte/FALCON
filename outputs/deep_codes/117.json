Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\\ \\mathrm{cm} south and y\\ \\mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).\nThere are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).\nWhat is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9  (inclusive).\n - 1 \\leq N, M \\leq 1000\n - A_i < B_i\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq N)\n - E_j < F_j\\ (1 \\leq j \\leq M)\n - The point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nA_1 B_1 C_1\n:\nA_N B_N C_N\nD_1 E_1 F_1\n:\nD_M E_M F_M\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the area of the region the cow can reach is infinite, print INF; otherwise, print an integer representing the area in \\mathrm{cm^2}.\n(Under the constraints, it can be proved that the area of the region is always an integer if it is not infinite.)\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 6\n1 2 0\n0 1 1\n0 2 2\n-3 4 -1\n-2 6 3\n1 0 1\n0 1 2\n2 0 2\n-1 -4 5\n3 -2 4\n1 2 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n13\n\nThe area of the region the cow can reach is 13\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
