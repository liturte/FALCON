{"3720": {"code": ["def who_wins(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"Vasya\"\n    else:\n        return \"Petya\"\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis is a simple math problem. The winner is determined by the number of distinct prime factors of n. If the number of prime factors is odd, Vasya wins. If the number of prime factors is even, Petya wins. This is because each player can choose the number x and all of its powers at the next turns, and this will prevent the opponent from choosing any other number. Therefore, the number of distinct prime factors determines the winner.\n\nFor example, if n = 100", "def who_wins(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return \"Vasya\"\n    else:\n        return \"Petya\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe optimal strategy for Vasya is to choose 2^k for the smallest possible k such that 2^k \u2264 n. This ensures that in the next turn, Petya has no option but to choose the remaining number.\n\nFor Petya, the optimal strategy is to choose 2^(k-1) for the smallest possible k such that 2^k \u2264 n. This ensures that in the next turn, Vasya has", "def who_wins(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"Vasya\"\n    else:\n        return \"Petya\"\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe \"powers\" game is a two-player game where each player takes turns to choose an integer from a list. The rule is that once a number is chosen, all its powers are also forbidden to be chosen in the next turns. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., his turn results in a game where he cannot choose any number) loses.\n\nIf n = 1, the winner is \"Vasya\". If n > 1, the winner is \"Pety", "def who_wins(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"Vasya\"\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return \"Petya\"\n    else:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            return \"Vasya\"\n        else:\n            return \"Petya\"\n\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the player who cannot make a move loses. If n is 1, the player who chooses 1 wins immediately. If n is less than or equal to 3, the player who chooses any of these numbers wins. Otherwise, if n is even, Vasya can choose 2 and win", "def who_wins(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"Vasya\"\n    else:\n        return \"Petya\"\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(who_wins(n))\n\nExplanation:\nThe game \"powers\" is a perfect game of Nim, a mathematical game theory concept. The rules of the game are that the player who cannot make a move loses. In this case, the player who cannot make a move (i.e., chooses a number with a power that is already chosen) loses.\n\nThe winning strategy in this game is simple: if n is a power of 2"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nVasya and Petya wrote down all integers from 1 to n to play the \"powers\" game (n can be quite large; however, Vasya and Petya are not confused by this fact).\n\nPlayers choose numbers in turn (Vasya chooses first). If some number x is chosen at the current turn, it is forbidden to choose x or all of its other positive integer powers (that is, x^2, x^3, ...) at the next turns. For instance, if the number 9 is chosen at the first turn, one cannot choose 9 or 81 later, while it is still allowed to choose 3 or 27. The one who cannot make a move loses.\n\nWho wins if both Vasya and Petya play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the name of the winner \u2014 \"Vasya\" or \"Petya\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\nVasya\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\nPetya\n\nInput\n8\n\nOutput\nPetya\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Vasya will choose 1 and win immediately.\n\nIn the second sample no matter which number Vasya chooses during his first turn, Petya can choose the remaining number and win.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
