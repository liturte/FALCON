Now the game should be played on an undirected rooted tree of n vertices. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nAlice starts at vertex 1 and Bob starts at vertex x (x \u2260 1). The moves are made in turns, Bob goes first. In one move one can either stay at the current vertex or travel to the neighbouring one.\n\nThe game ends when Alice goes to the same vertex where Bob is standing. Alice wants to minimize the total number of moves and Bob wants to maximize it.\n\nYou should write a program which will determine how many moves will the game last.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and x (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 2 \u2264 x \u2264 n).\n\nEach of the next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n) \u2014 edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the edges form a valid tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the total number of moves Alice and Bob will make.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the tree looks like this:\n\n [Image] \n\nThe red vertex is Alice's starting position, the blue one is Bob's. Bob will make the game run the longest by standing at the vertex 3 during all the game. So here are the moves:\n\nB: stay at vertex 3\n\nA: go to vertex 2\n\nB: stay at vertex 3\n\nA: go to vertex 3\n\nIn the second example the tree looks like this:\n\n [Image] \n\nThe moves in the optimal strategy are:\n\nB: go to vertex 3\n\nA: go to vertex 2\n\nB: go to vertex 4\n\nA: go to vertex 3\n\nB: stay at vertex 4\n\nA: go to vertex 4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
