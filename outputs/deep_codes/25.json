However, if the number of ones is more than the size of the matrix, it's impossible to create a symmetrical matrix and we output -1. Otherwise, we fill the main diagonal and the upper triangle of the matrix with ones.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the matrix is filled from left to right, top to bottom.
