If it does, it prints 'Yes'. If it does not, it prints 'No'. The rotation operation is achieved by concatenating the last character of S to the rest of S, effectively shifting the characters one position to the right.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n^2), where n is the length of S. This is because in the worst case scenario, we need to perform n operations to check if S equals T. The space complexity is O(n), as we store S and T in memory.", "import sys\n\nS = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nT = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ndef rotate(s):\n    return s[-1] + s[:-1]\n\nfor _ in range(len(S)):\n    if S == T:\n        print('Yes')\n        sys.exit(0)\n    S = rotate(S)\n\nprint('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads two strings S and T from standard input. It then rotates S by one character to the right in a loop until S equals T or it has been rotated the same number of times as the length of S. If S equals T at any point, it prints \"Yes\" and exits. If it has checked all rotations without finding a match, it prints \"No\". The function rotate(s) returns the string s rotated by one character to the right.\n\nThis solution is correct because it checks all possible rotations of S to see if they match T. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(\"Yes\" if S == T or S[::-1] == T else \"No\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe Python code above reads in two strings `S` and `T`, and checks if they are the same after a rotation. This is done by comparing the strings `S` and `T` directly and by comparing `S` and the reverse of `T`. If either of these comparisons is true, the strings are the same after rotation, so \"Yes\" is printed. Otherwise, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThe string `S[::-1]` is a way to get the reverse of the string `S` in Python. The `[::-1]` slice means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step `-1` (which means one step backwards).\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to read in the two strings and compare them, and the space complexity is O(n) because it needs to store the two strings.", "import sys\n\nS = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\nT = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n\nif len(S) != len(T):\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    S += S\n    if S.find(T) != -1:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution first checks if the lengths of the strings S and T are equal. If they are not, it prints \"No\" and exits.\n\nIf the lengths are equal, the solution appends S to itself. This is equivalent to performing the rotation operation as described in the problem statement.\n\nThen, it checks if T is a substring of the new string S. If T is a substring of S after the rotation, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input strings S and T are given on separate lines, as per the problem statement.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the solution\nS = \"kyoto\"\nT", "import sys\n\nS = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\nT = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n\ndef rotation(S):\n    return S[-1] + S[:-1]\n\nfor _ in range(len(S)):\n    if S == T:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        sys.exit()\n    S = rotation(S)\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code reads two strings S and T from standard input. It then checks if S equals T after performing rotation operation some number of times. If S equals T after performing rotation, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\". The rotation operation is implemented by the function rotation(S), which returns a string S rotated one position to the right. The loop performs the rotation operation for all positions of S. If S equals T at any position, it prints \"Yes\" and stops. If S does not equal T after all rotations, it prints \"No\".\n\nThe sys.exit() function is used to exit the program immediately after finding a match"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given string S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.\nDetermine if S equals T after rotation.\nThat is, determine if S equals T after the following operation is performed some number of times:\nOperation: Let S = S_1 S_2 ...
