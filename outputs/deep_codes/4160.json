Then it initializes the `balance` to 100 (Takahashi's initial deposit), and the `years` counter to 0. The loop continues until the `balance` is greater than or equal to `X`.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the interest by dividing the current `balance` by 100 (since the interest rate is 1%), and adds this interest to the `balance`. It then increments the `years` counter.\n\nFinally, the code prints the number of years it took for the `balance` to reach `X` or more.\n\nThis code assumes that the interest is compounded annually, and", "import math\nX = int(input())\nbalance = 100\nyears = 0\n\nwhile balance < X:\n    balance = math.floor(balance * 1.01)\n    years += 1\n\nprint(years)\n\nThis code uses a while loop to calculate the balance after each year. The balance is updated by multiplying the current balance by 1.01 (the interest rate) and then using the floor function to discard any fraction of a yen. This is repeated until the balance is equal to or greater than X. The number of years is then printed.\n\nThe math.floor function is used to ensure that the balance is an integer, as per the problem statement. This is because the balance should be an integer number of yen.\n\nThe condition `balance < X` is used to ensure that the loop continues until the balance is at least X.\n\nThe variable `years` is incremented by 1 each time the loop is run, to keep track of the number", "import math\n\nX = int(input())\nbalance = 100\nyears = 0\n\nwhile balance < X:\n    balance = math.floor(balance * 1.01)\n    years += 1\n\nprint(years)\n\n\nThis code uses a while loop to calculate the balance after each year by multiplying the current balance by 1.01 (which represents the interest rate) and then rounding down to the nearest whole number using the math.floor function.

In this case, we are calculating the logarithm base 1.01 of X/100. The result is the number of years it takes for Takahashi's balance to reach X yen or above. The math.ceil function rounds up to the nearest integer, so if the balance doesn't reach exactly X yen, we need to wait an additional year.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the interest rate is 1% (or 0.01 in decimal form). This is a common assumption in many financial calculations. The bank may have a different interest rate, and the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe code also assumes that the balance starts at"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi has a deposit of 100 yen (the currency of Japan) in AtCoder Bank.\nThe bank pays an annual interest rate of 1 % compounded annually.
