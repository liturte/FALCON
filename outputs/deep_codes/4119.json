Put that piece at coordinate x+1 or x-1.\nNote that the coordinates where we initially place the pieces are already regarded as visited.\nFind the minimum number of moves required to achieve the objective.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5\n - -10^5 \\leq X_i \\leq 10^5\n - X_1, X_2, ..., X_M are all different.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nX_1 X_2 ...
