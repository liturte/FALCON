For each letter, it finds all the indices where that letter appears in the string. If the letter appears at least twice,"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIvana won the bet (Zvonko hadn\u2019t foreseen this and suspects that it is due to outside interference) and now Zvonko is waiting for her at the movies. While he is waiting, he is observing messages on a screen above him.\n\nAs Ivana is running late, Zvonko has been looking at the screen for a while and noticed that some messages appeared on the screen more than once. Naturally, he\u2019s been writing down all messages on a piece of paper. He wants to know the length of the longest string that appeared at least twice (appears in two different positions on the paper).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $L~ (1 \\leq L \\leq 200000)$, the length of the string Zvonko wrote down.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $L$ lowercase letter of the English alphabet.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the length of the longest string that appears twice on a single line. If there is no such string, output zero.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n11\nsabcabcfabc\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n18\ntrutrutiktiktappop\nSample Output 2:\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
