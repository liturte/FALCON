You can see that the debts are not organized in a very optimal manner. Let's rearrange them like that: assume that A owes C 20 rubles and B doesn't owe anything to anybody. The debts still mean the same but the total sum of the debts now equals 20 rubles.\n\nThis task is a generalisation of a described example. Imagine that your group of friends has n people and you know the debts between the people. Optimize the given debts without changing their meaning. In other words, finally for each friend the difference between the total money he should give and the total money he should take must be the same.
