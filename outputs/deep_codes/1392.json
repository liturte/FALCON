The map function is used to convert all the digits from 0 to k to strings, which are then used to check if they are in the number. The all function checks if all of these digits are in the number, and the sum function counts the total number of times all digits are in the numbers.\n\nThe code starts by taking the input for the number of elements and the maximum digit, and then takes the elements themselves. It then checks each number to see if it contains all digits up to", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\na = [input() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef is_k_good(num, k):\n    return all(digit in '0123456789'[:k+1] for digit in str(num))\n\nprint(sum(is_k_good(num, k) for num in a))\n\nThis code first reads the input and stores the numbers in a list. It then defines a function `is_k_good` that checks if a number is k-good by converting it to a string and checking if all its digits are in the string '0123456789'[:k+1]. The function is applied to each number in the list using a generator expression and the `sum` function is used to count the number of k", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\na = [input() for _ in range(n)]\nk_good_count = sum(all(int(digit) <= k for digit in str(num)) for num in a)\nprint(k_good_count)\n\n\nThis code reads the input, converts each number to a string and checks if all digits are less than or equal to k. It sums up these checks and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the input numbers are positive. If there are negative numbers in the array, you would need to adjust the code to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, the code doesn't check if the digits are not exceeding k in the number, but the numbers are k-good. If you want to check if the numbers are k-good, you would need to convert the", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\na = [input() for _ in range(n)]\nprint(sum(all(c in s for c in map(str, range(k+1))) for s in a))\n\n\nThis code firstly reads the number of elements and the maximum digit from the input, then reads the elements themselves. It then counts the number of elements that contain all digits up to k. The function `all` returns True if all elements of the iterable are True, and `map(str, range(k+1))` generates a list of all digits up to k as strings. The expression `c in s for c in map(str, range(k+1))` checks if all digits are in the string representation of each element. The `sum` function then counts the number of True values.\n\nPlease note that", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\na = [input() for _ in range(n)]\nk_good = [str(i) for i in range(k+1)]\nprint(sum(all(digit in a_i for digit in k_good) for a_i in a))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a simple Python program that reads the input and solves the problem. It first reads the number of elements in the array and the maximum digit, then reads the array itself. It then generates a list of all digits from 0 to k, and for each number in the array, it checks whether all digits from 0 to k are present in the number. It counts the number of numbers for which this is true and prints the result.\n\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLet's call a number k-good if it contains all digits not exceeding k (0, ..., k).
