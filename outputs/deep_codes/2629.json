We also initialize a variable number to 1 which will be used to fill the matrix. We also initialize 4 variables to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we need to fill.\n\nWe then enter a while loop that continues until number is greater than n*n. In each iteration of the loop, we fill the top row from left to right, then the right column from top to bottom, then the bottom row from right to left, and finally the left column from bottom to top. We update the boundaries after each iteration.\n\nFinally, we", "class Solution:\n    def generateMatrix(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        res = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        cnt = 1\n        for layer in range((n + 1) // 2):\n            for ptr in range(layer, n - layer):  # Traverse from left to right\n                res[layer][ptr] = cnt\n                cnt += 1\n            for ptr in range(layer + 1, n - layer):  # Traverse from top to bottom\n                res[ptr][- layer - 1] = cnt\n                cnt += 1\n            for ptr in range(layer + 1, n - layer):  # Traverse from right to left\n                res[- layer - 1][- ptr - 1] = cnt\n                cnt += 1\n            for ptr in range(layer + 1, n - layer - 1):  # Traverse from bottom to top\n                res[- ptr - 1][layer] = cnt\n                cnt += 1\n        return res\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution works by traversing the matrix in layers, starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards. The number of layers is (n+1)//2. For each layer, we traverse the four edges of the matrix in a clockwise manner. For each edge, we assign the next number to the corresponding position in the matrix.\n\nWe use four nested loops for each layer to traverse the four edges. The outer loop is used to iterate over the layers, and the inner loops are used to traverse the edges.

It then starts filling the matrix in a spiral pattern starting from the top left corner (0, 0) with the direction right (0, 1).\n\nThe direction of movement is determined by the variables dx and dy. Initially, dx = 0 and dy = 1, meaning the matrix is filled rightwards.\n\nThe coordinates of the next cell to be filled are calculated as (x + dx, y + dy). If this cell is within the matrix and not already filled (i.e., it contains zero), we move to this cell. Otherwise, we change direction: dx and dy are swapped and dy is negated, resulting in movement downwards.\n\nThe process continues until the matrix is filled with numbers from 1 to n^2.\n\nFinally, the filled matrix is returned.", "class Solution:\n    def generateMatrix(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        result = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        cnt = 1\n        x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1\n        for _ in range(n*n):\n            result[x][y] = cnt\n            cnt += 1\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and result[nx][ny] == 0:\n                x, y = nx, ny\n            else:\n                dx, dy = dy, -dx\n                x, y = x + dx, y + dy\n        return result\n\n\nThis solution starts by creating an n x n matrix filled with zeros. It then iterates n*n times, each time setting the current position (x, y) in the matrix to the current count (cnt), incrementing the count. The direction of movement is determined by the (dx, dy) variables. If the next position (nx, ny) is within the matrix and not yet set, it moves there; otherwise, it changes direction and moves in the current direction.\n\nThe direction change is done by swapping dx and dy and negating dx. This effectively rotates the direction of movement 90 degrees to the right.\n\nFinally, it returns the filled matrix.\n\nThis solution works by moving in a spiral pattern around the matrix.
