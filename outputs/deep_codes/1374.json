Then, the value of the (M / 2 + 1)-th element of b' is the median of b. Here, / is integer division, rounding down.\nFor example, the median of (10, 30, 20) is 20; the median of (10, 30, 20, 40) is 30; the median of (10, 10, 10, 20, 30) is 10.\nSnuke comes up with the following problem.\nYou are given a sequence a of length N.\nFor each pair (l, r) (1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq N), let m_{l, r} be the median of the contiguous subsequence (a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r) of a.\nWe will list m_{l, r} for all pairs (l, r) to create a new sequence m.\nFind the median of m.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - a_i is an integer.\n - 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 a_2 ... a_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the median of m.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n10 30 20\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n30\n\nThe median of each contiguous subsequence of a is as follows:\n - The median of (10) is 10.\n - The median of (30) is 30.\n - The median of (20) is 20.\n - The median of (10, 30) is 30.\n - The median of (30, 20) is 30.\n - The median of (10, 30, 20) is 20.\nThus, m = (10, 30, 20, 30, 30, 20) and the median of m is 30.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
