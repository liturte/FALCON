If m is even and doubling n does not make it larger than m, then we double n and increment the click counter. Otherwise, we subtract 1 from n and increment the click counter. Finally, we return the click counter.", "def min_button_clicks(n, m):\n    clicks = 0\n    while n < m:\n        if m % 2 == 0 and n * 2 <= m:\n            n *= 2\n            clicks += 1\n        else:\n            n -= 1\n            clicks += 1\n    return clicks + abs(n - m)\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_button_clicks(n, m))\n\n\nThe function `min_button_clicks` takes two parameters `n` and `m`. It initializes a variable `clicks` to 0 to keep track of the number of clicks. It then enters a loop that continues until `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Inside the", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(bin(n ^ m)[2:]) - 1)\n\n\n\nThis Python program uses bitwise XOR to calculate the number of bits that differ between the two numbers. The binary representation of the result of the XOR operation is then converted to a string. The length of this string minus 1 gives the minimum number of button presses required to transform n into m.\n\nThis solution works because XOR has the property that it flips a bit if it is different from the other number and leaves it unchanged if it is the same. Therefore, if n and m have different bits in the same positions, the result of the XOR operation will have a 1 in that position. The number of bits in the result that are 1s is the minimum number of button", "def min_clicks(n, m):\n    clicks = 0\n    while n < m:\n        if m % 2 == 1 and n * 2 < m:\n            m += 1\n            clicks += 1\n        elif m % 2 == 0 and n * 2 < m:\n            m *= 2\n            clicks += 1\n        n *= 2\n        clicks += 1\n    return clicks + abs(n - m)\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_clicks(n, m))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code works by repeatedly doubling the current number on the display and incrementing the number of clicks, until the current number is greater than or equal to the target number.

On the front panel of a device there are: a red button, a blue button and a display showing some positive integer. After clicking the red button, device multiplies the displayed number by two. After clicking the blue button, device subtracts one from the number on the display. If at some point the number stops being positive, the device breaks down. The display can show arbitrarily large numbers. Initially, the display shows number n.\n\nBob wants to get number m on the display. What minimum number of clicks he has to make in order to achieve this result?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the only line of the input contains two distinct integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^4), separated by a space .\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the minimum number of times one needs to push the button required to get the number m out of number n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n10 1\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you need to push the blue button once, and then push the red button once.\n\nIn the second example, doubling the number is unnecessary, so we need to push the blue button nine times.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
