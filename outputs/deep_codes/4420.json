Your task is to find the maximum integer $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le n$ that $k \\bmod x = y$, where $\\bmod$ is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.\n\nIn other words, with given $x, y$ and $n$ you need to find the maximum possible integer from $0$ to $n$ that has the remainder $y$ modulo $x$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such $k$ exists for each test case.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next $t$ lines contain test cases.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains three integers $x, y$ and $n$ ($2 \\le x \\le 10^9;~ 0 \\le y < x;~ y \\le n \\le 10^9$).\n\nIt can be shown that such $k$ always exists under the given constraints.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 maximum non-negative integer $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le n$ and $k \\bmod x = y$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n7 5 12345\n5 0 4\n10 5 15\n17 8 54321\n499999993 9 1000000000\n10 5 187\n2 0 999999999\n\nOutput\n12339\n0\n15\n54306\n999999995\n185\n999999998\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, the answer is $12339 = 7 \\cdot 1762 + 5$ (thus, $12339 \\bmod 7 = 5$). It is obvious that there is no greater integer not exceeding $12345$ which has the remainder $5$ modulo $7$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
