Assume a student\u2019s original score is $x$ out of a total of $100$. One of the curving methods is to apply to $x$ the curving function $f(x) = 10\\sqrt {x}$. The function may be applied $k \\geq 0$ times. For better score readability, the result is rounded to the next integer and the final curved score is $y = \\lceil f^k(x) \\rceil $. \n\nFor example, if the curving function is applied $k = 3$ times to $x = 80$, it changes the score to\\begin{align*} f^3(80) & = f^2(f(80)) = f^2(89.4427) \\\\ & = f(f(89.4427)) = f(94.5742) = 97.2492. \\end{align*}\n\nSo the curved score is $y = \\lceil 97.2492 \\rceil = 98$.\n\nJohn wants to curve a student\u2019s score $x$ using this method so that the curved score $y$ is between $y_{low}$ and $y_{high}$. How many times should he apply the curving function? In particular, what are the minimum and maximum choices of $k$, so that $y_{low} \\leq y \\leq y_{high}$?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input has a single line with three integers: $x$, $y_{low}$, and $y_{high}$ ($1 \\leq x \\leq y_{low} \\leq y_{high} \\leq 100$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum and maximum possible choices of $k$. If the curving function can be applied an infinite number of times, output \u201cinf\u201d for the maximum. If there is no $k$ that meets the curving requirement, output a single word \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n80 85 98\nSample Output 1:\n1 3\n\nSample Input 2:\n98 98 100\nSample Output 2:\n0 inf\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
