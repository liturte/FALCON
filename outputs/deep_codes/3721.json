Red dashed circles denote elements that should be purchased from other labs (the optimal solution should minimize the number of red circles). Blue dashed circles are elements that can be produced with nuclear fusion. They are numbered in order in which they can be produced.\n\nTest 1\n\nWe can use nuclear fusion and get the element from three other samples, so we don't need to purchase anything.\n\n [Image] \n\nTest 2\n\nWe cannot use any nuclear fusion at all as there is only one row, so we have to purchase all missing elements.\n\n [Image] \n\nTest 3\n\nThere are several possible solutions. One of them is illustrated below.\n\nNote that after purchasing one element marked as red it's still not possible to immidiately produce the middle element in the bottom row (marked as 4). So we produce the element in the left-top corner first (marked as 1), and then use it in future fusions.\n\n [Image]\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
