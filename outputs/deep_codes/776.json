You were given the task of buying mouses, and you have to spend as little as possible. After all, the country is in crisis!\n\nThe computers bought for the room were different. Some of them had only USB ports, some\u00a0\u2014 only PS/2 ports, and some had both options.\n\nYou have found a price list of a certain computer shop. In it, for m mouses it is specified the cost and the type of the port that is required to plug the mouse in (USB or PS/2). Each mouse from the list can be bought at most once.\n\nYou want to buy some set of mouses from the given price list in such a way so that you maximize the number of computers equipped with mouses (it is not guaranteed that you will be able to equip all of the computers), and in case of equality of this value you want to minimize the total cost of mouses you will buy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers a, b and c (0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^5) \u00a0\u2014 the number of computers that only have USB ports, the number of computers, that only have PS/2 ports, and the number of computers, that have both options, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains one integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u00a0\u2014 the number of mouses in the price list.\n\nThe next m lines each describe another mouse. The i-th line contains first integer val_{i} (1 \u2264 val_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u00a0\u2014 the cost of the i-th mouse, then the type of port (USB or PS/2) that is required to plug the mouse in.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput two integers separated by space\u00a0\u2014 the number of equipped computers and the total cost of the mouses you will buy.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2 1 1\n4\n5 USB\n6 PS/2\n3 PS/2\n7 PS/2\n\nOutput\n3 14\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can buy the first three mouses. This way you will equip one of the computers that has only a USB port with a USB mouse, and the two PS/2 mouses you will plug into the computer with PS/2 port and the computer with both ports.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
