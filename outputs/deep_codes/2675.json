Note that the first blue ball would have collided with the red ball at t = 1 (like in sample input # 1), if the second blue ball wasn't present. But since the red ball disappears at t = 0.5, its collision with first blue ball doesn't happen. The total number of collisions is 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
