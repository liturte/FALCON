You may perform any number of operations on them (possibly zero).\n\nDuring each operation you should choose any positive integer $x$ and set $a := a - x$, $b := b - 2x$ or $a := a - 2x$, $b := b - x$. Note that you may choose different values of $x$ in different operations.\n\nIs it possible to make $a$ and $b$ equal to $0$ simultaneously?\n\nYour program should answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThen the test cases follow, each test case is represented by one line containing two integers $a$ and $b$ for this test case ($0 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print the answer to it \u2014 YES if it is possible to make $a$ and $b$ equal to $0$ simultaneously, and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n6 9\n1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example two operations can be used to make both $a$ and $b$ equal to zero:  choose $x = 4$ and set $a := a - x$, $b := b - 2x$. Then $a = 6 - 4 = 2$, $b = 9 - 8 = 1$;  choose $x = 1$ and set $a := a - 2x$, $b := b - x$. Then $a = 2 - 2 = 0$, $b = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
