Since building a single rectangular net of sufficient length and height to catch all possible fogs would be prohibitively expensive, it was decided that for the best use of public money, the nets would be installed incrementally. Initially (i.e., on day\u00a0$0$), there are no nets. Each day, after all the fogs have lifted, net maintainers determine how many fogs were \u201cmissed\u201d that day\u00a0\u2013 that is, how many fogs corresponded to rectangles that were not completely contained in the region of the $x$-$y$ plane covered by nets. The workers then add rectangular net \u201cpatches\u201d of minimum total area so that the resulting array of nets would have caught all the fogs that day. The next day, the fogs roll in again, they lift, the workers add more patches (if necessary), and the cycle continues. Note that the portion of the $x$-$y$ plane covered by nets at any point in time is a union of axis-aligned rectangles, but in general does not constitute a single rectangular region.\n\nGiven a complete description of the $n$ originator fogs, count the total number of fogs that are missed.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $n$ $(n \\leq 1000)$, the number of originator fogs.
