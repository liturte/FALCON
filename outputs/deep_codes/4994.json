The x coordinate that is different is the x coordinate of the fourth point. The y coordinate that is different is the y coordinate of the fourth point.\n\nThe reason why we use `x1 if x1 != x3 else x2` and `y1 if y1 != y3 else y2` instead of `x1 if x1 != x2 else x3` and `y1 if y1 != y2 else y3` is because we need the fourth point to be different from the first point and the third point, not the second point.\n\nFor example, if the first point is (5, 5), the second point"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nMirko needs to choose four points in the plane so that they form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes.
