Yang and the monster each have 3 attributes: hitpoints (HP), offensive power (ATK) and defensive power (DEF).\n\nDuring the battle, every second the monster's HP decrease by max(0, ATK_{Y} - DEF_{M}), while Yang's HP decreases by max(0, ATK_{M} - DEF_{Y}), where index Y denotes Master Yang and index M denotes monster. Both decreases happen simultaneously Once monster's HP \u2264 0 and the same time Master Yang's HP > 0, Master Yang wins.\n\nMaster Yang can buy attributes from the magic shop of Cyberland: h bitcoins per HP, a bitcoins per ATK, and d bitcoins per DEF.\n\nNow Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers HP_{Y}, ATK_{Y}, DEF_{Y}, separated by a space, denoting the initial HP, ATK and DEF of Master Yang.\n\nThe second line contains three integers HP_{M}, ATK_{M}, DEF_{M}, separated by a space, denoting the HP, ATK and DEF of the monster.\n\nThe third line contains three integers h, a, d, separated by a space, denoting the price of 1\u00a0HP, 1\u00a0ATK and 1\u00a0DEF.\n\nAll numbers in input are integer and lie between 1 and 100 inclusively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only output line should contain an integer, denoting the minimum bitcoins Master Yang should spend in order to win.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 1\n1 100 1\n1 100 100\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n100 100 100\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, prices for ATK and DEF are extremely high. Master Yang can buy 99 HP, then he can beat the monster with 1 HP left.\n\nFor the second sample, Master Yang is strong enough to beat the monster, so he doesn't need to buy anything.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
