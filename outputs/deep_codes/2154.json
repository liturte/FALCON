You would like to profit on this knowledge, but only want to transact one share of stock per day. That is, each day you will either buy one share, sell one share, or do nothing. Initially you own zero shares, and you cannot sell shares when you don't own any. At the end of the N days you would like to again own zero shares, but want to have as much money as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput begins with an integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 3\u00b710^5), the number of days.\n\nFollowing this is a line with exactly N integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{N} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 10^6). The price of one share of stock on the i-th day is given by p_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum amount of money you can end up with at the end of N days.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n9\n10 5 4 7 9 12 6 2 10\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n20\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4\n\nOutput\n41\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, buy a share at 5, buy another at 4, sell one at 9 and another at 12. Then buy at 2 and sell at 10. The total profit is  - 5 - 4 + 9 + 12 - 2 + 10 = 20.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
