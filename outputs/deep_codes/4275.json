The characters of the string are accessed using zero-based indexing, so `S[2]` is the 3rd character, `S[3]` is the 4th character, `S[4]` is the 5th character, and `S[5]` is the 6th character. The `==` operator is used to compare the characters. If they are equal, 'Yes' is printed. If they are not equal, 'No' is printed.\n\nNote: The indexing starts from 0, so the 3rd and 4th characters are at index 2 and 3, and the 5th and 6th characters are at index 4 and 5.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string will always have 6 characters.

It then checks if these two pairs of characters are the same. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. If they are not, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe input string is assumed to be of length 6 as stated in the problem constraints.\n\nNote: Python uses zero-based indexing, so the 3rd character is at index 2, the 4th character is at index 3, the 5th character is at index 4, and the 6th character is at index 5.", "S = input()\nif S[2] == S[3] and S[4] == S[5]:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe given problem is about checking if a string is coffee-like or not. A string is considered coffee-like if the 3rd and 4th characters are the same and the 5th and 6th characters are also the same. We can solve this problem by simply checking these conditions.\n\nThe solution provided above does exactly that. It takes an input string, S, and then checks if the 3rd and 4th characters of S are the same (S[2] == S[3]) and if the 5th and 6th characters of S are the same (S[4] == S[5]). If both conditions are met, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nThis solution is efficient and does not require any additional processing, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only performs a constant number of comparisons. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input string and the output.\n\nPlease note that the string indexing in Python starts from 0, so the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA string of length 6 consisting of lowercase English letters is said to be coffee-like if and only if its 3-rd and 4-th characters are equal and its 5-th and 6-th characters are also equal.\n\nGiven a string S, determine whether it is coffee-like.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is a string of length 6 consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nIf S is coffee-like, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nsippuu\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nIn sippuu, the 3-rd and 4-th characters are equal, and the 5-th and 6-th characters are also equal.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
