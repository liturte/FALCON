The result is then printed to the console.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be in the correct format and within the specified range.

If D is 0, it simply prints N as the answer. If D is 1, it checks if N is 100, if it is it prints 10100 otherwise it prints N*100. If D is 2, it checks if N is 100, if it is it prints 101010", "D, N = map(int, input().split())\nif D == 0:\n    print(N)\nelif D == 1:\n    if N == 100:\n        print(10100)\n    else:\n        print(N*100)\nelse:\n    if N == 100:\n        print(1010100)\n    else:\n        print((N*100)+100)\n\n\nThis code works by first checking the value of D. If D is 0, then the number is simply N. If D is 1, then the number is N*100. If D is 2, then the number is (N*100)+100. This is based on the problem statement, which states that the number should be divisible by 100 exactly D times.\n\nThe code then checks if", "D, N = map(int, input().split())\nprint((N+D-1)//D*100)\n\n\nThis Python code takes the input D and N, and calculates the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. The calculation is done using integer division, which rounds down to the nearest integer, and then multiplied by 100 to get the required result.\n\nThe use of `(N+D-1)//D` instead of `N//D` ensures that the result is rounded up, so that it is the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.\n\nFor example, for the input `0 5`, the output will be `5`.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., that D is 0, 1, or 2, and that", "D, N = map(int, input().split())\nprint(N if N != 100 else N - 1)\n\n\nThis code works by first reading in the values of D and N from the standard input. It then prints the value of N if N is not equal to 100. If N is equal to 100, it prints N - 1 instead, since 100 can be divided by 100 exactly D times (where D is 0 or 1 in this case).\n\nThe reason we check if N is not equal to 100 is because we want to return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. If D is 0, then we don't need to check for divisibility by 100 at all, so we can simply return N as the N-th smallest integer. If D is 1, then we need"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nToday, the memorable AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 takes place.
