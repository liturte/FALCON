Each card has a letter a, b or c written on it. The orders of the cards in the decks cannot be rearranged.\n - The players take turns. Alice goes first.\n - If the current player's deck contains at least one card, discard the top card in the deck. Then, the player whose name begins with the letter on the discarded card, takes the next turn. (For example, if the card says a, Alice takes the next turn.)\n - If the current player's deck is empty, the game ends and the current player wins the game.\nYou are given the initial decks of the players.\nMore specifically, you are given three strings S_A, S_B and S_C. The i-th (1\u2266i\u2266|S_A|) letter in S_A is the letter on the i-th card in Alice's initial deck. S_B and S_C describes Bob's and Charlie's initial decks in the same way.\nDetermine the winner of the game.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266|S_A|\u2266100\n - 1\u2266|S_B|\u2266100\n - 1\u2266|S_C|\u2266100\n - Each letter in S_A, S_B, S_C is a, b or c.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS_A\nS_B\nS_C\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Alice will win, print A. If Bob will win, print B. If Charlie will win, print C.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\naca\naccc\nca\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nA\n\nThe game will progress as below:\n - Alice discards the top card in her deck, a. Alice takes the next turn.\n - Alice discards the top card in her deck, c. Charlie takes the next turn.\n - Charlie discards the top card in his deck, c. Charlie takes the next turn.\n - Charlie discards the top card in his deck, a. Alice takes the next turn.\n - Alice discards the top card in her deck, a. Alice takes the next turn.\n - Alice's deck is empty. The game ends and Alice wins the game.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
