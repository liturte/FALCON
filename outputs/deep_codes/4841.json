It then iterates over this list. If a word is not \"mumble\", it checks if the word can be converted to an integer and if this integer is not equal to the current index plus one (since indices are 1-indexed).

His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud. \n\nUnfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild\u2019s counting makes sense or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains $n$ space-separated words spoken by Arild, the $i$\u2019th of which is either a non-negative integer $a_ i$ ($0 \\le a_ i \\le 10000$) or the string \u201cmumble\u201d.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Arild\u2019s counting might make sense, print the string \u201cmakes sense\u201d. Otherwise, print the string \u201csomething is fishy\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n1 2 3 mumble 5\nSample Output 1:\nmakes sense\n\nSample Input 2:\n8\n1 2 3 mumble mumble 7 mumble 8\nSample Output 2:\nsomething is fishy\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
