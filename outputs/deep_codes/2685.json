You decide to fix the string by putting the numbers 0 and 1 in the empty spaces. \nThe base cost for putting the \u20180\u2019  is x  and putting \u20181\u2019  is y . The cost of putting a number is the base cost multiplied by the number of times you use the letter till  that position (including   the position ).  The local mayor is happy with your work and commissions you for every number you put. \n\nMore specifically ,  if you put , say 0  in 5th position, the mayor will count the number of occurrences of 0  till 5th   position and pay you the same amount. You wonder what the minimum cost for fixing the string is. Note  \u2013 The answer can also be negative, they denote that you got an overall profit.\n\nInput Format: \n\nThe input consists of 2 lines. First-line consists of the string of numbers S. \u2018?\u2019  denotes an empty position. \n\nThe second line consists of 2 integers x,y, the base cost of 0 and 1. \n\nOutput Format:  \n\nOutput 1 integer, the minimum cost of fixing the string.\n\nConstraints :  \n\n1<=|S|<=100\n\n1<=x,y<=100 \n\nSample Input:  \n\n501?1?\n\n6 5\n\nSample Output:  \n\n6\n\nSample Input:  \n\n1001?11?\n\n5  23\n\nSample Output:  \n\n8\n\nExplanation  :  \n\nFill 0 in the first place, the net cost will be 6-2=4. In the second place fill, 1 the net cost will be 5-3=2 Hence total cost is 4+2=6. \n\nIn second test case we will fill both spaces with zero , filling first zero costs  1*5-3=2 and filling the other zero costs  2*5  - 4 =6  , so total being 8.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
