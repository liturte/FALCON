Now he is going to find a new place to work. Despite being such a well-known person, he still needs a CV to apply for a job.\n\nDuring all his career Hideo has produced n games. Some of them were successful, some were not. Hideo wants to remove several of them (possibly zero) from his CV to make a better impression on employers. As a result there should be no unsuccessful game which comes right after successful one in his CV.\n\nMore formally, you are given an array s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} of zeros and ones. Zero corresponds to an unsuccessful game, one \u2014 to a successful one. Games are given in order they were produced, and Hideo can't swap these values. He should remove some elements from this array in such a way that no zero comes right after one.\n\nBesides that, Hideo still wants to mention as much games in his CV as possible. Help this genius of a man determine the maximum number of games he can leave in his CV.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integer numbers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (0 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 1). 0 corresponds to an unsuccessful game, 1 \u2014 to a successful one.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum number of games Hideo can leave in his CV so that no unsuccessful game comes after a successful one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 1 0 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6\n0 1 0 0 1 0\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1\n0\n\nOutput\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
