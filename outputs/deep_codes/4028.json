A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters '(' and ')'.\n\nA regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.\n\nYour problem is to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences of length $2n$ containing the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring (consecutive sequence of characters) modulo $10^9+7$ ($1000000007$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the half-length of the resulting regular bracket sequences (the resulting sequences must have length equal to $2n$).\n\nThe second line of the input contains one string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 200$) \u2014 the string $s$ that should be a substring in each of the resulting regular bracket sequences ($|s|$ is the length of $s$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint only one integer \u2014 the number of regular bracket sequences containing the given bracket sequence $s$ as a substring. Since this number can be huge, print it modulo $10^9+7$ ($1000000007$).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n()))()\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n3\n(()\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n2\n(((\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nAll regular bracket sequences satisfying the conditions above for the first example:   \"(((()))())\";  \"((()()))()\";  \"((()))()()\";  \"(()(()))()\";  \"()((()))()\". \n\nAll regular bracket sequences satisfying the conditions above for the second example:   \"((()))\";  \"(()())\";  \"(())()\";  \"()(())\". \n\nAnd there is no regular bracket sequences of length $4$ containing \"(((\" as a substring in the third example.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
