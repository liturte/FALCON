It then checks if the last digit of N (N % 10) is 9 or the first digit of N (N // 10) is 9. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'.

Similarly, `N // 10` is the integer division of N by 10, which is the first digit of N. If either of these is 9, then 9 is in the decimal notation of N.\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"", "print('Yes' if input()[-1] == '9' else 'No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads an integer from the input, converts it to a string, and checks the last character of the string. If the last character is '9', it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe `input()` function reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string. The `[-1]` index is used to access the last character of the string. The `== '9'` comparison checks if the last character is '9'. The `print` function prints the result.\n\nThe `else` clause is used to specify what to print if the condition is not met. In this case, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis program is written in Python.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input will always be a two-digit integer. If this is not the case, you may need to add additional error checking code to handle non-integer inputs or integers that are not two digits.", "N = int(input())\nif str(9) in str(N):\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a simple python program that reads an integer from the standard input, converts it to a string, and checks if the string contains the character '9'. If it does, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.\n\nIt uses the `str` function to convert the integer to a string, and the `in` operator to check if the string contains the character '9'.\n\nThe `int(input())` function reads an integer from the standard input.\n\nThe `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis solution works for all valid inputs as per the constraints.\n\nIt is also efficient as it does not involve any looping or complex calculations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.\n\nThe space complexity is also O(1), which means it always uses the same amount of memory to store the input and output.\n\nTherefore, this solution is both time and space efficient.\n\nNote: The input is read as a string to avoid any potential issues with leading zeros.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test cases\nprint(\"Test cases\")\nprint(\"Expected: Yes, Actual:\", \"Yes\" if \"9\" in str(29) else \"No\")\nprint(\"Expected: No, Actual:\", \"Yes\" if \"9\" in str(18", "N = int(input())\nprint('Yes' if str(N).count('9') > 0 else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution reads the input number, converts it to a string, and then uses the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the digit 9. If the count is greater than 0, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe str() function is used to convert the integer to a string, and the count() method is used to count the number of times the character '9' appears in the string.\n\nThe input() function is used to read the input from the user, and the int() function is used to convert the input to an integer.\n\nThe print() function is used to print the result.\n\nThe 'Yes' if str(N).count('9') > 0 else 'No' part is a ternary expression that is equivalent to an if-else statement. It prints 'Yes' if the count of '9' in the string representation of N is greater than 0, and 'No' otherwise.\n\nThe solution assumes that the input is always a two-digit integer between 10 and 99. If the input could be outside this range, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nThe solution is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\n\n# Read the input number\nN = int(input())\n\n# Convert the number to a string and count the number of 9s\nnum_nines = str(N).count('9')\n\n# Print the result", "N = int(input())\nif '9' in str(N):\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code reads an integer from the input, converts it to a string, and checks if the string contains the character '9'. If it does, it prints \"Yes\". If it doesn't, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis code will work for any two-digit integer where 10 <= N <= 99.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input will be a valid two-digit integer. If the input is not a valid two-digit integer, the code may not behave as expected.\n\nIn this case, the input is guaranteed to be a two-digit integer by the problem constraints. So, there's no need to add error checking for that."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIt is September 9 in Japan now.\nYou are given a two-digit integer N.
