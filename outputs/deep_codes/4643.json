It then sorts the prices in ascending order using the built-in sort() method. Finally, it prints out the sorted prices, joined by spaces.\n\nThe map() function is used to convert the integers back into strings for the join() method, which is required because join() can only join strings.\n\nThe '*' operator is used to unpack the input into the 'n' variable and the 'tickets' variable. This means that 'n' is assigned the first value from the input, and 'tickets' is assigned the remaining values.\n\nThe input().split() function is used to split the input line into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by the map() function.\n\nThe print() function is used to output the sorted prices.\n\nThis program will work for any valid input as long as the number of tickets (n) and the prices of the tickets are provided, and the prices are within the range specified", "n = int(input().split()[0])\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsorted_prices = sorted(prices)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, sorted_prices)))\n\n\nThis code takes input for the number of elements and the elements themselves, sorts them in non-descending order, and prints the sorted array.\n\nThe `split()` function separates the input into a list of strings, and `int(input().split()[0])` takes the first element of that list (i.e., the number of elements in the array).\n\nThe `map(int, input().split())` function converts the input strings into integers, and `list()` turns the resulting iterable into a list.\n\nThe `sorted()` function sorts the list in non-descending order.\n\nFinally, `' '.join(map(str, sorted_prices))` converts the sorted list of integers back into a string, with each integer separated by a space.\n\nThis code is written in Python.", "n, *lst = map(int, input().split())\nlst.sort()\nprint(*lst)\n\n\nThis code reads the input, splits it into the number of elements `n` and the list of elements `lst`, sorts the list in non-descending order, and then prints the sorted list. The `*` operator is used to unpack the list, so that it can be printed as space-separated values.\n\nFor example, if you input \"3 3 1 2\", the output will be \"1 2 3\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be in the correct format, as described in the problem statement."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are developing a new feature for the website which sells airline tickets: being able to sort tickets by price! You have already extracted the tickets' prices, so there's just the last step to be done...\n\nYou are given an array of integers.
