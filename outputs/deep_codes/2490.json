The binary representation of a number is the same as the number of banknotes needed to represent that number with denominations of powers of 2.

There are 10^{100}+1 kinds of banknotes, with the values of 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \\dots, 10^{(10^{100})}. You have come shopping at a mall and are now buying a takoyaki machine with a value of N. (Takoyaki is the name of a Japanese snack.)\nTo make the payment, you will choose some amount of money which is at least N and give it to the clerk. Then, the clerk gives you back the change, which is the amount of money you give minus N.\nWhat will be the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, when both choose the combination of banknotes to minimize this count?\nAssume that you have sufficient numbers of banknotes, and so does the clerk.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n36\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n8\n\nIf you give four banknotes of value 10 each, and the clerk gives you back four banknotes of value 1 each, a total of eight banknotes are used.\nThe payment cannot be made with less than eight banknotes in total, so the answer is 8.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
