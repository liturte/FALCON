Finally, it prints R2.\n\nThe formula used here is derived from the relationship between R1, R2, and S as described in the question.\n\nFor example, if R1 = 11 and S = 15, the code calculates R2 = 15 * 2 - 11 = 31 - 11 = 20, so the output is 20.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be valid and that the relationship between R1, R2, and S holds.\n\nAlso, note that the question states that R1 and R2 are integers between -1000 and 1000. However, this code does not check for this range, so if the input falls outside this range, the output may not be correct.\n\nIf you need to check the range, you can add a condition before calculating R2 to check if R1 and S are within the allowed range.\n\nFor example:\n\nif -1000 <= R1 <= 1000 and -100", "R1, S = map(int, input().split())\nR2 = S * 2 - R1\nprint(R2)\n\n\nThis code works by first taking in the input for R1 and S. It then calculates R2 using the formula for the mean of two numbers. This formula is R2 = (R1 + S) - R1 = S. Finally, it prints R2.\n\nThis code is a direct translation of the mathematical formula for the mean of two numbers into Python code. It takes advantage of Python's ability to perform arithmetic operations directly on variables and the map function to take in multiple inputs at once.\n\nIt's worth noting that this code assumes that the input will always be in the range [-1000, 1000] as specified in the problem statement. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be needed.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this code uses the identity R2 = S - R1, which is derived from the formula for the mean of two numbers. The formula for the mean of two numbers is (R1 + R2) / 2 = S, which when rearranged gives R2 = S - R1.\n\nThis code is efficient and should run in O(1) time, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.\n\nThis code", "R1, S = map(int, input().split())\nR2 = S * 2 - R1\nprint(R2)\n\n\nThis program works by first taking the two input values from the user. It then calculates the value of $R_2$ using the formula given in the problem statement, which is $R_2 = 2*S - R_1$. Finally, it prints out the value of $R_2$.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not include any error checking or handling.\n\nThis code is written in Python and it is a simple and efficient solution for the problem.\n\nPlease note that the problem statement mentions that $R_1$ and $R_2$ are integers. However, in the code, the input values are read as integers. If the input values are not integers, the code will not work correctly. If you are sure that the input values are always integers, you can remove the line that reads the input values.\n\nAlso, note that the code does not include any error checking or handling. If the input values are not between -1000 and 1000, the code will not work correctly. If you need to handle this situation, you can add appropriate error checking and handling code.\n\nThis code is written in Python and it is a simple and efficient solution for the problem", "R1, S = map(int, input().split())\nR2 = 2*S - R1\nprint(R2)\n\n\nThis Python code works by taking in two integers from the user, one for R1 and one for S. It then calculates R2 using the formula R2 = 2*S - R1 and prints the result.\n\nThe formula for calculating R2 is derived from the equation S = (R1 + R2) / 2. If you multiply both sides of this equation by 2, you get 2*S = R1 + 2*R2. If you subtract R1 from both sides, you get R2 = 2*S - R1.\n\nThis formula is used to calculate R2 based on the known values of R1 and S.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the provided integers are valid and within the specified range.\n\nThis code will work for all test cases as it directly applies the formula for calculating R2 based on R1 and S.\n\nAlso, this code does not need any comments or explanations as it directly applies the formula for calculating R2 based on R1 and S.", "R1, S = map(int, input().split())\nR2 = 2*S - R1\nprint(R2)\n\n\nThis program works by using the formula for the mean of two numbers, which is $(R_1+R_2)/2 = S$. Rearranging this formula to find $R_2$ gives $R_2 = 2*S - R_1$. We can then calculate $R_2$ by substituting the input values for $R_1$ and $S$.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input values from strings to integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input line into a list of strings, and the `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis program assumes that the input values are valid and that the mean of $R_1$ and $R_2$ is an integer. If this is not the case, the program may not work correctly or may crash.\n\nThe program also assumes that the input values are within the specified range. If they are not, the program may not work correctly or may give incorrect results.\n\nPlease note that this program does not include any error checking or exception handling.
