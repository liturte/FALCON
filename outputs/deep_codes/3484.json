Whenever they see a puzzle like Sudoku, they cannot stop themselves from solving it. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a $9\\times 9$ grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine ($3\\times 3$) subgrids that compose the grid (also called \u201cboxes\u201d, \u201cblocks\u201d, or \u201cregions\u201d) contains all of the digits from $1$ to $9$. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.\n\nAfter many years of solving Sudoku problems, Alice and Bob are tired of Sudoku. They have been trying to develop a harder variation of Sudoku, which they are calling Superdoku. In Superdoku, the grid is bigger \u2013 $n\\times n$ instead of just $9\\times 9$. However, the \u201cblock\u201d constraints are impossible to formulate when there are no further constraints on $n$. Therefore, there are no block constraints in Superdoku. Instead, the goal is simply to make sure that each column and each row in the grid contains all of the integers from $1$ to $n$. After playing for a while in the standard way (where any of the grid cells may have previously been filled in), they decide that the game is too difficult and they want to simplify it. Therefore, they decide to make the initial grid further constrained. They constrain the board by filling in the first $k$ rows completely.\n\nAlice and Bob both believe that Superdoku is solvable.
