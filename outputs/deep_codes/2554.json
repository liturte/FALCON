Indices of the array start from zero (i. e. the first element is $a_0$, the second one is $a_1$, and so on).\n\nYou can reverse at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of this array. Recall that the subarray of $a$ with borders $l$ and $r$ is $a[l; r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_{r}$.\n\nYour task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum of elements on even positions of the resulting array is maximized (i. e. the sum of elements $a_0, a_2, \\dots, a_{2k}$ for integer $k = \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ should be maximum possible).\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer on the separate line \u2014 the maximum possible sum of elements on even positions after reversing at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of $a$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n8\n1 7 3 4 7 6 2 9\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n10\n7 8 4 5 7 6 8 9 7 3\n4\n3 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n26\n5\n37\n5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
