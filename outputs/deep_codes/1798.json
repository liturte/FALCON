The boy immediately decided to analyze the sequence. For that, he needs to find all values of x, for which these conditions hold:\n\n  x occurs in sequence a.  Consider all positions of numbers x in the sequence a (such i, that a_{i} = x). These numbers, sorted in the increasing order, must form an arithmetic progression. \n\nHelp Jeff, find all x that meet the problem conditions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5). The numbers are separated by spaces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print integer t \u2014 the number of valid x. On each of the next t lines print two integers x and p_{x}, where x is current suitable value, p_{x} is the common difference between numbers in the progression (if x occurs exactly once in the sequence, p_{x} must equal 0). Print the pairs in the order of increasing x.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n1\n2 0\n\nInput\n8\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1 5\n\nOutput\n4\n1 2\n2 4\n3 0\n5 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test 2 occurs exactly once in the sequence, ergo p_2 = 0.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
