For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.\n\nIn the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.\n\nIn the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
