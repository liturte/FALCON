Arya have to find the value $x \\text{mod} k$. There are n ancient numbers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} and Pari has to tell Arya $x \\operatorname{mod} c_{i}$ if Arya wants. Given k and the ancient values, tell us if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x or not. Formally, is it true that Arya can understand the value $x \\text{mod} k$ for any positive integer x?\n\nNote, that $x \\text{mod} y$ means the remainder of x after dividing it by y.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n,  k \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of ancient integers and value k that is chosen by Pari.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 1 000 000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes) if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x, or \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n2 3 5 12\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n2 7\n2 3\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Arya can understand $x \\operatorname{mod} 5$ because 5 is one of the ancient numbers.\n\nIn the second sample, Arya can't be sure what $x \\text{mod} 7$ is. For example 1 and 7 have the same remainders after dividing by 2 and 3, but they differ in remainders after dividing by 7.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
