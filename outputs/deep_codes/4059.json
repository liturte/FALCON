If it is, then it means that there are two numbers A and B such that A * B = i and A + B = N/i. Therefore, it increments the count by 2.

Finally, it returns the count.\n\nPlease note that this code has a time complexity of O(N^2), so it may not be efficient for large values of N.\n\nAlso, this code does not consider the case where A = B, because in this case, C would be zero, which does not satisfy the equation A*B + C = N.\n\nPlease note that this code does not consider the case where A = B, because in this case, C would be zero, which does not satisfy the equation A*B + C = N.", "def solve(N):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, N+1):\n        if N % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nN = int(input())\nprint(solve(N))\n\n\nThis code takes an integer N as input and calculates the number of tuples (A, B, C) that satisfy the equation A*B + C = N.

The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.\n\nNote: The `math.isqrt(N)` function is used to get the integer square root of N. This is equivalent to `int(math.sqrt(N))` but faster.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is a positive integer.
