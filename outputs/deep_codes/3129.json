After that, it counts the number of 'C' in the string and subtracts it from the length of the string. The result is the minimum number of operations Peter has to execute.\n\nThis solution works because each 'CP' or 'PC' pair can be replaced with one operation, which moves one infected hay bale to the end of the sequence. Each 'CC' can also be replaced with one operation, which moves one infected hay bale to the end of the sequence. Each 'PP' pair can be replaced with two operations, which move two infected hay bales to the end of the sequence. Therefore, the total number of", "s = input()\ni = 0\nops = 0\nwhile 'PPC' in s or 'CCC' in s:\n    if 'PPC' in s:\n        i = s.index('PPC')\n        s = s[:i] + 'PPC' + s[i+3:]\n        ops += 1\n    elif 'CCC' in s:\n        i = s.index('CCC')\n        s = s[:i] + 'CCC' + s[i+3:]\n        ops += 1\nprint(ops)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is about sorting hay bales of different types in a sequence. The algorithm works by repeatedly identifying and replacing 'PPC' or 'CCC' substrings with 'PPC' or 'CCC', respectively, and incrementing a counter for each such replacement. The process continues until no more 'PPC' or 'CCC' substrings are found in the sequence. The number of replacements is the minimum number of operations needed to sort the hay bales.\n\nIn Python, the algorithm uses the `index()` method to find the position of a substring in", "def min_operations(s):\n    return sum(s[i] == 'P' and s[i + 1] == 'C' and s[i + 2] == 'P' for i in range(len(s) - 2))\n\ns = input()\nprint(min_operations(s))\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the string and checking if there are three consecutive characters 'P', 'C', and 'P'. If there are, it counts that as one operation. It then sums up all these operations to get the total minimum number of operations.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string $s$ is valid and does not contain any other characters. It also assumes that the string $s$ is at least 3 characters long.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it scans the string once to count the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as it does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input.\n\nPlease note that the solution assumes that the input string is a sequence of hay bales, where 'C' represents a clean hay b", "def min_operations(s):\n    return min(s.count('PC'), s.count('CP'))\n\ns = input()\nprint(min_operations(s))\n\n\nThis solution works by counting the number of 'PC' and 'CP' substrings in the input string. The number of operations needed to sort the hay bales is the minimum of these two counts. The 'PC' and 'CP' substrings represent the two possible ways to sort the hay bales, with 'C' representing clean hay bales and 'P' representing infected ones.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it involves counting the number of 'PC' and 'CP' substrings in the string.\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input string and the counts of 'PC' and 'CP' substrings.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# ----------------------------------\n# SOLUTION 2\n# ----------------------------------\n\n\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nPeter has lined up hay bales.

If there are no 'P's or all hay bales are 'P', we don't need to do anything, so we print 0. Otherwise, we print the minimum of the number of 'P's and the number of hay bales that are not 'P', because moving the 'P's to the front or back of the sequence will minimize the number of operations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
