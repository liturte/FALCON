Then he flies over the patch of lava for $10$ seconds.\n\nIn the third sample, the water pond is much smaller. Bob first swims over the water pond, taking him $3$ seconds. However, he cannot fly over the lava just yet, as he only has one stamina while he needs two. So he swims back for half a meter, and then half a meter forward, taking him $3$ seconds in total. Now he has $2$ stamina, so he can spend $2$ seconds flying over the lava.\n\nIn the fourth sample, he walks for $50$ seconds, flies for $10$ seconds, swims for $15$ seconds, and finally flies for $5$ seconds.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
