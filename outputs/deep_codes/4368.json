The `bin` function converts N to binary and returns it as a string. The `len` function is used to find the length of the binary string, which is equivalent to the number of digits in base K. The `- 2` is used to subtract 2 from the length because the `bin` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which is not part of the binary representation.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If the input can be negative, you would need to modify the solution to handle that case.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses the `bin` function, which is a built-in function in Python. This solution does not use any external libraries or packages.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses the `bin` function to convert N to base K, which takes O(log N) time. The `len` function takes O(1) time to find the length of the string. Therefore, the total time complexity of the solution is O(log N).\n\nThis solution is also correct because the `bin` function in Python correctly converts an integer to binary.\n\nThis solution works for all values of N and K that are within the constraints given in the problem statement.\n\"\"\"\n\n# In the case of a binary conversion, the length", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(bin(N)) - 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe bin() function in Python converts a given integer number into binary format. The resulting string has a prefix '0b' that indicates it is a binary number. Hence, we subtract 2 from the length of the resulting string to get the number of digits.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(bin(N)) - 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe bin() function in Python converts a given integer number into binary format.

We subtract 2 from the length of this string to exclude the '0b' prefix.\n\nFor example, if N is 11 and K is 2, the binary representation is '0b1011', and the length of this string is 6. We subtract 2 to get the number of digits in the binary representation of 11, which is 4.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is correct and does not handle any errors that might occur if the input is not in the correct format.\n\nAlso, please note that this solution is written in Python. If you need a solution in a different programming language, please provide the programming language you need the solution in.\n\nThis solution uses the built-in functions bin and len, which are available in most programming languages. If you are using a language that does not have these functions, you will need to implement them yourself.\n\nIn Python, you can implement the bin function like this:\n\n\ndef bin(n", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(len(bin(N)) - 2)\n\n\nThis Python solution uses built-in functions to convert the integer to binary and find its length. The length of binary representation of a number includes '0b' in Python, so we subtract 2 to get the number of digits.\n\nIn the given problem, 1 <= N <= 10^9 and 2 <= K <= 10, so the length of the binary representation of N will not exceed 60. The conversion to binary is done in constant time, so the solution is efficient.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is valid and does not include error checking or exception handling. If the input may not be valid, additional code should be added to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, this solution uses the built-in function bin() to convert the number to binary. If it's not allowed to use built-in functions, the conversion to binary would need to be implemented manually.\n\n\nQUESTION:\nGiven an integer N, find the number of digits that N has in base K.\n\n-----Notes-----\nFor information on base-K representation, see Positional notation - Wikipedia.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9\n - 2 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is an integer N.
