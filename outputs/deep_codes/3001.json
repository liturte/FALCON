Each wheel is mounted so that it can advance to the next digit in a single step, e.g., from 3 to 4, or from 8 to 9.\n\nIt is also possible to advance from digit 9 to digit 0.

The palindrome must respect leading zeros, e.g., 0011 is not a palindrome.\n\nFor example, for input 610, it takes four steps. This can be done by incrementing the 6 wheel four times, resulting in 010.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput will consist of single line containing an integer of $1$ to $40$ digits.
