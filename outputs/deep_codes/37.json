He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.\n\nFor every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 6 15\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n3 2 7\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n6 11 6\n\nOutput\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from Ebony and 2 from Ivory to deal exactly 1\u00b73 + 2\u00b72 = 7 damage. In the third sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from ebony and no bullets from ivory to do 1\u00b76 + 0\u00b711 = 6 damage.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
