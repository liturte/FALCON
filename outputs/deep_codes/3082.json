Each dish description is in one of the following two forms:\n - A description of the form \u201cD $w_ i$ $t_ i$ $\\Delta t_ i$\u201d indicates that this is a discrete dish where each item weighs $w_ i$ grams, with initial tastiness $t_ i$ and decay of tastiness $\\Delta t_ i$.\n - A description of the form \u201cC $t_ i$ $\\Delta t_ i$\u201d indicates that this is a continuous dish with initial tastiness $t_ i$ and decay of tastiness $\\Delta t_ i$.\n\nThe numbers $w_ i$, $t_ i$, and $\\Delta t_ i$ are integers satisfying $1 \\le w_ i \\le {10000}$ and $0 \\le t_ i, \\Delta t_ i \\le {10000}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the maximum possible total tastiness of a meal of weight $w$ based on the available dishes.
