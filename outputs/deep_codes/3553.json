I have an awesome task with chameleons, $5$-th task for Saturday\u2019s competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead\u2026\u201d\n\n(\u2026)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too difficult, I have an easier one, they won\u2019t even solve that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are given an array of $N$ integers from the interval $[1, K]$. You need to process $M$ queries. The first type of query requires you to change a number in the array to a different value, and the second type of query requires you to determine the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the current array that contains all numbers from $1$ to $K$.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm, I can do it in $\\mathrm{O}(N^6)$. What\u2019s the limit for $N$?\u201d\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $N$, $K$ and $M$ ($1 \\leq N, M \\leq 100000$, $1 \\leq K \\leq 50$). The second line of input contains $N$ integers separated by space, the integers from the array. After that, $M$ queries follow, each in one of the following two forms:\n - \u201c1 p v\u201d\u2014change the value of the $p$-th number into $v$ ($1 \\leq p \\leq N, 1 \\leq v \\leq K$)\n - \u201c2\u201d\u2014what is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the array containing all the integers from $1$ to $K$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output must consist of the answers to the queries of the second type, each in its own line. If the required subarray doesn\u2019t exist, output -1.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 3 5\n2 3 1 2\n2\n1 3 3\n2\n1 1 1\n2\nSample Output:\n3\n-1\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
