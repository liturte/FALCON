There are riots on the streets... Famous Uzhlyandian superheroes Shean the Sheep and Stas the Giraffe were called in order to save the situation. Upon the arriving, they found that citizens are worried about maximum values of the Main Uzhlyandian Function f, which is defined as follows:$f(l, r) = \\sum_{i = l}^{r - 1}|a [ i ] - a [ i + 1 ]|\\cdot(- 1)^{i - l}$\n\nIn the above formula, 1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n must hold, where n is the size of the Main Uzhlyandian Array a, and |x| means absolute value of x. But the heroes skipped their math lessons in school, so they asked you for help. Help them calculate the maximum value of f among all possible values of l and r for the given array a.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the array a.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (-10^9 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the array elements.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of f.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 4 2 3 1\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n4\n1 5 4 7\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, the optimal value of f is reached on intervals [1, 2] and [2, 5].\n\nIn the second case maximal value of f is reachable only on the whole array.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
