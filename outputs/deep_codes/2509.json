{"2509": {"code": ["N, K = map(int, input().split())\nans = 0\nfor a in range(K+1, N+1):\n    ans += N//a*max(0, (N%a)-K+1)\n    ans += max(0, a-K+1)\nprint(ans)\n\n\nThe solution works by iterating over all possible values of `a` in the range `[K+1, N]`. For each `a`, we calculate how many `b` values are valid (i.e., `b` is such that `a%b >= K`) and add this to our total count `ans`. The count of valid `b` values is determined by two parts:\n\n1. The number of `b` values that are smaller than `a//2+1` (i.e., `b` is in the range `[K+1, a//2+1]`).\n2. The number of `b` values that are in the range `[a//2+1, a-K+1]`.\n\nThe first part is `max(0, (a//2+1)-K+1)`, and the second part is `max(0, a-K+1)`.

If they are, we add `1` to the count.\nThe total count of the pairs is the sum of the counts for all `i`.\n'''\n\n# Python Code\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nans = 0\nfor i in range(K+1, N+1):\n    ans += (N//i)*(i-K) + max(0, N%i-K", "N, K", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nprint(sum(N // i - 1 for i in range(K+1, N+1)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution works by iterating over all possible values of 'b' (from K+1 to N) and calculating how many times 'a' can be divided by 'b' without a remainder (N // i).
