This way the total income is $(10 + 2) + (4 + 4 + 4) = 24$.\n\nIn the second example ChemForces can choose the only element $10^9$, while TopChemist can choose ($14, 92, 35$). This way the total income is $(239) + (15 + 65 + 89) = 408$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
