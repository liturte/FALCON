The flights from A to B depart at time moments $1$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ and arrive at B at time moments $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, respectively. The flights from B to C depart at time moments $1$, $2$, $3$, $9$, and $10$ and arrive at C at time moments $2$, $3$, $4$, $10$, $11$, respectively. You can cancel at most two flights. The optimal solution is to cancel the first flight from A to B and the fourth flight from B to C. This way Arkady has to take the second flight from A to B, arrive at B at time moment $4$, and take the last flight from B to C arriving at C at time moment $11$.\n\nIn the second example you can simply cancel all flights from A to B and you're done.\n\nIn the third example you can cancel only one flight, and the optimal solution is to cancel the first flight from A to B. Note that there is still just enough time to catch the last flight from B to C.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
