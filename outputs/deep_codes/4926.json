You may have encountered $e$ in calculus or economics (for computing compound interest), or perhaps as the base of the natural logarithm, $\\ln {x}$, on your calculator.\n\nWhile $e$ can be calculated as a limit, there is a good approximation that can be made using discrete mathematics. The formula for $e$ is:\\begin{align*} e & = \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=0}^n\\dfrac {1}{i!}\\\\ & = \\dfrac {1}{0!} +\\dfrac {1}{1!} +\\dfrac {1}{2!}+\\dfrac {1}{3!}+\\dfrac {1}{4!} + \\cdots \\\\ \\end{align*}\n\nNote that $0! = 1$. Now as $n$ approaches $\\infty $, the series converges to $e$. When $n$ is any positive constant, the formula serves as an approximation of the actual value of $e$. (For example, at $n=10$ the approximation is already accurate to $7$ decimals.)\n\nYou will be given a single input, a value of $n$, and your job is to compute the approximation of $e$ for that value of $n$.\n\n-----Input-----\nA single integer $n$, ranging from $0$ to $10000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nA single real number \u2013 the approximation of $e$ computed by the formula with the given $n$.
