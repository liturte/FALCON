{"2285": {"code": ["QUESTION:\nAn IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number is recorded in blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks are separated by colons \u2014 8 blocks in total, each block has four hexadecimal digits. Here is an example of the correct record of a IPv6 address: \"0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef\". We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full.\n\nBesides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block should contain at least one digit in the short format.
