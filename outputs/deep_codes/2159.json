Balls are numbered 1 through n, from left to right. There are n possible colors, also numbered 1 through n. The i-th ball has color t_{i}.\n\nFor a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.\n\nThere are $\\frac{n \\cdot(n + 1)}{2}$ non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of balls.\n\nThe second line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 n) where t_{i} is the color of the i-th ball.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where i is a dominant color.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n7 3 0 0 \n\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n6 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, color 2 is dominant in three intervals:  An interval [2, 2] contains one ball. This ball's color is 2 so it's clearly a dominant color.  An interval [4, 4] contains one ball, with color 2 again.  An interval [2, 4] contains two balls of color 2 and one ball of color 1. \n\nThere are 7 more intervals and color 1 is dominant in all of them.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
