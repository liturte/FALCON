In $\\sim $s you build a house, start a family, and slowly, but surely, gain riches and fame. One particular day in the game there was a $30$ year anniversary party and Bjarki\u2019s characters invited all their friends.\n\nDuring the party people started chatting. Due to the way $\\sim $s is programmed once people start chatting they can\u2019t stop. So as time goes on people get added to conversations but they never leave them. Steadily, groups of people chatting start to form and a person from one group can\u2019t join another without the groups merging.\n\nBjarki is starting to get bored watching this process so he starts counting the size of the groups. But every person is so small on the screen it\u2019s actually easier for him to notice the speechbubble form, which indicate a merger of groups. Bjarki gives you two different types of queries. One indicates a speechbubble and the other means Bjarki wants to know the size of a particular group chat.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^6$, $n$ denoting the total amount of guests at the party and $q$ denoting the amount of queries. Then $q$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains either contains \u2018t\u2019 and two integers $1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$ or \u2018s\u2019 and one integer $1 \\leq a \\leq n$. If the line begins with \u2018t\u2019 it indicates that the groups guest $a$ and guest $b$ belong to merge and if the line begins with \u2018s\u2019 you should print the size of the group guest $a$ belongs to.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should contain one line containing one integer for each query of the \u2018s\u2019 type indicating the size of the specified group.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 11\nt 1 10\nt 1 2\nt 1 3\ns 1\ns 2\ns 3\ns 4\nt 5 6\ns 5\ns 6\ns 10\nSample Output:\n4\n4\n4\n1\n2\n2\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
