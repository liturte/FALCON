You have to form a team consisting of $k$ students ($1 \\le k \\le n$) such that the ratings of all team members are distinct.\n\nIf it is impossible to form a suitable team, print \"NO\" (without quotes). Otherwise print \"YES\", and then print $k$ distinct numbers which should be the indices of students in the team you form. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of students and the size of the team you have to form.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$), where $a_i$ is the rating of $i$-th student.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to form a suitable team, print \"NO\" (without quotes). Otherwise print \"YES\", and then print $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ which should be the indices of students in the team you form. All the ratings of the students in the team should be distinct. You may print the indices in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n15 13 15 15 12\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 5 \n\nInput\n5 4\n15 13 15 15 12\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4 4\n20 10 40 30\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 3 4 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nAll possible answers for the first example:   {1 2 5}  {2 3 5}  {2 4 5} \n\nNote that the order does not matter.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
