Since Takahashi can make X takoyaki at a time, the time needed to make N takoyaki can be calculated by dividing N by X (the quotient) and then multiplying it by T. However, if N is not a multiple of X, we need to round up because we can't make a fraction of a takoyaki. This can be done using integer division (//) with an extra step to round up.\n\nIn Python, the expression `(a + b - 1) // b` will round up `a` to the nearest multiple of `b`. So, `(N + X - 1) // X` will give us the quotient of N divided by X, rounded up, which is the number of times Takahashi can make takoyaki. We then", "N, X, T = map(int, input().split())\nprint((N + X - 1) // X * T)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe number of takoyaki Takahashi can make in a time period is determined by the integer division of the total number of takoyaki by the number of takoyaki he can make in a time period. This gives us the number of time periods he can make takoyaki. Multiplying this by the length of a time period gives us the total time. \n\nThe expression `(N + X - 1) // X` is used to round up the division, as you can't make a fraction of a takoyaki.\n\nIn the provided sample input, Takahashi can make 12 takoyaki in the first 6 minutes and 8 more in the next 6 minutes, so he can make 20 takoyaki in a total of 12 minutes.\n\nThis solution works by directly applying the mathematical formula for the problem, without needing to", "N, X, T = map(int, input().split())\nprint((N + X - 1) // X * T)\n\n\nThis solution works by rounding up the division of N by X (which gives the number of batches of X takoyaki he can make) and multiplying by T (the time it takes to make one batch). The rounding up is done by adding X - 1 to the denominator and then dividing by X, which is equivalent to integer division with rounding up (// operator in Python).\n\nFor example, if N = 20, X = 12, T = 6, the expression (N + X - 1) // X * T is computed as (20 + 12 - 1) // 12 * 6, which equals 2 * 6 = 12.\n\"\"\"\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# SAMPLE I/O\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# Input: 20 12 6\n# Output: 12\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n# Input: 10", "import sys\n\ndef main():\n    N, X, T = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    print((N + X - 1) // X * T)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nThis solution uses the integer division `//` to compute the minimum number of times Takahashi can make takoyaki in the given time. It rounds up the result because the machine can't make a fraction of a takoyaki.\n\nThis solution works by first calculating the number of full cycles of takoyaki Takahashi can make by dividing N by X and rounding up. Then, it multiplies this number by T to find the total time.\n\nThe expression `(N + X - 1) // X` is equivalent to `N // X`, but it rounds up instead of down, which is what we need in this case because we can't make a fraction of a takoyaki.\n\nIn Python, `a // b` performs integer (floor", "import sys\n\nN, X, T = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nminutes = (N // X) * T\nif N % X > 0:\n    minutes += T\n\nprint(minutes)\n\n\nIn this solution, we first calculate how many times he can make X pieces of takoyaki in T minutes. This is done by integer division (//) and then multiplying by T.\n\nThen we check if there are any remaining pieces of takoyaki that cannot fit into X. If there are, we add T to the total time again.\n\nFinally, we print the total time.\n\nThis solution assumes that N is always greater than or equal to X. If X is 0, the program will raise a division by zero error.\n\nThis solution works by repeatedly dividing N by X and multiplying the result by T until N is less than X. The remainder of the division is the number of takoyaki that cannot fit into X, and these are added to the total time.\n\nThis solution has"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi loves takoyaki - a ball-shaped snack.\nWith a takoyaki machine, he can make at most X pieces of takoyaki at a time, taking T minutes regardless of the number of pieces to make.\nHow long does it take to make N takoyaki?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N,X,T \\leq 1000\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X T\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint an integer representing the minimum number of minutes needed to make N pieces of takoyaki.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n20 12 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n12\n\nHe can make 12 pieces of takoyaki in the first 6 minutes and 8 more in the next 6 minutes, so he can make 20 in a total of 12 minutes.\nNote that being able to make 12 in 6 minutes does not mean he can make 2 in 1 minute.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
