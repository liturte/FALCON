In the game, each of the players uses their hand to show one of three symbols: rock, paper or scissors. If both players show the same symbol, the game is a tie. Otherwise, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock and rock beats scissors.\n\nSven has been studying the psychological intricacies of the game for years and has become a real master at the game, his friends not standing a chance against him in one-on-one games.\n\nWith the world championships around the corner, Sven is practicing his skills playing simultaneous games with $N$ of his friends. One such game consists of $R$ rounds. In each round, Sven and each of his friends show one of the three symbols.\n\nWhen calculating the score, in each round, Sven\u2019s symbol is independently compared to each of his friends\u2019 symbols. Sven scores two points for every win and one point for every tie. Sven does not get points for losing.\n\nWrite a program that calculates Sven\u2019s total score, and also his largest possible score had he known in advance all the symbols his friends would show.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $R$ ($1 \\le R \\le 50$), the number of rounds played.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019. The string represents symbols that Sven showed in each round. \u2018S\u2019 is for scissors, \u2018P\u2019 for paper, \u2018R\u2019 for rock.\n\nThe third line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 50$), the number of friends.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains a string of $R$ letters \u2018S\u2019, \u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019. These are the symbols shown by each of the $N$ friends in each of the $R$ rounds.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput Sven\u2019s actual score on the first line.\n\nOutput his largest possible score on the second line, assuming his friends didn\u2019t change their symbols.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\nSSPPR\n1\nSSPPR\nSample Output 1:\n5\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\nSSPPR\n2\nPPRRS\nRRSSP\nSample Output 2:\n10\n15\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
