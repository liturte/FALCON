Then, it iterates through the array, decreasing each monster's health by 1 if it's greater than the previous monster's health. The maximum of the current health and the previous health minus 1 is used to ensure that the monster's health doesn't go below 1. The final health of the last monster alive is then returned.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(n", "import heapq\n\ndef last_monster_health():\n    n = int(input())\n    health = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    health = [-h for h in health]\n    heapq.heapify(health)\n    while len(health) > 1:\n        a = heapq.heappop(health)\n        b = heapq.heappop(health)\n        if a < b:\n            heapq.heappush(health, a-b)\n        else:\n            heapq.heappush(health, b-a)\n    return -health[0]\n\nprint(last_monster_health())\n\n\nThis solution uses a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the health of the monsters.
