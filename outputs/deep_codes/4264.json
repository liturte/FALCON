If so, it simply prints N because all numbers from 1 to N inclusive have an odd number of digits.\n\nIf N is 10 or greater, it initializes a count variable to 9 (the count of numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive that have an odd number of digits). It also initializes a digit variable to 2 (the number of digits in 10), and a base variable to 10 (the smallest number with 2 digits).\n\nThe code then enters a loop that continues as long as the base is less than or equal to N. In each iteration of the loop, it adds to the count the number of integers from base to N inclusive that have an odd number of digits. The number of such integers is (N - base + 1). The base variable is then doubled, and the digit variable is incremented by 2.\n\nFinally, the code prints the count.\n\nThis code works because the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have an odd number of digits is equal to the", "N = int(input())\n\ndef count_numbers(n):\n    if n < 10:\n        return n\n    if n < 100:\n        return 9 + (n - 9)\n    if n < 1000:\n        return 9 + (n - 99)\n    if n < 10000:\n        return 9 + (n - 999)\n    if n < 100000:\n        return 9 + (n - 9999)\n\nprint(count_numbers(N))\n\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that for an integer with d digits, there are d - 1 even digits and d - 1 odd digits. So, the number of integers with an odd number of digits is 10^d - 10^(d-1). We use the properties of exponents to simplify the calculation.\n\nFor example, for a number with 2 digits, the number of integers with an odd number of digits is 10^2 - 10^1 = 90. For a number with 3 digits, the number of integers with an odd number of digits is 10^3 - 10^2 = 900. And so on.\n\nThis solution works for numbers up to 10^5, which is the maximum value of N given in the problem constraints.", "N = int(input())\n\n# Count of numbers with odd number of digits from 1 to 9\ncount = N // 10 * 5\n\n# If the last digit of N is greater than or equal to 5, add 5 to the count\nif N % 10 >= 5:\n    count += 5\n\n# Subtract 1 from the count if N is even\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    count -= 1\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis solution works by first calculating the count of numbers with odd number of digits from 1 to 9. This is done by dividing N by 10 and multiplying by 5. If the last digit of N is greater than or equal to 5, 5 is added to the count. If N is even, 1 is subtracted from the count because it is not counted in the previous step.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it runs in constant time regardless of the size of N.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that for numbers with odd number of digits, the number of digits is always odd. This is because the count of numbers with odd number of digits from 1 to 9 is always 5, and the count of numbers with even number of digits from 1 to 9 is always 4.\n\nThis solution also works for N up to 10^5, which is the maximum limit given in the", "N = int(input())\n\n# Calculate the number of integers with odd number of digits\n# for numbers up to 9 (which have 1 digit)\n# for numbers up to 99 (which have 2 digits)\n# for numbers up to 999 (which have 3 digits)\n# for numbers up to 9999 (which have 4 digits)\n# and so on...\n# The pattern is that the number of integers with odd number of digits is 5 times the number of integers with even number of digits\n# and 1 more than the number of integers with odd number of digits in the previous group\n\nodd_count = 1  # 1 integer with 1 digit\neven_count = 0  # 0 integers with 0 digits\ngroup_size = 10  # The size of the current group of integers\n\nwhile group_size <= N:\n    next_odd_count = odd_count * 5 + even_count * 2 + 1\n    next_even_count = odd_count * 2 + even_count * 5\n    odd_count = next_odd_count\n    even_count = next_even_count\n    group_size *= 10\n\n# Subtract the number of integers with even number of digits\n# that are greater than N from the total count\nif group_size > N:\n    odd_count -= (group_size"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is an integer N.
