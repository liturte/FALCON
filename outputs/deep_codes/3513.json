It then counts the number of unique factors, which corresponds to the number of points the second player can get. The reason we use a set to count the unique factors is because each factor can appear multiple times in the factorization of `x`, and we want to count each factor only once.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the first player always uses a number that can be factored into distinct prime factors. In practice, this assumption may not hold for all inputs, but it is generally true for numbers in the range specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(sqrt(n)) because in the worst case, it factors the number into its prime factors.

The prime factorization is used to find the factors of the number. The number is divided by the prime factors until it becomes 1. The number of prime factors found is the number of points.\n\nThis is an optimal solution because it uses the smallest number of points to factorize the largest possible number. It's a classic problem in number theory, known as the prime factorization. The prime factorization is the most efficient method for finding the prime factors of a number.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(sqrt(n)) because in the worst case we need to check up to the square root of the number to find its factors.

The number of factors found in this way is the number of points the second player can get.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because in the worst case, the program needs to iterate up to the square root of the number to find all of its prime factors. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of factors found, as the factors are stored in a list.\n\nThis program assumes that the input number is a positive integer and that it is within the", "import math\n\ndef min_points(x):\n    factors = []\n    i = 1\n    while i <= math.isqrt(x):\n        if x % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            factors.append(x//i)\n        i += 1\n    factors = list(set(factors))\n    factors.sort()\n    for f in factors:\n        if f*(f+1) == x:\n            return 1\n        elif f*(f+1)*(f+2) == x:\n            return 2\n        elif f*(f+1)*(f+2)*(f+3) == x:\n            return 3\n        elif f*(f+1)*(f+2)*(f+3)*(f+4) == x:\n            return 4\n        elif f*(f+1)*(f+2)*(f+3)*(f+4)*(f+5) == x:\n            return 5\n        elif f*(f+1)*(f+2)*(f+3)*(f+4)*(f+5)*(f+6) == x:\n            return 6\n        elif f*(f+", "def min_points(x):\n    factors = []\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= x:\n        if x % i:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            x //= i\n            factors.append(i)\n    if x > 1:\n        factors.append(x)\n    return len(set(factors))\n\nprint(min_points(int(input())))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses the prime factorization of the input number to find the factors. Then it counts the unique factors, which gives the number of points. The prime factorization is used to find the factors because it is the most efficient way to find the factors of a number. The factors are found by dividing the number by the smallest prime that evenly divides it, and then repeating this process until the number is 1. The factors are stored in a list, and then the list is converted to a set to remove duplicate factors. The length of the set is then returned, which gives the number of points.\n\nThe prime factorization works by repeatedly dividing the number by its smallest prime factor.
