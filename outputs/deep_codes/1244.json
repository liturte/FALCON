It then checks if the number of unique elements in the array is equal to the number of elements in the array. If they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The set data structure in Python only contains unique elements, so by converting the array to a set, we can easily count the number of unique elements.\n\nThis solution works because in order for Yaroslav to be able to swap the elements in such a way that", "n = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif len(set(a)) == len(a):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nThis program reads the number of elements and the elements themselves from the input. It then checks if the length of the set of the elements (which removes duplicates) is equal to the length of the list. If they are equal, it means that all elements are distinct, and Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs in a finite time. If they are not equal, it means that there are duplicate elements, and Yaroslav cannot obtain the array he needs in a finite time.\n\nThis solution has a", "n = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif len(set(a)) == n:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\nThis solution works by first taking the input and converting it into a set. A set in python is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. It is written with curly brackets, and it has no duplicate values. By converting the list into a set, we are removing any duplicate values from the array. Then, we simply check if the length of the set is equal to the length of the original array. If it is, it means that all elements in the array are distinct, so we print 'YES'. If the", "n = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(\"YES\" if len(set(a)) == n else \"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program first reads the number of elements n and the array a. It then checks if the length of the set of the array is equal to n. The set in Python is a data type that only contains unique elements. Therefore, if the length of the set is equal to n, it means that all elements in the array are distinct, and Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs. Otherwise, he can't. The result is then printed.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYaroslav has an array that consists of n integers. In one second Yaroslav can swap two neighboring array elements. Now Yaroslav is wondering if he can obtain an array where any two neighboring elements would be distinct in a finite time.\n\nHelp Yaroslav.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000) \u2014 the array elements.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n4\n7 7 7 7\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the initial array fits well.\n\nIn the second sample Yaroslav can get array: 1, 2, 1.
