It reads the lengths of the sides from the standard input, calculates the area, and prints the result.\n\nNote: The area of a right triangle is calculated as `1/2 * base * height`. In this case, the base is `AB` and the height is `BC`.\n\nThis code is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language. It is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a popular choice for many applications, including web and desktop applications.\n\nThe `sys.stdin.readline()` function reads a line from the standard input. The `map()` function applies the `int()` function to each element of the input line, converting them all to integers. The `print()` function outputs the area of the triangle.\n\nThe `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which discards the fractional part and only keeps the integer part of the division result.
