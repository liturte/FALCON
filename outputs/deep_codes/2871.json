Each team consists of $K$ students. The excited students, $N$ of them, are waiting in queue to register.\n\nKre\u0161o works at the registration desk. He doesn\u2019t really feel like doing his job so he decided not to allow students to choose a team. He decided that the first team will consist of the first $K$ students standing in queue, the second team the following $K$ students, the third one the following $K$ students and so on\u2026($N$ will be divisible by $K$ so nobody is left hanging.)\n\nAnte has estimated the skill of each player with an integer. He would like to have the $K$ strongest players in the first team, the following $K$ strongest in the second team and so on\u2026\n\nKre\u0161o has just taken a break and Ante decided to shift the students standing in queue so that he achieves his goal. The way he shifts them is that he tells a student to step out of the queue and go back in queue after another student or to go to the front of the queue. It takes him one minute to do this.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Kre\u0161o is going to return from his break any moment so Ante needs to achieve his goal as soon as possible. Help Ante determine the minimal number of minutes necessary for him to achieve his goal.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 100000)$. The integer $N$ is going to divisible by $K$.\n\nThe second line contains $N$ space separated integers $v_ i$ ($1 \\leq v_ i \\leq 10^9$), the $i$-th number denotes the skill of the $i$-th player standing in queue \u2013 lower value means higher skill.\n\nAll contestants are going to have distinct levels of skill.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the minimal required number of minutes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 1\n9 12 5 13\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 2\n16 2 1 7 5 10\nSample Output 2:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
