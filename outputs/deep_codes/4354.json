Thus, the first line in the output should contain 2.\nThe Manhattan distance between the second student and each checkpoint is:\n - For checkpoint 1: |0-(-1)|+|0-0|=1\n - For checkpoint 2: |0-1|+|0-0|=1\nWhen there are multiple nearest checkpoints, the student will go to the checkpoint with the smallest index. Thus, the second line in the output should contain 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
