{"4366": {"code": ["A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `map` function to convert the input strings to integers. It then uses the modulus operator (`%`) to ensure that the result is a valid 24-hour time. If the sum of A and B is greater than 24, the modulus operator will wrap the result around to the start of the day.\n\nFor example, if A is 9 and B is 12, the sum is 21. But since 24 is the number of hours in a day, the modulus operator will wrap this result to 21, which is the 9:00 p.m. time in 24-hour time.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the inputs will always be valid. If you want to handle invalid inputs, you will need to add error checking code.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nThis program reads two integers A and B from the standard input. It calculates the sum of A and B and takes the modulo 24 of this sum. This gives the hour of the starting time of the contest in 24-hour time. It then prints this hour.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"9 12\", the program calculates (9 + 12) mod 24 to get 21, and prints this value, which is \"21\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not include any error checking or handling.\n\nPlease note that this solution is written in Python and may not work in other programming languages.\n\"\"\"\n\n# SOLUTION:\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nThis program reads two integers A and B from the standard input. It calculates the sum of A and B and takes the modulo 24 of this sum. This gives the hour", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is straightforward. It reads the current time (A) and the number of hours until the contest starts (B) from the input. It then adds these two values together, and takes the modulus 24 to ensure that the result is within the range 0-23. This result is the hour of the day at which the contest will start. The modulus operation ensures that if the sum of A and B is greater than 23, it wraps around to the start of the day, as is the case in a 24-hour clock.\n\nThis solution works because the modulus operation effectively 'wraps' the result of the addition back around to the start of the day if it exceeds 23. The result of the addition is then the hour of the day at which the contest starts.\n\nFor example, if it is currently 9 o'clock and the contest starts in 12 hours (21 o'clock), the solution would output 21.\n\nThis solution also handles the", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nThis Python code takes two inputs A and B, where A is the current hour and B is the number of hours after which the contest will start. The code then calculates the hour of the starting time of the contest by adding A and B and taking the modulus of 24. The result is printed out.\n\nIn the given example, A=9 and B=12, so the code calculates (9+12)%24 = 21, and prints 21.\n\nNote: The modulus operator (%) is used to ensure that the result is within the range 0-23, as in a 24-hour clock.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nThis code will solve the problem as required.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Code:\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B) % 24)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses the modulus operator to handle the case where the sum of A and B exceeds 24. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the number by 24, so if the sum is greater than 24, it will \"wrap around\" to the start of the day.\n\nFor example, if A is 22 and B is 4, the sum is 26. But in 24-hour time, it would be 2 o'clock (26 mod 24).\n\nSo, the solution is to print the result of (A + B) mod 24.\n\nThis solution assumes that A and B are non-negative integers, as per the problem constraints.\n\nPlease note that this solution is written in Python.\n\nAlso, this solution doesn't handle the case where A and B are not integers. The problem constraints specify that A and B are integers, so this is assumed in the solution.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the inputs"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nDolphin loves programming contests.
