It does this by summing the cost of each banana (which is i*k where i is the number of the banana) for i from 1 to w (inclusive). \n\nThen, it calculates the amount of money the soldier needs to borrow by subtracting the amount of money he initially has from the total cost. If the soldier doesn't need to borrow any money (i.e., he has enough money to buy all the bananas), the borrow variable will be 0. \n\nFinally, it prints the borrow variable. If the borrow is negative (which would mean the soldier has enough money), it prints 0 instead.\n\nThis program does not use any conditionals or loops that could be used to solve the problem in a different way.

Then, it checks if the soldier has enough money to buy all the bananas. If the total cost is greater than the amount of money the soldier has, he needs to borrow money, which is calculated by subtracting the soldier's money from the total cost. If the soldier has enough money, he doesn't need to borrow, so the solution prints 0.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it calculates the total cost of the bananas in one pass and checks if the soldier needs to borrow money in constant time.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input will be in the correct format as described in the problem statement.\n\nIf you have any questions about this solution, feel free to ask.", "k, n, w = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_cost = sum(i*k for i in range(1, w+1))\nborrow = total_cost - n\nprint(borrow if borrow > 0 else 0)\n\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of the bananas the soldier wants to buy, and then subtracts the number of dollars the soldier already has. If the result is positive, that means the soldier needs to borrow money, and the program prints that amount.

The total cost of all bananas is the sum of these costs, which is calculated by the sum function and generator expression. \n\nThen, we calculate how much money the soldier has to borrow by subtracting his initial number of dollars from the total cost. If the soldier doesn't have to borrow money (i.e., his initial number of dollars is greater or equal to the total cost), we print 0. Otherwise, we print the borrowed money.\n\nThe condition borrowed_money > 0 is used to ensure that we don't print negative numbers.\n\nThe input() function reads a line from input, and the", "k, n, w = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_cost = sum(i*k for i in range(1, w+1))\nborrow = total_cost - n\nprint(borrow if borrow > 0 else 0)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe soldier has to pay k dollars for the first banana, 2k dollars for the second one, 3k dollars for the third one, and so on. The total cost of buying w bananas is the sum of the costs of the first w bananas. We calculate this sum using a generator expression and the built-in sum() function.\n\nThe soldier's initial amount of money is n dollars. If the soldier has enough money to buy w bananas, the total cost of the bananas will be less than n. We calculate the amount of money the soldier must borrow by subtracting his initial amount of money from the total cost. If the soldier doesn't have to borrow money, we print 0. Otherwise, we print the amount of money he must borrow.\n\nWe use the ternary operator to conditionally print the borrow amount or 0, depending on whether the borrow amount"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nA soldier wants to buy w bananas in the shop.
