The second word is the prefix of the third word, so the are in lexicographical order. As the first letters of the third and the fourth words are the same, and 3' < 1, then the third word is not lexicographically larger than the fourth word.\n\nIn the second example the words are in lexicographical order from the beginning, so Denis can do nothing.\n\nIn the third example there is no set of letters such that if Denis capitalizes them, the sequence becomes lexicographically ordered.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
