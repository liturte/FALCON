The entry in the i-th row and j-th column of this matrix is denoted as a_{i, j}. This matrix contains each of 1, 2, \\dots, N^2 exactly once.\nSigma can repeat the following two kinds of operation arbitrarily many times in any order.\n - Pick two integers x, y (1 \\leq x < y \\leq N) that satisfy a_{i, x} + a_{i, y} \\leq K for all i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) and swap the x-th and the y-th columns.\n - Pick two integers x, y (1 \\leq x < y \\leq N) that satisfy a_{x, i} + a_{y, i} \\leq K for all i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) and swap the x-th and the y-th rows.\nHow many matrices can he obtain by these operations? Find it modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 50\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 2 \\times N^2\n - a_{i, j}'s are a rearrangement of 1, 2, \\dots, N^2.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\na_{1, 1} a_{1, 2} ... a_{1, N}\na_{2, 1} a_{2, 2} ... a_{2, N}\n:\na_{N, 1} a_{N, 2} ... a_{N, N}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of matrices Sigma can obtain modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 13\n3 2 7\n4 8 9\n1 6 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n12\n\nFor example, Sigma can swap two columns, by setting x = 1, y = 2. After that, the resulting matrix will be:\n2 3 7\n8 4 9\n6 1 5\n\nAfter that, he can swap two row vectors by setting x = 1, y = 3, resulting in the following matrix:\n6 1 5\n8 4 9\n2 3 7\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
