{"2340": {"code": ["QUESTION:\nYou are playing a game where your character should overcome different obstacles. The current problem is to come down from a cliff. The cliff has height $h$, and there is a moving platform on each height $x$ from $1$ to $h$.\n\nEach platform is either hidden inside the cliff or moved out. At first, there are $n$ moved out platforms on heights $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$.

In other words, the platform you are currently standing on will hide in the cliff and the platform one unit below will change it state: it will hide if it was moved out or move out if it was hidden. In the second case, you will safely land on it. Note that this is the only way to move from one platform to another.\n\nYour character is quite fragile, so it can safely fall from the height no more than $2$. In other words falling from the platform $x$ to platform $x - 2$ is okay, but falling from $x$ to $x - 3$ (or lower) is certain death. \n\nSometimes it's not possible to come down from the cliff, but you can always buy (for donate currency) several magic crystals.
