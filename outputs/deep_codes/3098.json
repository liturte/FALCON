Her cake can be described by a convex polygon with $n$ vertices. No three vertices are collinear.\n\nAlice will now choose exactly $k$ random vertices ($k{\\ge }3$) from her cake and cut a piece, the shape of which is the convex polygon defined by those vertices. Compute the expected area of this piece of cake.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach test case will begin with a line with two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($3\\! \\le \\! k\\! \\le \\! n\\! \\le \\! 2500$), where $n$ is the number of vertices of the cake, and $k$ is the number of vertices of the piece that Alice cuts.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines will contain two space-separated real numbers $x$ and $y$ ($-10.0{\\le }x,y{\\le }10.0$), where $(x,y)$ is a vertex of the cake. The vertices will be listed in clockwise order. No three vertices will be collinear. All real numbers have at most $6$ digits after the decimal point.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single real number, which is the expected area of the piece of cake that Alice cuts out. Your answer will be accepted if it is within an absolute error of $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n0 0\n1 1\n2 1\n1 0\nSample Output 1:\n0.50000000\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 5\n0 4\n4 2\n4 1\n3 -1\n-2 4\nSample Output 2:\n12.50000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
