The string section is arranged in an r \u00d7 c rectangular grid and is filled with violinists with the exception of n violists. Paul really likes violas, so he would like to take a picture including at least k of them. Paul can take a picture of any axis-parallel rectangle in the orchestra. Count the number of possible pictures that Paul can take.\n\nTwo pictures are considered to be different if the coordinates of corresponding rectangles are different.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains four space-separated integers r, c, n, k (1 \u2264 r, c, n \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the string section, the total number of violas, and the minimum number of violas Paul would like in his photograph, respectively.\n\nThe next n lines each contain two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 r, 1 \u2264 y_{i} \u2264 c): the position of the i-th viola. It is guaranteed that no location appears more than once in the input.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of photographs Paul can take which include at least k violas. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3 2 3 3\n1 1\n3 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 2 3 2\n1 1\n3 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWe will use '*' to denote violinists and '#' to denote violists.\n\nIn the first sample, the orchestra looks as follows \n\n*#\n\n**\n\n Paul can take a photograph of just the viola, the 1 \u00d7 2 column containing the viola, the 2 \u00d7 1 row containing the viola, or the entire string section, for 4 pictures total.\n\nIn the second sample, the orchestra looks as follows \n\n#*\n\n*#\n\n#*\n\n Paul must take a photograph of the entire section.\n\nIn the third sample, the orchestra looks the same as in the second sample.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
