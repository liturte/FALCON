To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table $M$ with $n$ rows and $n$ columns such that $M_{ij}=a_i \\cdot a_j$ where $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ is some sequence of positive integers.\n\nOf course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array $a_1, \\dots, a_n$. Help Sasha restore the array!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 10^3$), the size of the table. \n\nThe next $n$ lines contain $n$ integers each. The $j$-th number of the $i$-th line contains the number $M_{ij}$ ($1 \\leq M_{ij} \\leq 10^9$). The table has zeroes on the main diagonal, that is, $M_{ii}=0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print $n$ integers, the original array $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$). It is guaranteed that an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n0 4 6 2 4\n4 0 6 2 4\n6 6 0 3 6\n2 2 3 0 2\n4 4 6 2 0\n\nOutput\n2 2 3 1 2 \nInput\n3\n0 99990000 99970002\n99990000 0 99980000\n99970002 99980000 0\n\nOutput\n9999 10000 9998\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
