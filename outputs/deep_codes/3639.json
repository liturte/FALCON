First you look up the rain radar image that shows you precisely the predicted intensity of rainfall in the upcoming hours. You know at what time you want to be home at the latest. Also, you came up with a good estimate of how much you sweat depending on your cycling speed. Now the question remains: what is the best strategy to get home as dry as possible?\n\nThe rain is given for each minute interval in millilitres, indicating how wet you get from cycling through this \u2014 note that you can cycle just a fraction of a whole minute interval at the start and end of your trip: then only that fraction of the rain during that interval affects you. Sweating makes you wet at a rate of $s = c \\cdot v^2$ per minute where $v$ is your speed in $\\mathrm{km}/\\mathrm{h}$ and $c$ is a positive constant you have determined. You have to cover the distance to your home in a given time (you don\u2019t want to wait forever for it to become dry), but otherwise you can choose your strategy of when to leave and how fast to cycle (and even change speeds) as you wish.
