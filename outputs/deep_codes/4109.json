The basic idea is to maintain a dp array where dp[i] is the maximum understanding level he can achieve with i yen. We iterate over all books and for each book, we update the dp array by considering whether it's worth buying the book. We only update dp[i] if it's better to spend j yen and get dp[i - j] + algo[0] understanding level. The answer is the maximum value in dp that is greater than or equal to X.\n\nThe", "import heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    N, M, X = map(int, input().split())\n    books = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n    books.sort()\n    q = [0] * M\n    total = 0\n    for c, a in books:\n        if any(q[j] < X for j in range(M)):\n            i = next(j for j in range(M) if q[j] < X)\n            total += c\n            q[i] = max(q[i], a)\n        else:\n            break\n    return (total if all(q[j] >= X for j in range(M)) else 'No')\n\nprint(solve())\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a greedy algorithm that uses a priority queue (heap) to track the understanding level of the M algorithms. The books are sorted by their cost, and for each book, if there is at least one algorithm whose understanding level is less than X, Takahashi buys the book and increases the understanding level of the corresponding algorithm. The total cost is updated accordingly. If all the algorithms have their understanding level at least X, the objective is achievable; otherwise, it is not.\n\nNote that the", "import sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    N, M, X = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    books = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n    books.sort()\n    que = []\n    total = 0\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(N):\n        while j < M and books[j][0] <= total:\n            heapq.heappush(que, books[j][1])\n            j += 1\n        if que:\n            total += heapq.heappop(que)\n        elif i < N-1:\n            return \"No\"\n    return \"Yes\" if total >= X*M else \"No\"\n\nprint(solve())\n\nThis code uses a priority queue to select the book with the highest increase in understanding level. If there are no books available, it checks if the total understanding level is sufficient. If it is, it returns \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\".\n\nPlease note that this code should be run in an environment that supports the `heapq` module and `sys.stdin.readline()` function, such as Python's interactive console or a script run in a terminal.\n\nAlso, the input", "import heapq\n\ndef solve(M, N, X, C, A):\n    books = sorted((c, a) for c, *a in zip(C, *A))\n    hq = []\n    total = 0\n    for c, a in books:\n        total += c\n        heapq.heappush(hq, -a[0])\n        if len(hq) > M:\n            total += heapq.heappop(hq)\n        if len(hq) == M and -sum(hq) >= X:\n            return total\n    return 'Impossible'\n\nM, N, X = map(int, input().split())\nC = list(map(int, input().split()))\nA = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\nprint(solve(M, N, X, C, A))\n\n\nThis is a python program that uses a heap to solve the problem. It starts by sorting the books by their price in ascending order. Then it iterates over the sorted books, adding their price to the total and pushing their algorithm levels into the heap. If the heap's size exceeds M, it pops the smallest element from the heap.
