It reads the last digit of the input using `input()[-1]`, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and uses it as an index to access the corresponding pronunciation from the list.\n\nThe list `['bon', 'hon', 'pon', 'bon', 'pon', 'bon', 'pon', 'hon', 'hon', 'bon']` contains the pronunciations for the digits 0-9. The index of this list is the last digit of the input, which is converted to an integer using `int()", "n = int(input())\nones_digit = n % 10\nif ones_digit in [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]:\n    print(\"hon\")\nelif ones_digit in [0, 1, 6, 8]:\n    print(\"pon\")\nelse:\n    print(\"bon\")\n\n\nThis code reads an integer from the input, calculates the ones digit of the number, and then prints the pronunciation of \"\u672c\" based on the ones digit.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the input is a positive integer not exceeding 999. If the input is not within this range, the code may not behave as expected.", "N = int(input())\n\nif N % 10 in [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]:\n    print('hon')\nelif N % 10 in [0, 1, 6, 8]:\n    print('pon')\nelse:\n    print('bon')\n\n\nThis code takes an input number, N, and checks the last digit of N by finding the remainder when N is divided by 10 (N % 10). It then checks which of the three options (hon, pon, bon) corresponds to the last digit and prints that option.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will always be a positive integer not exceeding 999, as per the problem statement.\n\nIt's important to note that this code uses Python's `if`, `elif` and `else", "N = int(input())\nif N % 10 in [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]:\n    print('hon')\nelif N % 10 in [0, 1, 6, 8]:\n    print('pon')\nelse:\n    print('bon')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads an integer `N` from standard input. It then uses the modulus operator `%` to get the last digit of `N` (i.e., the digit in the one's place of `N`). It checks this digit against the lists of digits that correspond to 'hon', 'pon', and 'bon' in Japanese. If the digit matches one of the first list, it prints 'hon'. If it matches one of the second list, it prints 'pon'. If it doesn't match", "N = int(input())\nif N % 10 in [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]:\n    print('hon')\nelif N % 10 in [0, 1, 6, 8]:\n    print('pon')\nelse:\n    print('bon')\n\n\nThis program reads an integer from the standard input, determines the last digit of the number, and then prints the appropriate string based on the value of the last digit. The % operator is used to get the last digit of the number, and the in keyword is used to check if the last digit is in a certain list of values."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe cat Snuke wants to play a popular Japanese game called \u00c5tCoder, so Iroha has decided to teach him Japanese.\nWhen counting pencils in Japanese, the counter word \"\u672c\" follows the number. The pronunciation of this word varies depending on the number. Specifically, the pronunciation of \"\u672c\" in the phrase \"N \u672c\" for a positive integer N not exceeding 999 is as follows:\n - hon when the digit in the one's place of N is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9;\n - pon when the digit in the one's place of N is 0, 1, 6 or 8;\n - bon when the digit in the one's place of N is 3.\nGiven N, print the pronunciation of \"\u672c\" in the phrase \"N \u672c\".\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is a positive integer not exceeding 999.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n16\n\n-----Sample Output-----\npon\n\nThe digit in the one's place of 16 is 6, so the \"\u672c\" in \"16 \u672c\" is pronounced pon.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
