The cost of this operation is D \\times C_i, where D is the number of integers j such that S_j \\neq T_j (1 \\leq j \\leq N) just before this change.\nThere are 2^N \\times (2^N - 1) pairs (S, T) of different sequences of length N consisting of 0 and 1. Compute the sum of f(S, T) over all of those pairs, modulo (10^9+7).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^9\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nC_1 C_2 \\cdots C_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the sum of f(S, T), modulo (10^9+7).\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n1000000000\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n999999993\n\nThere are two pairs (S, T) of different sequences of length 2 consisting of 0 and 1, as follows:\n - S = (0), T = (1): by changing S_1 to 1, we can have S = T at the cost of 1000000000, so f(S, T) = 1000000000.\n - S = (1), T = (0): by changing S_1 to 0, we can have S = T at the cost of 1000000000, so f(S, T) = 1000000000.\nThe sum of these is 2000000000, and we should print it modulo (10^9+7), that is, 999999993.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
