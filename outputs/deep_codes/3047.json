To find lost pets, students have to infiltrate a world of monsters and solve puzzles! Implemented by a professional game studio, these puzzles are quite engaging and challenging.\n\nIn the manager\u2019s cafeteria, students are asked to practice proportions by serving $5$ monsters sitting at the table: Salamander, Yeti, Golem, Imp, and Kraken. Each monster wants some amount of burger, slop, sushi, and drumstick.\n\nThe amount of each item each monster wants on their plate is proportional to the amount of each of the other items that monster wants, and the proportionality ratio is the same for all monsters.\n\nFor instance, as shown in sample input $1$ and in the accompanying figure, if Golem (center) wants $6$ units of burger on his plate and $12$ units of drumstick, and Salamander (left) wants $40$ units of drumstick, then Salamander will want $20$ units of burger. Students practicing proportions will program the dispenser machine to release $20$ units of burger. Similarly, Kraken (right) wants $36$ units of drumstick because it has $81$ units of slop on its plate and Salamander has $40$ units of drumstick and $90$ units of slop.

The first line describes the top row (burgers and slop), the second line describes the bottom row (sushi and drumstick). On each line, the first $2$ entries describe Salamander\u2019s plate, the next $2$ Yeti\u2019s, then Golem\u2019s, Imp\u2019s, and finally Kraken\u2019s.
