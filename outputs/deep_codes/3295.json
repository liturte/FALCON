At the beginning of the game, they pick three numbers $K$, $L$, $M$. In the first and only step of the game, each of them picks their own $K$ consecutive integers.\n\nSlavko always picks the first $K$ integers (numbers $1, 2, \\ldots , K$). Mirko has a special demand\u2014he wants to choose his numbers in a way that there are exactly $L$ happy numbers among them. He considers a number happy if it meets at least one of the following requirements:\n - the number is smaller than or equal to $M$\n - the number is prime\n\nOut of respect to his older brother, $L$ will be smaller than or equal to the total number of happy numbers in Slavko\u2019s array of numbers. They will play a total of $Q$ games with different values $K$, $L$, $M$. For each game, help Mirko find an array that meets his demand.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains $Q$ ($1 \\leq Q \\leq 100000$). Each of the following $Q$ lines contains three integers, the $i$-th line containing integers $K_ i$, $L_ i$, $M_ i$ ($1 \\leq K_ i, M_ i \\leq 150$, $0 \\leq L_ i \\leq K_ i$) that determine the values $K$, $L$, $M$ that will be used in the $i$-th game.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $Q$ lines, the $i$-th line containing an integer, the initial number of Mirko\u2019s array in the $i$-th game. If an array with the initial number being smaller than or equal to $10000000$ does not exist, output $-1$. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 1 1\n2 0 2\n3 1 1\nSample Output 1:\n1\n8\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n4 1 1\n5 2 3\n5 0 3\nSample Output 2:\n6\n4\n24\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
