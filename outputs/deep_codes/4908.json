It then checks if c is equal to the sum, difference, product, or quotient of a and b. If it is, it prints the equation. If it's not, it doesn't print anything. The program does this for all four operations.\n\nNote: The division operation is checked by multiplying b and c and comparing it with a. This is because in Python, the '/' operator performs floating point division and might give a different result than the '//' operator which performs integer division.\n\nAlso, the multiplication operation is checked to ensure neither a nor b is 0 to avoid division by zero error.\n\nThe program uses f-string", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nprint(f\"{a}+{b}={c}\")\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's f-strings to format the output as a string equation. It takes three integers as input, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints the equation `a+b=c` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers.\n\nPlease note that this solution only works for addition. The other three operations (subtraction, multiplication, and division) would require additional logic to handle the order of operations and to ensure that the result of the operation is the third number in the equation.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the input numbers will always be less than 100 as specified in the problem statement.\n\nLastly, the solution will always find a solution as long as the input numbers are distinct and the sum of the first two numbers is less than or equal to 100.\n\nIf the input numbers are not distinct or their sum is greater than 100, the solution will not find a valid equation.\n\nThe solution does not handle errors or invalid inputs.\n\nThis is a simple solution to the problem and does not handle all possible edge cases. It's always a good idea", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\nprint(f'{a}+{b}={c}') if c == a + b else None\nprint(f'{a}-{b}={c}') if c == a - b else None\nprint(f'{a}*{b}={c}') if c == a * b and a != b else None\nprint(f'{a}/{b}={c}') if c * b == a and a % b == 0 else None\n\n\nThis code works by first reading three integers from the input. Then it tries to find the correct equation by checking each operation in turn. If the operation yields the correct result, it prints the equation. The `None` keyword is used to ignore any operations that don't yield the correct result.\n\nFor example, if the input is `5 3 8`, the code will print `5+3=8` because 5 + 3 equals 8.\n\nNote: The division operation is checked first because it may produce a fractional result. The multiplication operation is also checked before addition and subtraction because it can yield the same result.\n\nAlso note that the code assumes that the input integers are distinct. If the input integers are not distinct, the multiplication operation", "def reconstruct_equation(nums):\n    for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if i != j:\n                    if eval(f'{nums[i]}{op}{nums[j]}') == nums[3]:\n                        return f'{nums[i]}{op}{nums[j]}'\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(reconstruct_equation(nums))\n\n\nThis code takes in three numbers and checks all possible combinations of operations to see if the result matches the fourth number. It returns the first valid equation it finds. The `eval` function is used to evaluate the string as a Python expression.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work for division operations where the divisor is zero as it will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n\nAlso, the output of the division operation will be a float number which might not be what you want in some cases. You may need to modify the code to handle this case.\n\nAlso, the code does not handle the case where the input does not have exactly three numbers. You may need to add error handling code to handle this case.\n\nPlease note that the use of `"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nLittle Mirko wrote into his math notebook an equation containing three positive integers, the equals sign and one of the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).\n\nDuring another class, his friend Slavko erased the equals sign and the operations from Mirko\u2019s notebook.
