Each integer point in the grid contains fish. \n\nAt point $(x, y)$, fish first appear at second $t_{x, y}$ and disappear just before time $t_{x, y} + k$ seconds. Outside of this time, no fish can be caught at this position. It takes no time to catch all the fish at a point, and all points contain the same amount of fish. Furthermore, moving to the point immediately north, west, south or east from the point you are currently at takes exactly $1$ second (though you are not required to move).\n\nAssume that you start at some position $(x_0, y_0)$ at second $1$, and can catch fish until (and including) second $l$. From how many points in the lake can you catch fish, if you travel optimally on the lake?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with the integers $r$, $c$, $k$ and $l$ ($1 \\le r, c \\le 100$, $1 \\le k \\le 5$, $1 \\le l \\le 10^5$), the dimensions of the lake, the number of seconds fish stays at a point, and the number of seconds you can catch fish.\n - one line with the integers $x_0$ and $y_0$ ($0 \\le x_0 < r$, $0 \\le y_0 < c$), your original position.\n - $r$ lines, the $x$\u2019th of which contains $c$ integers $t_{x, 0}, \\dots , t_{x, c - 1}$ (each between $1$ and $l$, inclusive), the times at which fish appears on points in the $x$\u2019th row.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum number of points you could catch fish from.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 2 1 10\n0 0\n1 4\n3 2\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3 5 6\n1 1\n1 1 6\n1 2 2\nSample Output 2:\n5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
