You also have a function $f$ that maps every digit from $1$ to $9$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $1$ to $9$.\n\nYou can perform the following operation no more than once: choose a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$, and replace each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$. For example, if $a = 1337$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(7) = 3$, and you choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits, you get $1553$ as the result.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible number you can obtain applying this operation no more than once?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of digits in $a$.\n\nThe second line contains a string of $n$ characters, denoting the number $a$. Each character is a decimal digit from $1$ to $9$.\n\nThe third line contains exactly $9$ integers $f(1)$, $f(2)$, ..., $f(9)$ ($1 \\le f(i) \\le 9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number you can get after applying the operation described in the statement no more than once.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1337\n1 2 5 4 6 6 3 1 9\n\nOutput\n1557\n\nInput\n5\n11111\n9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n99999\n\nInput\n2\n33\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n33\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
