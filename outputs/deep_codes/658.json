No one knows, where and when he met Mishka, but for a long time they are together (excluding her current trip). However, best friends are important too. John is Chris' best friend.\n\nOnce walking with his friend, John gave Chris the following problem:\n\nAt the infinite horizontal road of width w, bounded by lines y = 0 and y = w, there is a bus moving, presented as a convex polygon of n vertices. The bus moves continuously with a constant speed of v in a straight Ox line in direction of decreasing x coordinates, thus in time only x coordinates of its points are changing. Formally, after time t each of x coordinates of its points will be decreased by vt.\n\nThere is a pedestrian in the point (0, 0), who can move only by a vertical pedestrian crossing, presented as a segment connecting points (0, 0) and (0, w) with any speed not exceeding u. Thus the pedestrian can move only in a straight line Oy in any direction with any speed not exceeding u and not leaving the road borders. The pedestrian can instantly change his speed, thus, for example, he can stop instantly.\n\nPlease look at the sample note picture for better understanding.\n\nWe consider the pedestrian is hit by the bus, if at any moment the point he is located in lies strictly inside the bus polygon (this means that if the point lies on the polygon vertex or on its edge, the pedestrian is not hit by the bus).\n\nYou are given the bus position at the moment 0.
