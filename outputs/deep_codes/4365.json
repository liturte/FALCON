The \"//\" operator is used for integer division, which discards the fractional part.\n\nFor example, if K=3, there are 2 even numbers (2 and 4) and 1 odd number (3), so the number of ways to choose a pair is 2*1=2.\n\nIf K=4, there are 2 even numbers (2 and 4) and 2 odd numbers (1 and 3), so the number of ways to choose a pair is 2*2=4.\n\nThis code assumes that K is even, as the problem statement states that the order does not matter. If K is odd, the code will still work correctly, but it will not count the pair (K,1) because 1 is odd and K is even.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle the case where K is less than 2 or greater than 100 as per the problem statement.

It then creates two lists: `even` and `odd`. The `even` list contains all the even numbers from 2 to K, and the `odd` list contains all the odd numbers from 1 to K. The number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number from these lists is the product of their lengths.\n\nThis solution assumes that the order of the numbers in the pair does not matter.
