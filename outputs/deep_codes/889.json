Some of the square's cells are painted black and others are painted white. Your task is to repaint at most one cell the other color so that the picture has a 2 \u00d7 2 square, completely consisting of cells of the same color. If the initial picture already has such a square, the person should just say so and the test will be completed. \n\nYour task is to write a program that determines whether it is possible to pass the test. You cannot pass the test if either repainting any cell or no action doesn't result in a 2 \u00d7 2 square, consisting of cells of the same color.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFour lines contain four characters each: the j-th character of the i-th line equals \".\" if the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column of the square is painted white, and \"#\", if the cell is black.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the test can be passed and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n####\n.#..\n####\n....\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n####\n....\n####\n....\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test sample it is enough to repaint the first cell in the second row. After such repainting the required 2 \u00d7 2 square is on the intersection of the 1-st and 2-nd row with the 1-st and 2-nd column.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
