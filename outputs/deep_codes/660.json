The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.\n\nThe tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):  let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k \u2264 m,  k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly,  when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. \n\nEach match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.\n\nFind the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.\n\nNote that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 \u2264 n, b, p \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers x and y \u2014 the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 3\n\nOutput\n20 15\n\nInput\n8 2 4\n\nOutput\n35 32\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example will be three rounds:  in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge),  in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water,  in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. \n\nSo in total we need 20 bottles of water.\n\nIn the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
