It then iterates over all possible positions AtCoDeer could start his travel from (the minimum and maximum coordinates of the houses). For each position, it calculates the total travel distance to all houses (by summing the absolute differences between the house's coordinate and the current position). If this distance is less than the current minimum distance, it updates the minimum distance. Finally, it prints the minimum distance.\n\nThis", "import sys\n\ndef min_distance():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    houses = sorted(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n    return min(max(houses) - min(houses), sum(houses) - max(houses))\n\nprint(min_distance())\n\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the houses' coordinates. Then it calculates the minimum distance by finding the difference between the minimum and maximum coordinates. It also calculates the total distance of all houses and subtracts the maximum coordinate from this to get a possible minimum distance. The smaller of these two distances is the minimum distance to be traveled.\n\nThis solution assumes that the travel distance is measured in the same units as the coordinates, and that the coordinates are non-negative.\n\nPlease note that this solution requires the Python 3 standard library, and it should be run with Python 3.\n\nThe input is read from", "def min_distance():\n    N = int(input())\n    coordinates = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    coordinates.sort()\n    median = coordinates[N//2]\n    return sum(abs(x-median) for x in coordinates)\n\nprint(min_distance())\n\nThis code works by first sorting the list of coordinates. Since the reindeer can start and end his travel at any position, the median of the list of coordinates is the optimal starting point. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences to all other points in the list. The code then calculates and returns the sum of these absolute differences.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be valid according to the problem constraints. If the input could be invalid, the code should be modified to handle these cases appropriately.\n\nAlso, please note that this code only works for even N. If N is odd, the code will not return the correct result. This is because", "n = int(input())\na = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(a[-1] - a[0])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the fact that the minimum distance to be traveled is the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates.\n\nSo, we first read the number of houses `n` and their coordinates `a`. We then sort the list of coordinates. The minimum distance is then `a[-1] - a[0]`, where `a[-1]` is the last element of the list (the furthest right house) and `a[0]` is the first element of the list (the furthest left house).\n\nThis solution works because the reindeer can start and end his travel at any position, so he could start at the furthest left house and end at the furthest right house, regardless of the positions of the other houses. This would be the shortest", "import sys\n\ndef min_distance():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    coordinates = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))\n    coordinates.sort()\n    median = coordinates[N//2]\n    return sum(abs(coord - median) for coord in coordinates)\n\nprint(min_distance())\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe minimum distance to be traveled is achieved by starting and ending at the median of the houses' coordinates. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences from the actual values to the expected value, which is the middle value in the sorted list of coordinates. By calculating the sum of absolute differences from each coordinate to the median, we get the minimum total travel distance.\n\nIn the sample input, the median is 7, and the minimum total travel distance is 7 (from 2 to 7 and from 7 to 9)."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIt is only six months until Christmas, and AtCoDeer the reindeer is now planning his travel to deliver gifts.\n\nThere are N houses along TopCoDeer street.
