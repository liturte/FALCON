To order the stars it is necessary to estimate order cost that depends on the area of gold-plating. Write a program that can calculate the area of a star.\n\nA \"star\" figure having n \u2265 5 corners where n is a prime number is constructed the following way. On the circle of radius r n points are selected so that the distances between the adjacent ones are equal. Then every point is connected by a segment with two maximally distant points. All areas bounded by the segments parts are the figure parts.
