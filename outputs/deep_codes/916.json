In this case, both leaves will have 2 apples. If Soliman makes a move in a leaf node, Sagheer can make the same move in the other leaf. If Soliman moved some apples from a root to a leaf, Sagheer will eat those moved apples. Eventually, Soliman will not find a move.\n\nIn the second sample, There is no swap that will make Sagheer win the game.\n\nNote that Sagheer must make the swap even if he can win with the initial tree.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
