It then uses a generator expression to sum up all the negative numbers (expenses) in k.

To sell the software, he arranges meetings all over the country. Of course, he always needs to travel there, and sometimes even stay the night. Other times, he decides that a hot dog on the way to a meeting counts as accommodation.\n\nBecause Robin is very busy, he hasn\u2019t been able to file his job expenses this month. Eret, the accountant, told him that he could fix it for him, as long as he got the price of all the expenses along with the receipts. Robin did this but misheard him: He has provided a list of all expenses and incomes he has brought in last month, with incomes as positive integers and expenses as negative integers.\n\nCan you help Eret find out how much expenses Robin has paid for the last month?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consist of two lines: One line with the integer $N$, and one line with $N$ integers $k_ i$, representing the numbers Robin has written down.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the sum of all the expenses Robin has paid for the last month.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $0 \\leq N \\leq 20000$\n - $-50000 \\leq k_ i\\leq 500000$ and $k_ i \\neq 0$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 -2 3\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n129 44 394 253 147\nSample Output 2:\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
