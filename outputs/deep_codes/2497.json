Now, each point starts moving at a speed of 1 per second, in a direction parallel to the x- or y- axis. You are given a character d_i that represents the specific direction in which the i-th point moves, as follows:\n - If d_i = R, the i-th point moves in the positive x direction;\n - If d_i = L, the i-th point moves in the negative x direction;\n - If d_i = U, the i-th point moves in the positive y direction;\n - If d_i = D, the i-th point moves in the negative y direction.\nYou can stop all the points at some moment of your choice after they start moving (including the moment they start moving).\nThen, let x_{max} and x_{min} be the maximum and minimum among the x-coordinates of the N points, respectively. Similarly, let y_{max} and y_{min} be the maximum and minimum among the y-coordinates of the N points, respectively.\nFind the minimum possible value of (x_{max} - x_{min}) \\times (y_{max} - y_{min}) and print it.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - -10^8 \\leq x_i,\\ y_i \\leq 10^8\n - x_i and y_i are integers.\n - d_i is R, L, U, or D.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nx_1 y_1 d_1\nx_2 y_2 d_2\n.\n.\n.\nx_N y_N d_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum possible value of (x_{max} - x_{min}) \\times (y_{max} - y_{min}).\nThe output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-9}.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n0 3 D\n3 0 L\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n0\n\nAfter three seconds, the two points will meet at the origin. The value in question will be 0 at that moment.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
