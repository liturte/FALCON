{"4588": {"code": ["x, y = input().split()\n\nif x < y:\n    print('<')\nelif x > y:\n    print('>')\nelse:\n    print('=')\n\n\nThis Python solution takes in two hexadecimal characters as input, and then compares them using the standard comparison operators. It prints '<' if the first character is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal.\n\nThe comparison is done using ASCII values, where A-F correspond to decimal values 10-15. Python's string comparison uses these values for comparison, which is why this solution works.\n\nThe input() function reads a line from standard input, and the split() function splits that line into words. The variables x and y are then set to the first and second words.\n\nThe if-elif-else statement is a control flow construct that executes one of its branches based on the value of its condition. In this case, the condition is a comparison between x and y.\n\nThe print function outputs its argument(s) to standard output. In this case", "X, Y = input().split()\nprint('<' if int(X, 16) < int(Y, 16) else '>' if int(X, 16) > int(Y, 16) else '=')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe input is read in the form of two hexadecimal numbers X and Y. \nThe `int(X, 16)` and `int(Y, 16)` are used to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal.\nThen, the comparison is made to determine which one is larger or if they are equal. \nThe result is then printed as per the problem statement.\n\nThis code works because Python's built-in `int` function can take a second argument to specify the base of the number (in this case, 16 for hexadecimal).\n\nFor example, `int('A', 16)` would return `10`, `int('B', 16)` would return `11`, and so on.\n\nThe comparison operators `<`, `>`,", "X, Y = input().split()\n\nhex_values = {'A': 10, 'B': 11, 'C': 12, 'D': 13, 'E': 14, 'F': 15}\n\nif hex_values[X] < hex_values[Y]:\n    print('<')\nelif hex_values[X] > hex_values[Y]:\n    print('>')\nelse:\n    print('=')\n\n\nThis code first reads the two hexadecimal digits X and Y from the input. It then compares their numerical values (which are stored in the dictionary `hex_values`) and prints the appropriate comparison symbol.\n\nNote: This assumes that the input will always be valid, as it does not include error checking for invalid inputs.\n\n\nX, Y = input().split()\nhex_values = {'A': 10, 'B': 11, 'C': 12, 'D': 13, 'E': 14, 'F': 15}\nif hex_values[", "X, Y = input().split()\nprint('<' if int(X, 16) < int(Y, 16) else '>' if int(X, 16) > int(Y, 16) else '=')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a Python program that reads two hexadecimal digits X and Y from the input, converts them to integers using base 16, and then compares them. It outputs '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X and Y are equal.\nThe `int(X, 16)` part is used to convert the hexadecimal digit X to a decimal integer. The second argument to the int function (16) specifies the base of the number in the string.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., two uppercase letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\nNote: The hexadecimal system is base 16, which means it uses 16 different symbols (0", "x, y = input().split()\nprint('<' if int(x, 16) < int(y, 16) else '>' if int(x, 16) > int(y, 16) else '=')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe input is read from the user and split into two variables `x` and `y`. The `int` function is used to convert these variables from hexadecimal to decimal. The comparison operator is used to compare the decimal values of `x` and `y`. The result is printed based on the comparison.\n\nThe `int` function converts a number or string `x` to an integer, or returns 0 if no arguments are given. If `x` is a string, then it should contain a number in base `base`.\n\nIn this case, `base` is 16, so the string `x` is interpreted as a hexadecimal number.\n\nThe comparison operator `<`, `>` and `==` are used to compare `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than `y`"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn programming, hexadecimal notation is often used.\nIn hexadecimal notation, besides the ten digits 0, 1, ..., 9, the six letters A, B, C, D, E and F are used to represent the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively.\nIn this problem, you are given two letters X and Y.
