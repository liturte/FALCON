However, since the problem statement specifies that the performance should be an integer, we need to use integer division (//).\nAlso, since we are dealing with averages, we need to multiply R by 2 before dividing by 2. This is because in the", "R = int(input())\nG = int(input())\nprint((G*2-R))\n\n\nThis Python program reads the current rating `R` and the desired rating `G` from the standard input, calculates the required performance `P` as `2*G - R`, and prints it to the standard output.", "R = int(input())\nG = int(input())\nprint((2*G - R) / 2)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe formula to calculate the new rating is the average of the current rating and the performance.

The average of R and G is G, so the performance needed is (G * 2 - R) * 2.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input, and the result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThe input and output values are integers in the range 0 to 4500.

This is a simple arithmetic operation, so the solution is a single line of code that does that calculation.\n\nIn Python, the `map()` function is used to apply a function to all items in an input list. In this case, it is used to convert the inputs from strings to integers.
