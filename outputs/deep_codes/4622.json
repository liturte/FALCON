{"4622": {"code": ["N = int(input())\nnums = set(map(int, input().split()))\nprint('YES' if len(nums) == N else 'NO')\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer N and N integers from the standard input. It creates a set from the input integers, and if the length of the set is equal to N, it prints \"YES\", otherwise it prints \"NO\". The set automatically removes duplicate elements, so if the length of the set is equal to N, all elements in the input are pairwise distinct.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N) because it reads N integers and adds them to a set. The space complexity is also O(N) because in the worst case, all N integers could be distinct and stored in a set.\n\nThe program assumes that the input is always valid according to the constraints.

It uses the set data structure in Python to check if the elements of the sequence are pairwise distinct. If all elements are distinct, the size of the set will be equal to the number of elements in the sequence. Otherwise, the size of the set will be less than the number of elements in the sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nThe code provided above is a Python solution for the problem.
