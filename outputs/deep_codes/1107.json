Berland students are so tough that all they drink is orange juice!\n\nYesterday one student, Vasya and his mates made some barbecue and they drank this healthy drink only. After they ran out of the first barrel of juice, they decided to play a simple game. All n people who came to the barbecue sat in a circle (thus each person received a unique index b_{i} from 0 to n - 1). The person number 0 started the game (this time it was Vasya). All turns in the game were numbered by integers starting from 1. If the j-th turn was made by the person with index b_{i}, then this person acted like that:  he pointed at the person with index (b_{i} + 1)\u00a0mod\u00a0n either with an elbow or with a nod (x\u00a0mod\u00a0y is the remainder after dividing x by y);  if j \u2265 4 and the players who had turns number j - 1, j - 2, j - 3, made during their turns the same moves as player b_{i} on the current turn, then he had drunk a glass of juice;  the turn went to person number (b_{i} + 1)\u00a0mod\u00a0n. \n\nThe person who was pointed on the last turn did not make any actions.\n\nThe problem was, Vasya's drunk too much juice and can't remember the goal of the game. However, Vasya's got the recorded sequence of all the participants' actions (including himself). Now Vasya wants to find out the maximum amount of juice he could drink if he played optimally well (the other players' actions do not change).

In the second sample Vasya wouldn't drink a single glass of juice as the moves performed during turns 3 and 4 are different.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
