Here is the process he could have followed.  $1$-st step. The initial array is empty. He can choose an empty subset and obtain $0$, because the mex of an empty set is $0$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0]$.  $2$-nd step. The current array is $[0]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1]$.  $3$-rd step. The current array is $[0,1]$. He can choose a subset $[0,1]$ and obtain an integer $2$, because $mex(0,1) = 2$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2]$.  $4$-th step. The current array is $[0,1,2]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2,1]$. \n\nThus, he can get the array without mistakes, so the answer is $-1$.\n\nIn the second example he has definitely made a mistake on the very first step, because he could not have obtained anything different from $0$.\n\nIn the third example he could have obtained $[0, 1, 2]$ without mistakes, but $239$ is definitely wrong.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
