A Roman mile was the distance a soldier would walk in $1000$ paces (a pace being two steps, one with each foot). \n\nOver time, the actual distance referred to as a \u201cmile\u201d has changed. The modern English mile is $5280$ (modern) feet. The Roman mile is believed to have been about $4854$ (modern) feet. Therefore a distance of $x$ English miles would correspond to $1000 \\cdot \\frac{5280}{4854}$ Roman paces.\n\nWrite a program to convert distances in English miles into Roman paces.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput will consist of a single line containing a single real number $0 \\le X \\le 1000$ denoting a distance in English miles. The number $X$ has at most $3$ digits of precision after the decimal point.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint an integer denoting the closest number of Roman paces equivalent to X. Your answer should be rounded to the closest integer (with an exact $.5$ decimal part rounded up).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1.0\nSample Output:\n1088\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
