The constraints state that N will always be greater than or equal to 1, so this assumption is made.\n\nAlso, this solution does not handle the case where A or B are greater than the maximum allowed values (100 and 2000 respectively). The constraints state that these values will always be within the allowed range, so this assumption is made.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A*N < B:\n    print(A*N)\nelse:\n    print(B)\n\n\nThis Python program reads the input values N, A, and B, calculates the fee for Plan 1 and Plan 2, and prints the minimum fee.\n\nIt uses the `map` function to read the input as integers, and the `split` function to separate the input values. The `if` statement compares the fees for Plan 1 and Plan 2, and prints the smaller one.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the input is always valid, as the problem statement does not specify any error handling.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nmin_fee = B\nfor t in range(N+1):\n    fee = A*t if A*t<B else B\n    if fee < min_fee:\n        min_fee = fee\nprint(min_fee)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program reads the input values N, A, and B. It then calculates the fee for each possible duration (t) from 0 to N hours, and chooses the minimum fee. If the fee for Plan 1 is less than the fee for Plan 2, the fee for Plan 1 is used; otherwise, the fee for Plan 2 is used. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it loops over N possible durations. It also has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input values and the minimum fee.", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef calc_fee(N, A, B):\n    if N*A > B:\n        return B\n    else:\n        return N*A\n\nprint(calc_fee(N, A, B))\n\nThis code reads the input, calculates the fee for each plan, and then returns the minimum fee.\nIt uses a function `calc_fee` that calculates the fee for a given plan.\nIf the fee for plan 1 is less than the fee for plan 2, it returns the fee for plan 1.

Then it calculates the fee for Plan 1 and Plan 2, and returns the minimum of these two values.\n\nIt uses the `min` function to find the minimum of the two values. If the fee for Plan 1 is less than the fee for Plan 2, it returns the fee for Plan 1. Otherwise, it returns the fee for Plan 2.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input values are always valid according to the constraints.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), because it always executes the same number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input values and the output value.\n\nThis solution works by trying both plans and choosing the one that gives the smallest fee."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are parking at a parking lot.
