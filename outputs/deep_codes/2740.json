She clips it into pieces of various integral lengths, then aligns them with the bottom of a frame, rising vertically in columns, to form a mountain scene. A mountain scene must be uneven; if all columns are the same height, it\u2019s a plain scene, not a mountain scene! It is possible that she may not use all of the ribbon.\n\nIf our artist has $4$ inches of ribbon and a $2 \\times 2$ inch frame, she could form these scenes:\n\nShe would not form these scenes, because they\u2019re plains, not mountains!\n\nGiven the length of the ribbon and the width and height of the frame, all in inches, how many different mountain scenes can she create? Two scenes are different if the regions covered by ribbon are different. There\u2019s no point in putting more than one piece of ribbon in any column.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input will consist of a single line with three space-separated integers $n$, $w$ and $h$, where $n$ ($0 \\le n \\le 10000$) is the length of the ribbon in inches, $w$ ($1 \\le w \\le 100$) is the width and $h$ ($1 \\le h \\le 100$) is the height of the frame, both in inches.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, indicating the total number of mountain scenes our artist could possibly make, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n25 5 5\nSample Output 1:\n7770\n\nSample Input 2:\n15 5 5\nSample Output 2:\n6050\n\nSample Input 3:\n10 10 1\nSample Output 3:\n1022\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
