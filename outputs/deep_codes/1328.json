For each kind of chemical, there is exactly one package of that chemical in stock.\n\nThe package of chemical i contains a_i grams of the substance A and b_i grams of the substance B, and is sold for c_i yen (the currency of Japan).\n\nDolphin will purchase some of these packages. For some reason, he must use all contents of the purchased packages to generate the substance C.\n\nFind the minimum amount of money required to generate the substance C.\n\nIf it is not possible to generate the substance C by purchasing any combination of packages at the pharmacy, report that fact.  \n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266N\u226640 \n - 1\u2266a_i,b_i\u226610 \n - 1\u2266c_i\u2266100 \n - 1\u2266M_a,M_b\u226610 \n - gcd(M_a,M_b)=1\n - a_i, b_i, c_i, M_a and M_b are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M_a M_b  \na_1 b_1 c_1  \na_2 b_2 c_2\n:  \na_N b_N c_N  \n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum amount of money required to generate the substance C. If it is not possible to generate the substance C, print -1 instead.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 1 2\n3 3 10\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThe amount of money spent will be minimized by purchasing the packages of chemicals 1 and 2.\n\nIn this case, the mixture of the purchased chemicals will contain 3 grams of the substance A and 3 grams of the substance B, which are in the desired ratio: 3:3=1:1.\n\nThe total price of these packages is 3 yen.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
