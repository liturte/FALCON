The second option is cheaper, thus the answer is $1$.\n\nThe third testcase shows that you can't rotate $1 \\times 2$ tiles. You still have to use two $1 \\times 1$ tiles for the total price of $20$.\n\nIn the fourth testcase the cheapest way is to use $1 \\times 1$ tiles everywhere. The total cost is $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
