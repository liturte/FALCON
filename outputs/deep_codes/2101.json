The best area of them is $4 \\times 5 = 20$.\n\nIn the second example the best rectangles are: red/blue $9 \\times 8$, red/blue $5 \\times 5$, green/blue $2 \\times 1$. So the total area is $72 + 25 + 2 = 99$.\n\nIn the third example the best rectangles are: red/green $19 \\times 8$ and red/blue $20 \\times 11$. The total area is $152 + 220 = 372$. Note that you can't construct more rectangles because you are not allowed to have both pairs taken to be the same color.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
