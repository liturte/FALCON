The height of the pyramid is determined by the number of layers it has. The number of cubes needed for each layer is the sum of the numbers from 1 to that layer. This can be represented as n*(n+1)/2.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to find the maximum value of 'n' that satisfies the equation n*(n+1)/2 <= given_number_of_cubes. This can be solved by using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The solutions to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).

The maximum height of the pyramid is determined by the number of cubes available, which is given as input. The maximum height is calculated by solving the equation 1 + 2 + ... + x + (x+1) = n for x. This is done using the math library's sqrt function to calculate the square root, and the result is converted to an integer for output.\n\nThis solution is efficient and will run in O(1) time, since it does not depend on the input size.", "import math\n\ndef max_pyramid_height(n):\n    return math.floor((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8*n)) / 2)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(max_pyramid_height(n))\n\n\nThis solution works by using a mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is `(n*(n+1))/2`, and it's used to calculate the total number of cubes needed for each level of the pyramid. By rearranging the formula to solve for `n`, we get `n = (sqrt(1 + 8*total_cubes) - 1) / 2`. The maximum possible height of the pyramid is the largest integer less than or equal to this value. The `math.floor()` function is used to round down to the nearest integer.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input and passed to the `max_pyramid_height()` function. The result is", "import math\n\nn = int(input().strip())\n\nmax_height = int((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8*n)) / 2)\n\nprint(max_height)\n\n\nThis program works by solving the equation 1 + 2 + ... + (i - 1) + i = n for i, which is the number of cubes used for the i-th level of the pyramid. The solution to this equation is (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8n)) / 2. The maximum height of the pyramid is the largest integer less than or equal to this solution.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that n is a positive integer and that the number of cubes given to Vanya is sufficient to build a pyramid.\n\nThis solution is based on the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is used to calculate the number of cubes used for each level of the pyramid.\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSW", "import math\n\ndef max_pyramid_height(n):\n    return int((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8*n)) / 2)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(max_pyramid_height(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe height of the pyramid is determined by the number of cubes used.

He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist of 1 + 2 = 3 cubes, the third level must have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cubes, and so on.
