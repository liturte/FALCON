The cube root of X gives the largest integer b such that b^3 <= X. Since b^3 = b*b*b, we can say that b^3 = b^(3/3), which simplifies to b^(1/3). Therefore, we use `math.pow` with argument 1/3 to find the cube root of X. The `int` function is used to convert the result to an integer, as the `math.pow` function returns a float.\n\nThe program will print the largest perfect power that is at most X.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that X is at least 1. If X can be 0, you should add a check for that case at the start of the program.\n\nAlso, this program works for perfect powers of the form b^p, where p is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If you want to include perfect powers of the form b^p where p is an integer less than 2 (i.e., b^p where p is a fraction), you should adjust the program accordingly.\n\nNote: This program uses the `math.pow` function which is a", "import math\n\nX = int(input())\n\nmax_p = 2\nwhile max_p <= X:\n    max_p *= 2\n\nprint(int(math.pow(2, max_p - 1) - 1))\n\n\nThis Python program reads an integer X from standard input, then computes the largest perfect power that is at most X. It does this by first determining the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to X, and then computing 2^(max_p - 1) - 1, which is the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to 2^max_p - 1.\n\nThe `math.pow` function is used to compute the power of 2, and the result is cast to an integer with `int` before printing.\n\nThis program assumes that X is greater than or equal to 1, as specified in the problem constraints.\n\nThis program works by repeatedly doubling the power until it exceeds X, then it prints the largest perfect power that is less than or equal to X. The largest perfect power is computed as 2^(max_p - 1) - 1.\n\"\"\"\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nint main() {\n    int X;\n    std::cin >> X;\n\n    int max", "import math\n\nX = int(input())\nmax_power = 0\nfor b in range(2, int(math.log2(X))+1):\n    p = int(math.log(X, b))\n    max_power = max(max_power, b**p)\nprint(max_power)\n\n\nThis solution uses a simple brute-force approach. It iterates over all possible bases (b) from 2 to the base-2 logarithm of X (inclusive). For each base, it computes the power (p) that would yield the largest perfect power that is at most X. The largest perfect power is then updated if the current perfect power (b^p) is larger than the current maximum. The result is then printed out.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(log(X)^2), which is feasible for the given constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef largest_perfect_power(X: int) -> int:\n    max_power = 0\n    for b in range(2, int(X**0.5)+1):\n        p = int(math.log(X, b))\n        max_power = max(max_power, b**p)\n    return max_power\n\n\nThis solution is more efficient than the previous one because it reduces the number of iterations", "import math\n\nX = int(input())\n\n# Start from the largest perfect power and check if it is at most X\np = 2\nwhile 1 < p <= X:\n    b = 1\n    while b < X:\n        power = b ** p\n        if power > X:\n            break\n        elif power == X:\n            print(X)\n            exit(0)\n        b += 1\n    p += 1\n\n# If no perfect power is found, print the largest perfect power less than X\nprint((b - 1) ** p)\n\n\nThis code starts from the largest perfect power and checks if it is at most X. If it is, it prints the perfect power and exits. If it isn't, it continues with the next largest perfect power.

For each number b, we calculate p such that b^p is at most X. If b^p is larger than 1 and less than or equal to X, and it is larger than the largest_perfect_power we have seen so far, we update largest_perfect_power. Finally, we print the largest_perfect_power.\n\nThis solution works by brute-forcing all possible bases b and exponents p, and checking whether b^p is a perfect power of X. The time complexity of this solution is O(X log X), which is feasible for X up to 1000.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is a positive integer.
