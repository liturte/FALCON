Recall that the permutation is the array of length $n$ which contains each integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.\n\nFor all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$ the following properties hold: $s[p_i] \\le s[p_{i + 1}]$ and $s[q_i] \\le s[q_{i + 1}]$. It means that if you will write down all characters of $s$ in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.\n\nYour task is to restore any such string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of at least $k$ distinct lowercase Latin letters which suits the given permutations.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 26$) \u2014 the length of the string and the number of distinct characters required.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$) \u2014 the permutation $p$.\n\nThe third line of the input contains $n$ integers $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$ ($1 \\le q_i \\le n$, all $q_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$) \u2014 the permutation $q$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to find the suitable string, print \"NO\" on the first line.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" on the first line and string $s$ on the second line. It should consist of $n$ lowercase Latin letters, contain at least $k$ distinct characters and suit the given permutations.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput\nYES\nabb\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
