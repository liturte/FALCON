{"2842": {"code": ["QUESTION:\nBattleship is a game played by two players. Each player has their own grid, which is hidden from their opponent. Each player secretly places some ships on their grid. Each ship covers a horizontal or vertical straight line of one or more contiguous squares. Ships cannot overlap. All ships are considered distinct, even if they have the same size. The orientation of each ship is not important to the game, only the squares they occupy.\n\nAfter placing their ships, the players then take turns taking shots at their opponent\u2019s ships by calling out a coordinate of their opponent\u2019s grid. The opponent must honestly say whether the shot was a hit or a miss. When all of a ship\u2019s squares are hit, that ship sinks (\u201cYou sunk my battleship!!\u201d).
