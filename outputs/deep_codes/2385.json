The i-th edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and b_i.\nFor each k=1, ..., N, solve the problem below:\n - Consider writing a number on each vertex in the tree in the following manner:\n - First, write 1 on Vertex k.\n - Then, for each of the numbers 2, ..., N in this order, write the number on the vertex chosen as follows:\n - Choose a vertex that still does not have a number written on it and is adjacent to a vertex with a number already written on it. If there are multiple such vertices, choose one of them at random.\n - Find the number of ways in which we can write the numbers on the vertices, modulo (10^9+7).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq a_i,b_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is a tree.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\na_1 b_1\n:\na_{N-1} b_{N-1}\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each k=1, 2, ..., N in this order, print a line containing the answer to the problem.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n1\n1\n\nThe graph in this input is as follows:\n\nFor k=1, there are two ways in which we can write the numbers on the vertices, as follows:\n - Writing 1, 2, 3 on Vertex 1, 2, 3, respectively\n - Writing 1, 3, 2 on Vertex 1, 2, 3, respectively\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
