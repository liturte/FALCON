The desert can be represented as a n \u00d7 n square matrix, where each cell is a zone of the desert. The cell (i, j) represents the cell at row i and column j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n). Iahub can go from one cell (i, j) only down or right, that is to cells (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1). \n\nAlso, there are m cells that are occupied by volcanoes, which Iahub cannot enter. \n\nIahub is initially at cell (1, 1) and he needs to travel to cell (n, n). Knowing that Iahub needs 1 second to travel from one cell to another, find the minimum time in which he can arrive in cell (n, n).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers, x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n), representing the coordinates of the volcanoes.\n\nConsider matrix rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and matrix columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. There is no volcano in cell (1, 1). No two volcanoes occupy the same location. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer, the minimum time in which Iahub can arrive at cell (n, n). If no solution exists (there is no path to the final cell), print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n7 8\n1 6\n2 6\n3 5\n3 6\n4 3\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first sample. A possible road is: (1, 1)  \u2192  (1, 2)  \u2192  (2, 2)  \u2192  (2, 3)  \u2192  (3, 3)  \u2192  (3, 4)  \u2192  (4, 4).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
