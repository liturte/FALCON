Then each of them will see five grannies when they come out. Therefore, Maria and five other grannies will be in the yard.\n\nIn the second test case in the example, no one can be in the yard, so Maria will remain there alone.\n\nThe third test case in the example is described in the details above.\n\nIn the fourth test case in the example, on the first step Maria can call grannies with numbers $1$, $2$ and $3$. If on the second step Maria calls $4$ or $5$ (one of them), then when a granny appears in the yard, she will see only four grannies (but it is forbidden). It means that Maria can't call the $4$-th granny or the $5$-th granny separately (one of them). If she calls both: $4$ and $5$, then when they appear, they will see $4+1=5$ grannies. Despite the fact that it is enough for the $4$-th granny, the $5$-th granny is not satisfied. So, Maria cannot call both the $4$-th granny and the $5$-th granny at the same time. That is, Maria and three grannies from the first step will be in the yard in total.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
