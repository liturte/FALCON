You can perform two types of operations:   Pay $a$ dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by $1$. For example, if $x = 0$ and $y = 7$ there are four possible outcomes after this operation:   $x = 0$, $y = 6$;  $x = 0$, $y = 8$;  $x = -1$, $y = 7$;  $x = 1$, $y = 7$. \n\n  Pay $b$ dollars and increase or decrease both integers by $1$. For example, if $x = 0$ and $y = 7$ there are two possible outcomes after this operation:   $x = -1$, $y = 6$;  $x = 1$, $y = 8$.  \n\nYour goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. $x = y = 0$. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from $x=1$, $y=0$ to $x=y=0$.\n\nCalculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n1 3\n391 555\n0 0\n9 4\n\nOutput\n1337\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: first, second, first. This way you spend $391 + 555 + 391 = 1337$ dollars.\n\nIn the second test case both integers are equal to zero initially, so you dont' have to spend money.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
