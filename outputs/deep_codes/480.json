Thus, he has to pass 2 meters and it takes 8 seconds in total, because he passes 1 meter per 4 seconds. \n\nIn the second example Igor can, for example, go towards the point x_2 and get to the point 1 in 6 seconds (because he has to pass 3 meters, but he passes 1 meters per 2 seconds). At that moment the tram will be at the point 1, so Igor can enter the tram and pass 1 meter in 1 second. Thus, Igor will reach the point x_2 in 7 seconds in total.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
