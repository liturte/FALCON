Your task is to find the number of distinct decompositions of number m into the product of n ordered positive integers.\n\nDecomposition into n products, given in the input, must also be considered in the answer. As the answer can be very large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500). The second line contains space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single number k \u2014 the number of distinct decompositions of number m into n ordered multipliers modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n15\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n2\n5 7\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, the get a decomposition of number 2, you need any one number out of three to equal 2, and the rest to equal 1.\n\nIn the third sample, the possible ways of decomposing into ordered multipliers are [7,5], [5,7], [1,35], [35,1].\n\nA decomposition of positive integer m into n ordered multipliers is a cortege of positive integers b = {b_1, b_2, ... b_{n}} such that $m = \\prod_{i = 1}^{n} b_{i}$. Two decompositions b and c are considered different, if there exists index i such that b_{i} \u2260 c_{i}.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
