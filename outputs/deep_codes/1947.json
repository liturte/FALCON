Maybe the cause of it is the excess of vitamins, or maybe it is some black magic...\n\nTo prevent this, Alice decided to go to the hairdresser. She wants for her hair length to be at most $l$ centimeters after haircut, where $l$ is her favorite number. Suppose, that the Alice's head is a straight line on which $n$ hairlines grow. Let's number them from $1$ to $n$. With one swing of the scissors the hairdresser can shorten all hairlines on any segment to the length $l$, given that all hairlines on that segment had length strictly greater than $l$. The hairdresser wants to complete his job as fast as possible, so he will make the least possible number of swings of scissors, since each swing of scissors takes one second.\n\nAlice hasn't decided yet when she would go to the hairdresser, so she asked you to calculate how much time the haircut would take depending on the time she would go to the hairdresser.

Then Alice's second hairline grows, the lengths of hairlines are now equal to $1, 5, 3, 4$  Now haircut takes two seonds: two swings are required: for the $4$-th hairline and for the $2$-nd.  Then Alice's first hairline grows, the lengths of hairlines are now equal to $4, 5, 3, 4$  The haircut still takes two seconds: with one swing hairdresser can cut $4$-th hairline and with one more swing cut the segment from $1$-st to $2$-nd hairline.  Then Alice's third hairline grows, the lengths of hairlines are now equal to $4, 5, 4, 4$  Now haircut takes only one second: with one swing it is possible to cut the segment from $1$-st hairline to the $4$-th.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
