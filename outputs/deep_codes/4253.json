The result is then printed out.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is an integer between 1 and 100, as specified in the problem constraints. If the input is not within this range, the program may not behave as expected.\n\nThe area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle can be calculated using the formula 3 * r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. This formula is derived from the area of a circle (\u03c0 * r^2) and the area of a regular dodecagon (12 * s^2, where s is the side length of the dodecagon). By dividing the area of the circle by the number of sides in a regular dodecagon, we can find the side length of the dodecagon, and then use the formula for the area of a regular dodecagon to find the area of the inscribed dodecagon.\n\nPlease note that this solution is based on the assumption that the input is an integer between 1 and 100. If the input is not within this range, the program may not behave as expected.\n\nFor example, if r = 4, the program will print 48, which is the area of a regular", "import math\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0", "r = int(input())\narea = 3 * r**2\nprint(area)\n\n\nThis Python code takes an integer input for the radius r, calculates the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle with radius r using the formula 3a^2, and then prints the result.\n\nPlease note that the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle is always a square of the radius.
