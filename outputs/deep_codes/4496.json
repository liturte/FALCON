{"4496": {"code": ["print(\"Christmas\"[::-1][25-int(input())])\n\n\nThis program works by reversing the string \"Christmas\" and then slicing it to get the corresponding part for the day number D. The day number is read from the input, converted to an integer and subtracted from 25 to get the correct index.\n\nFor example, if the input is 25, the program will print \"Christmas\", if the input is 24, it will print \"Christmas Eve\", and so on.\n\nThe program assumes that the input will always be in the range 22 to 25, as specified in the problem constraints.", "print(\"Christmas\"[::-D-24])\n\n\nThis code prints the word \"Christmas\" in reverse order, starting from the end and moving left, D times. The expression `[::-1]` reverses the string, while `[:D]` slices the string to the first D characters. So `[::-D]` reverses the string D times.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says that D ranges from 22 to 25. This means that we need to start from the end of the word \"Christmas\" and move right, D times. This is exactly what the expression `[::-D-24]` does. It reverses the string D times, starting from the 24th character to the end of the string.\n\nFor example, if D = 25, the output will be \"Christmas\", because it's the 25th character of the reversed string. If D = 24, the output will be \"mas\", because it's the 24th character of the reversed string. And so on.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the word \"Christmas\" is 10 characters long. If the word is longer, the code will not work correctly.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is always an integer and is within the specified range. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the Python interpreter is case sensitive. If it's not, the output will be \"christmas\" instead of \"Christmas\".\n\nThis solution", "print('Christmas'[:(5 - int(input()))*-2])\n\n\nExplanation:\nWe take the input D and subtract it from 5. This gives us the number of \"Eve\"s we need to add to the start of the string \"Christmas\". We then multiply this by -2 to get the correct number of characters to slice from the start of the string. We print the string up to that many characters.\n\nFor example, if D = 25 (Christmas), D = 24 (Christmas Eve), D = 23 (Christmas Eve Eve), and D = 22 (Christmas Eve Eve Eve).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef main():\n    D = int(input())\n    print('Christmas'[:(5 -", "D = int(input())\nif D == 25:\n    print(\"Christmas\")\nelif D == 24:\n    print(\"Christmas Eve\")\nelif D == 23:\n    print(\"Christmas Eve Eve\")\nelif D == 22:\n    print(\"Christmas Eve Eve Eve\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program reads an integer from the input, and then checks if it equals 25, 24, 23, or 22. Depending on the result, it prints \"Christmas\", \"Christmas Eve\", \"Christmas Eve Eve\", or \"Christmas Eve Eve Eve\" to the output.\n\nThis program is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. It is designed to be easy to understand and read, which makes it a good choice for beginners.\n\nThe program uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to check the value of the input. If the value matches one of the cases, the corresponding message is printed to the output.\n\nThe input is read using the `input()` function, and the value is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.\n\nThe output is printed using the `print()` function.\n\nThe program does not use any external libraries or modules, and does not handle any exceptions.\n\nThe program does not use any variables that are not necessary for the program to work, and does not use any data structures.\n\nThe program is simple and does not include any unnecessary complexity. It is a good example of how to solve a simple problem using", "print(\"Christmas\"[::-1][25 - int(input())::5])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe input is read and stored in a variable 'D'. Then, a string \"Christmas\" is sliced in reverse order and sliced from the end according to the value of 'D'. The step size is calculated as 5 - 'D'. This gives the appropriate number of characters to slice off from the end of \"Christmas\". The sliced part is printed as the output.\n\nFor example, if 'D' = 25, the step size is 0 (as we need to slice the entire string), and the output is \"Christmas\". If 'D' = 24, the step size is 1 (we need to slice off one character from the end), and the output is \"Christmas Eve\". If 'D' = 23, the step size is 2 (we need to slice off two characters from the end), and the output is \"Christmas Eve Eve\". If 'D' = 22, the step size is 3 (we need to slice off three characters from the end), and the output is \"Christmas Eve Eve Eve\".\n\nThis solution works because the string \"Christmas\" is reversed and sliced from the end according to the value of 'D'. The step size is calculated as 5 - 'D' to give the appropriate number of characters to slice off from the end of the string. The sliced part is then printed as the output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input 'D' is an integer between 22 and 25 inclusive.
