Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!\n\nHeidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!\n\nThe funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.\n\nThe first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10$).\n\nEach of the following $4n + 1$ lines contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($0 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 50$), describing the coordinates of the next point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are at least $n$ points on each side of the square and all $4n + 1$ points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2 0\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n1 1\n\nInput\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n0 3\n1 0\n1 2\n2 0\n2 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n0 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn both examples, the square has four sides $x=0$, $x=2$, $y=0$, $y=2$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
