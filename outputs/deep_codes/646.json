It can be proven that it is impossible to check all detachments for $t < 100$; thus the answer is $100$.\n\nIn the second test, there is no such $t$ that it is possible to check all detachments, even with adding at most one new detachment, so the answer is $-1$.\n\nIn the third test, it is possible to place a detachment in $(1, 0)$, so that Brimstone can check all the detachments for $t = 2$. It can be proven that it is the minimal such $t$.\n\nIn the fourth test, there is no need to add any detachments, because the answer will not get better ($t = 2$). It can be proven that it is the minimal such $t$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
