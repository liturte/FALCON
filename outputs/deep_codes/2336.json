The first one, \"wikiHow to make Cold Brew Coffee\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly 1 degree.  The second one, \"What good is coffee that isn't brewed at at least 36.3306 times the temperature of the surface of the sun?\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly 200000 degrees. \n\nA temperature is admissible if at least 1 recipe recommends it.\n\nIn her first and only question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures that are actually reasonable.
