Therefore, the distance from the back to the (i-th) car is N - i + 1.\n\nThe map function is used to read in the input values as integers.

It then prints the value of j.\n\nThe line `N, i = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input separated by a space. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the input, converting them to integers. The `split` function splits the input on spaces, so the first element of the input is the number of cars in the train (N), and the second element is the position of the car from the front (i).\n\nThe line `j = N - i + 1` calculates the position of the car from the back. This is done by subtracting the position of the car from the front (i) from the total number of cars (N) and adding 1.\n\nThe line `print(j)` prints the position of the car from the back.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be in the correct format as described in the problem statement.

This formula is derived from the fact that the i-th car from the front of the train is the (N - i + 1)-th car from the back.
