{"4265": {"code": ["s = input()\nt = input()\nprint(sum(x != y for x, y in zip(s, t)))\n\n\nThis Python program reads two strings `s` and `t` from the standard input. It then calculates the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ by counting the number of positions where `x != y` in the `zip` object `zip(s, t)`, which pairs up corresponding characters from `s` and `t`. The sum of these counts is then printed as the minimum number of operations required to change `s` to `t` by replacing characters.\n\nThe `zip` function is a built-in Python function that creates an iterator that generates tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The `sum` function is a built-in Python function that adds the elements of an iterable and returns the sum. The `(x != y for x, y in zip(s, t))` generator expression generates a sequence of Boolean values indicating whether the corresponding characters in `s` and `t` differ.\n\nThis solution has a time", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s != t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nThis solution works by using a generator expression to create a sequence of boolean values, where each boolean value is True if the corresponding characters in S and T are not equal, and False otherwise. The sum function then adds up these boolean values to give the total number of operations required.\n\nThis solution assumes that the lengths of S and T are equal, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.\n\nThis solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of S and T. This is because it needs to compare each character in S and T.\n\nThis solution uses O(n) extra space to store the boolean values. This is necessary because the sum function needs to create these boolean values.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test case\nprint(sum(s != t for s, t in zip(\"cupofcoffee\", \"cupofhottea\")))\n\n\nThis will print the number of operations required to transform \"cupofcoffee\" into \"cupofhottea\".\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# Test case\nprint(sum(", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s != t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over both strings at the same time. It then uses a generator expression to compare each pair of characters. If they are not equal, it counts the pair. The sum function then adds up these counts, giving the total number of changes required.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because we are iterating over each character in the strings once.\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n), because we are storing the characters of the strings in memory.\n\nThe solution assumes that the inputs are valid and as per the constraints.\n\nThis solution does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur. For a more robust solution, you would need to add error checking and handling code.\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------------------------\n# Solution\n# -------------------------\n\nS = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s != t for s, t in zip(S, T)))", "s = input()\nt = input()\nprint(sum(x != y for x, y in zip(s, t)))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses the built-in `zip` function in Python to iterate over the corresponding characters in `s` and `t` simultaneously. It then counts the number of characters for which these two characters are not equal. This count is the minimum number of operations required to change `s` to `t`.\n\nNOTE: This solution assumes that the strings `s` and `t` have equal lengths, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe `sum` function is used to add up the counts, which is equivalent to the total number of operations required.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings, as it iterates over each character in the strings once. This is considered efficient for the given constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the solution\ns = \"cupofcoffee\"\nt = \"cupofhottea\"\nprint(sum(x != y for x, y in zip(s, t)))  # Output: 4", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s != t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two strings simultaneously. It then uses the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of positions where the characters in the strings are not equal. The result is printed out.\n\nThis solution assumes that the strings `S` and `T` are of equal length, as specified in the problem statement. If this assumption does not hold, additional error checking or exception handling should be added.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the operation is to replace one character in `S` with another character to make it match `T`, as specified in the problem statement. If this assumption does not hold, additional logic should be added to handle different operations.\n\nThis solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings. It does not use any additional space, so its space complexity is O(1).\n\nNote: The problem statement mentions changing S to T by repeating the operation.
