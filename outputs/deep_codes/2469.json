If the count is 0, it sets the current element as the new candidate.\n\nFinally, it returns a", "class Solution:\n    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        if not nums:\n            return []\n        count1, count2, candidate1, candidate2 = 0, 0, None, None\n        for n in nums:\n            if n == candidate1:\n                count1 += 1\n            elif n == candidate2:\n                count2 += 1\n            elif count1 == 0:\n                candidate1, count1 = n, 1\n            elif count2 == 0:\n                candidate2, count2 = n, 1\n            else:\n                count1, count2 = count1-1, count2-1\n        return [n for n in (candidate1, candidate2)\n                    if nums.count(n) > len(nums) // 3]\n\n\nThis solution uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for finding the majority element in an array. It works by iterating over the array and keeping track of the current candidates for the majority element and their counts. If it encounters a number that is not one of the current candidates, it decrements the count of the current candidates. If a count reaches 0, it replaces the candidate. At the end, it checks if the candidates are indeed the majority elements by counting their occurrences in the array.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space", "class Solution:\n    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        count1, count2, candidate1, candidate2 = 0, 0, None, None\n        \n        for n in nums:\n            if n == candidate1:\n                count1 += 1\n            elif n == candidate2:\n                count2 += 1\n            elif count1 == 0:\n                candidate1, count1 = n, 1\n            elif count2 == 0:\n                candidate2, count2 = n, 1\n            else:\n                count1, count2 = count1 - 1, count2 - 1\n                \n        return [n for n in (candidate1, candidate2)\n                       if nums.count(n) > len(nums) // 3]\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem requires finding the elements that appear more than n/3 times in the array, where n is the size of the array. The problem can be solved using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm uses two counters and two candidates to keep track of the elements that have the highest frequency. It iterates over the array and updates the counters and candidates accordingly. If the counter of a candidate becomes zero, it replaces the candidate with the current number.\n\nAfter the iteration, the algorithm checks if the candidates appear more than n/3 times in the array. If yes, it returns the candidates.\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time and uses O", "class Solution:\n    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        if not nums:\n            return []\n        count1, count2, candidate1, candidate2 = 0, 0, None, None\n        for n in nums:\n            if n == candidate1:\n                count1 += 1\n            elif n == candidate2:\n                count2 += 1\n            elif count1 == 0:\n                candidate1, count1 = n, 1\n            elif count2 == 0:\n                candidate2, count2 = n, 1\n            else:\n                count1, count2 = count1 - 1, count2 - 1\n        return [n for n in (candidate1, candidate2)\n                      if nums.count(n) > len(nums) // 3]\n\n\nIn this code, we use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to solve this problem. We maintain two counters for the two majority elements we are looking for. We update these counters based on the elements we are seeing in the array.
