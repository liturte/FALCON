Vertex 1 is the root of the tree, and the parent of Vertex i (2 \\leq i \\leq N) is Vertex P_i.\nTo each vertex in the tree, Snuke will allocate a color, either black or white, and a non-negative integer weight.\nSnuke has a favorite integer sequence, X_1, X_2, ..., X_N, so he wants to allocate colors and weights so that the following condition is satisfied for all v.\n - The total weight of the vertices with the same color as v among the vertices contained in the subtree whose root is v, is X_v.\nHere, the subtree whose root is v is the tree consisting of Vertex v and all of its descendants.\nDetermine whether it is possible to allocate colors and weights in this way.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 1 000\n - 1 \\leq P_i \\leq i - 1\n - 0 \\leq X_i \\leq 5 000\n\n-----Inputs-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nP_2 P_3 ... P_N\nX_1 X_2 ... X_N\n\n-----Outputs-----\nIf it is possible to allocate colors and weights to the vertices so that the condition is satisfied, print POSSIBLE; otherwise, print IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 1\n4 3 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nPOSSIBLE\n\nFor example, the following allocation satisfies the condition:\n - Set the color of Vertex 1 to white and its weight to 2.\n - Set the color of Vertex 2 to black and its weight to 3.\n - Set the color of Vertex 3 to white and its weight to 2.\nThere are also other possible allocations.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
