Let's call a number d-magic if digit d appears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere else.\n\nFor example, the numbers 1727374, 17, 1 are 7-magic but 77, 7, 123, 34, 71 are not 7-magic. On the other hand the number 7 is 0-magic, 123 is 2-magic, 34 is 4-magic and 71 is 1-magic.\n\nFind the number of d-magic numbers in the segment [a, b] that are multiple of m. Because the answer can be very huge you should only find its value modulo 10^9 + 7 (so you should find the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers m, d (1 \u2264 m \u2264 2000, 0 \u2264 d \u2264 9) \u2014 the parameters from the problem statement.\n\nThe second line contains positive integer a in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).\n\nThe third line contains positive integer b in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).\n\nIt is guaranteed that a \u2264 b, the number of digits in a and b are the same and don't exceed 2000.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer a \u2014 the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7 of the number of d-magic numbers in segment [a, b] that are multiple of m.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 6\n10\n99\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n2 0\n1\n9\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n19 7\n1000\n9999\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe numbers from the answer of the first example are 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 76, 86 and 96.\n\nThe numbers from the answer of the second example are 2, 4, 6 and 8.\n\nThe numbers from the answer of the third example are 1767, 2717, 5757, 6707, 8797 and 9747.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
