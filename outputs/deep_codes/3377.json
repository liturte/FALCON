Each of the following $n$ lines contains an integer $p$ ($0 \\leq p < n$) and a list of $p$ integers. If line $i$ contains $x_1,\\ldots ,x_ p$ ($1 \\leq x_ j < i$), then all points $x_ j$ need to have a peg in order to place a peg in point $i$.\n\nThe next line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$), the number of steps in the safe dry plan. Each of the following $t$ lines contains an integer $i$, meaning that a peg is being placed or removed from point $i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is no safe wet plan using at most $10$ times the number of pegs of the safe dry plan, output $-1$.
