He has no camera, so he begins writing down coordinate points. Fortunately for Garry, the current cloud cover can be represented as the union of non-intersecting, non-degenerate triangles where each vertex is at a coordinate point on the $xy$-plane. Two triangles are considered non-intersecting if their intersection has area $0$. A triangle is degenerate if its area is $0$.\n\nThe next day, Garry\u2019s friend Jerry goes to look at the sky. Jerry also wishes to record the current state of the sky.
