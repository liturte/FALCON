You may do some operations with this string, for each operation you have to choose some character that still remains in the string. If you choose a character >, the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character <, the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).\n\nFor example, if we choose character > in string > > < >, the string will become to > > >. And if we choose character < in string > <, the string will become to <.\n\nThe string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings >, > > are good. \n\nBefore applying the operations, you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to $n - 1$, but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $s$ so that it becomes good.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2013 the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two lines.\n\nThe first line of $i$-th test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2013 the length of string $s$.\n\nThe second line of $i$-th test case contains string $s$, consisting of only characters > and <.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one line.\n\nFor $i$-th test case print the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $s$ so that it becomes good.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n2\n<>\n3\n><<\n1\n>\n\nOutput\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case we can delete any character in string <>.\n\nIn the second test case we don't need to delete any characters. The string > < < is good, because we can perform the following sequence of operations: > < < $\\rightarrow$ < < $\\rightarrow$ <.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
