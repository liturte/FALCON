So, he can prepare and pass all exams.\n\nIn the second example, there are three days and two exams. So, Petya can prepare in only one day (because in two other days he should pass exams). Then Petya can not prepare and pass all exams.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
