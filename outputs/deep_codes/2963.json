The equation is x^x = n, which can be rewritten as e^(log(n)/x) = n. Solving for x gives us the answer.\n\nThe math.exp function in Python returns the exponential of a number. The math.log function returns the natural logarithm of a number. We divide the natural logarithm of n by x to get the argument for the exponential function.\n\nThis solution uses the math library for the log and exp functions. It's a simple and efficient solution for this problem.\n\nPlease note that the precision of the result is limited by the precision of the underlying Python float type. The result will be correct up to the precision of the Python float type.\n\nAlso note that this code will run slowly for large inputs due to the complexity of the mathematical operations.

Therefore, to solve for $x$, we can take the nth root of the natural log of $n$. The math.pow function is used to compute the nth root.\n\nThis code also has a relative or absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$, which is the required precision for the problem.\n\nPlease note that Python's math.pow function uses the binary exponentiation method to compute the power, which is much more efficient than directly computing the power.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a valid integer and that the problem statement is understood correctly.

The solution to this problem is the $n$th root of $n$, which can be calculated using the power function in Python. The power function takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent. In this case, we want to raise $n$ to the power of $1/n$, which is the $n$th root of $n$. The math.pow function in Python can be used to calculate this.\n\nThe solution is wrapped in a function called \"solve\" that takes a number $n$ as input and returns the $n$th root of $n$. The number $n$ is read from the input, and the result is printed to the output.\n\nThe math module is imported at the start of the program to provide the power function.\n\nThe relative or absolute error of the solution is guaranteed to be at most $10^{-6}$ by the properties of floating-point arithmetic.\n\nThe limits of the problem are $1 \\leq n \\leq 10000000000$,"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nNeelix has been working on making the Altonian warp bubble power itself up.
