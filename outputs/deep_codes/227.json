Let's fix the set of variables b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. Initially each variable b_{i} (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.\n\nThe first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 \u2264 x \u2264 m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 \u2264 i, j, y \u2264 m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{k} \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single number \u2014 the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.\n\nIf you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any m, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 6 8\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3\n3 6 5\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n6\n2 4 8 6 10 18\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, you can use two variables b_1 and b_2 to perform the following sequence of operations.  b_1 := 1;  b_2 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2;  b_1 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
