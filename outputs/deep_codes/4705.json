Finally, it prints the difference between x and y.\n\nNote: The \"//\" operator is used for integer division in Python. This is because Snuke gets paid back for every 15 meals, but the number of meals is not necessarily a multiple of 15, so we need to round down to the nearest integer.\n\nThe code assumes that the input is a valid integer within the specified range (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100). If this is not the case, the code may not behave as expected.\n\nThe code does not include any error handling or input validation beyond checking that the input is", "N = int(input())\nx = 800 * N\ny = (N // 15) * 200\nprint(x - y)\n\nThis Python code takes an integer N as input, calculates the total amount of money Snuke has paid to the restaurant and the amount of money the restaurant has paid back to Snuke, and then prints the difference between these two amounts.\n\nThis code works by first calculating the total amount of money Snuke has paid to the restaurant by multiplying the number of meals by the price per meal. It then calculates the amount of money the restaurant has paid back to Snuke by dividing the total number of meals by 15 (since the restaurant pays 200 yen back for every 15 meals) and multiplying by 200. The difference between these two amounts is then calculated and printed.\n\nThe use of integer division (//) in Python ensures that the number of meals is divided without any remainder, which is necessary for the calculation of the amount of money the restaurant pays back to Snuke.\n\nThis code should work correctly for all valid inputs", "N = int(input())\nx = (N // 15) * 200\ny = N * 800\nprint(x - y)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of meals Snuke has ordered is given as `N`. To find out how much money Snuke has paid to the restaurant, we divide `N` by 15 (since each time a customer orders 15 meals, the restaurant pays 200 yen back to the customer) and multiply the result by 200.\n\nNext, to find out how much money the restaurant has paid back to Snuke, we multiply `N` by 800.\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount of money the restaurant has paid back to Snuke from the amount of money Snuke has paid to the restaurant to find the difference.\n\nThis solution is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\nN = int(input())\nx = (N // 15) * 200\ny = N * 800\nprint(x - y)"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke has a favorite restaurant.\nThe price of any meal served at the restaurant is 800 yen (the currency of Japan), and each time a customer orders 15 meals, the restaurant pays 200 yen back to the customer.\nSo far, Snuke has ordered N meals at the restaurant.\nLet the amount of money Snuke has paid to the restaurant be x yen, and let the amount of money the restaurant has paid back to Snuke be y yen.\nFind x-y.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n20\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n15800\n\nSo far, Snuke has paid 16000 yen, and the restaurant has paid back 200 yen.
