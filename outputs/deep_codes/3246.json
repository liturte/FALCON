For example, the sentence \u201ctihs snetncee mkaes prfecet sesne\u201d, makes perfect sense to most people. If you remove all spaces from a sentence, it still remains perfectly readable, see for example: \u201cthissentencemakesperfectsense\u201d, however if you combine these two things, first shuffling, then removing spaces, things get hard. The following sentence is harder to decipher: \u201ctihssnetnceemkaesprfecetsesne\u201d. You are given a sentence in the last form, together with a dictionary of valid words and are asked to decipher the text.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line with a string $s$: the sentence to decipher. The sentence consists of lowercase letters and has a length of at least $1$ and at most $1000$ characters.\n - One line with an integer $n$ with $1 \\le n \\le 10000$: the number of words in the dictionary.\n - $n$ lines with one word each. A word consists of lowercase letters and has a length of at least $1$ and at most $100$ characters. All the words are unique.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line with the deciphered sentence, if it is possible to uniquely decipher it. Otherwise \u201cimpossible\u201d or \u201cambiguous\u201d, depending on which is the case.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\ntihssnetnceemkaesprfecetsesne\n5\nmakes\nperfect\nsense\nsentence\nthis\nSample Output 1:\nthis sentence makes perfect sense\n\nSample Input 2:\nhitehre\n2\nthere\nhello\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
