The `sum` function then adds up the number of `True` values (i.e., the number of days for which the forecast was correct).\n\nThe `input` function reads a line from standard input, and `==` is the equality operator. It returns `True` if the two operands are equal and `False` otherwise. The `zip` function returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-", "S = input()\nT = input()\n\ncorrect = 0\nfor i in range(3):\n    if S[i] == T[i]:\n        correct += 1\n\nprint(correct)\n\n\nThis Python code reads the forecast and actual weather from the input, then compares the forecast and actual weather for each day. If the forecast matches the actual weather, it increments the `correct` count. Finally, it prints the number of days for which the forecast was correct.", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s == t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nThis Python program reads two strings `S` and `T` from the standard input, and then compares each corresponding character in `S` and `T`. If the characters are equal, it counts the comparison as a correct forecast. Finally, it prints the number of correct forecasts.\n\nThe `zip` function pairs corresponding characters from `S` and `T` together, and the `sum` function counts the number of times the comparison `s == t` is `True`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the forecasts are correct if the forecast and the actual weather match exactly. If", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s == t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nThis code works by taking the input for the forecast (S) and the actual weather (T). It then uses the zip function to pair up corresponding characters from S and T. The sum function is then used to count the number of pairs where the forecast (s) matches the actual weather (t). The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nFor example, given the inputs \"CSS\" and \"CSR\", the zip function would pair ('C', 'C') and ('S', 'S'), and the sum function would count these two pairs, resulting in the output \"2\".\n\nThis code assumes that", "S = input()\nT = input()\nprint(sum(s == t for s, t in zip(S, T)))\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `zip` function to pair up the corresponding characters from `S` and `T`. It then uses the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of pairs for which the forecast (`s`) matches the actual weather (`t`).\n\nThis solution assumes that the forecast and actual weather are given for the same days. If the days are not the same, the solution would need to be adapted.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., it will always be a string of length 3 consisting of"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou will be given a string S of length 3 representing the weather forecast for three days in the past.\nThe i-th character (1 \\leq i \\leq 3) of S represents the forecast for the i-th day.
