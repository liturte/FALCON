The teacher wanted to calm him down and \u201ctame\u201d him, so he has given him a difficult mathematical problem.\n\nThe teacher gives Slon an arithmetic expression $A$, the integer $P$ and $M$. Slon has to answer the following question: \u201cWhat is the minimal non-negative value of variable x in expression $A$ so that the remainder of dividing $A$ with $M$ is equal to $P$?\u201d. The solution will always exist.\n\nAdditionally, it will hold that, if we apply the laws of distribution on expression $A$, variable $x$ will not multiply variable $x$ (formally, the expression is a polynomial of the first degree in variable $x$).\n\nExamples of valid expressions: $5 + x \\cdot (3 + 2)$, $x + 3 \\cdot x + 4 \\cdot (5 + 3 \\cdot (2 + x - 2 \\cdot x))$.\n\nExamples of invalid expressions: $5 \\cdot (3 + x \\cdot (3 + x))$, $x \\cdot (x + x \\cdot (1 + x))$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the expression $A$ ($1 \\leq \\lvert A\\rvert \\leq 100000$). The second line of input contains two integers $P$ ($0 \\leq P \\leq M - 1$) and $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 1000000$). The arithmetic expression $A$ will only consists of characters +, -, *, (, ), x and digits from 0 to 9. The brackets will always be paired, the operators +, - and * will always be applied to exactly two values (there will not be an expression $(-5)$ or $(4+-5)$) and all multiplications will be explicit (there will not be an expression $4(5)$ or $2(x)$).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the minimal non-negative value of variable $x$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5+3+x\n9 10\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n20+3+x\n0 5\nSample Output 2:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
