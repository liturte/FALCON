Each place is either empty or occupied by a passenger.\n\nThe university team for the Olympiad consists of $a$ student-programmers and $b$ student-athletes. Determine the largest number of students from all $a+b$ students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that:  no student-programmer is sitting next to the student-programmer;  and no student-athlete is sitting next to the student-athlete. \n\nIn the other words, there should not be two consecutive (adjacent) places where two student-athletes or two student-programmers are sitting.\n\nConsider that initially occupied seat places are occupied by jury members (who obviously are not students at all).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contain three integers $n$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^{5}$, $0 \\le a, b \\le 2\\cdot10^{5}$, $a + b > 0$) \u2014 total number of seat places in the railway carriage, the number of student-programmers and the number of student-athletes.\n\nThe second line contains a string with length $n$, consisting of characters \".\" and \"*\". The dot means that the corresponding place is empty. The asterisk means that the corresponding place is occupied by the jury member.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the largest number of students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that no student-programmer is sitting next to a student-programmer and no student-athlete is sitting next to a student-athlete.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1 1\n*...*\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n6 2 3\n*...*.\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n11 3 10\n.*....**.*.\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n3 2 3\n***\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can put all student, for example, in the following way: *.AB*\n\nIn the second example you can put four students, for example, in the following way: *BAB*B\n\nIn the third example you can put seven students, for example, in the following way: B*ABAB**A*B\n\nThe letter A means a student-programmer, and the letter B \u2014 student-athlete.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
