It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of $2$ (i.e. $a_i = 2^d$ for some non-negative integer number $d$).\n\nPolycarp wants to know answers on $q$ queries. The $j$-th query is described as integer number $b_j$. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $b_j$ using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value $b_j$, the answer to the $j$-th query is -1.\n\nThe queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of coins and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ \u2014 values of coins ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$). It is guaranteed that all $a_i$ are integer powers of $2$ (i.e. $a_i = 2^d$ for some non-negative integer number $d$).\n\nThe next $q$ lines contain one integer each. The $j$-th line contains one integer $b_j$ \u2014 the value of the $j$-th query ($1 \\le b_j \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ integers $ans_j$. The $j$-th integer must be equal to the answer on the $j$-th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value $b_j$ the answer to the $j$-th query is -1.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 4\n2 4 8 2 4\n8\n5\n14\n10\n\nOutput\n1\n-1\n3\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
