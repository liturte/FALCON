He hadn't been solving problems for a long time, so he became interested to answer a particular question: how many triples of indices (i, \u00a0j, \u00a0k) (i < j < k), such that a_{i}\u00b7a_{j}\u00b7a_{k} is minimum possible, are there in the array? Help him with it!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer number n\u00a0(3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n positive integer numbers a_{i}\u00a0(1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the elements of a given array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number \u2014 the quantity of triples (i, \u00a0j, \u00a0k) such that i, \u00a0j and k are pairwise distinct and a_{i}\u00b7a_{j}\u00b7a_{k} is minimum possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5\n1 3 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n6\n1 3 3 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Makes always chooses three ones out of four, and the number of ways to choose them is 4.\n\nIn the second example a triple of numbers (1, 2, 3) is chosen (numbers, not indices). Since there are two ways to choose an element 3, then the answer is 2.\n\nIn the third example a triple of numbers (1, 1, 2) is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
