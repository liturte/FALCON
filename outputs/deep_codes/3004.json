The fence is composed of $10000$ contiguous sections, numbered from $1$ to $10000$.\n\nYou get some offers from painters to help paint the fence. Each painter offers to paint a contiguous subset of fence sections in a particular color. You need to accept a set of the offers, such that:\n - Each section of the fence is painted.\n - At most 3 colors are used to paint the fence.\n\nIf it is possible to satisfy these two requirements, find the minimum number of offers that you must accept.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$, the number of offers. Then follow $N$ lines, one for each offer, each containing \u201c$C$ $A$ $B$\u201d where $C$ is the color, which is an uppercase string of up to 10 letters, $A$ is the first section and $B$ is the last section to be painted. $1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 10000$.\n\nYou may assume that $1 \\leq N \\leq 300$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line containing the number of offers that need to be accepted, or \u201cIMPOSSIBLE\u201d if there is no acceptable set of offers.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\nBLUE 1 5000\nRED 5001 10000\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\nBLUE 1 6000\nRED 2000 8000\nWHITE 7000 10000\nSample Output 2:\n3\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\nBLUE 1 3000\nRED 2000 5000\nORANGE 4000 8000\nGREEN 7000 10000\nSample Output 3:\nIMPOSSIBLE\n\nSample Input 4:\n2\nBLUE 1 4000\nRED 4002 10000\nSample Output 4:\nIMPOSSIBLE\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
