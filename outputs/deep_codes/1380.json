At that, the i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) tree from the left has height a_{i} meters. Today the Queen decided to update the scenery of her garden. She wants the trees' heights to meet the condition: for all i (1 \u2264 i < n), a_{i} + 1 - a_{i} = k, where k is the number the Queen chose.\n\nUnfortunately, the royal gardener is not a machine and he cannot fulfill the desire of the Queen instantly! In one minute, the gardener can either decrease the height of a tree to any positive integer height or increase the height of a tree to any positive integer height. How should the royal gardener act to fulfill a whim of Her Majesty in the minimum number of minutes?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: n, k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 1000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000) \u2014 the heights of the trees in the row. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single integer p \u2014 the minimum number of minutes the gardener needs. In the next p lines print the description of his actions. \n\nIf the gardener needs to increase the height of the j-th (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) tree from the left by x (x \u2265 1) meters, then print in the corresponding line \"+\u00a0j\u00a0x\". If the gardener needs to decrease the height of the j-th (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) tree from the left by x (x \u2265 1) meters, print on the corresponding line \"-\u00a0j\u00a0x\".\n\nIf there are multiple ways to make a row of trees beautiful in the minimum number of actions, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 1\n1 2 1 5\n\nOutput\n2\n+ 3 2\n- 4 1\n\nInput\n4 1\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
