Then at time 0, the speed of the first person becomes 1000 and he reaches the point 10^6 at the time 600. The bomb will not affect on the second person, and he will reach the 0 point at the time 500000.\n\nIn the second example, it is optimal to place the bomb at the point 500000. The rays will catch up with both people at the time 200. At this time moment, the first is at the point with a coordinate of 300000, and the second is at the point with a coordinate of 700000. Their speed will become 1500 and at the time 400 they will simultaneously run through points 0 and 10^6.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
