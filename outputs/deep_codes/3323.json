In preparation, you are making a drink by mixing together three different types of fruit juice: Apple, Banana, and Carrot. Let\u2019s name the juices A, B and C.\n\nYou want to decide what fraction of the drink should be made from each type of juice, in such a way that the maximum possible number of people attending the party like it.\n\nEach person has a minimum fraction of each of the 3 juices they would like to have in the drink. They will only like the drink if the fraction of each of the 3 juices in the drink is greater or equal to their minimum fraction for that juice.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of people that you can satisfy.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing an integer $T$, the number of test cases in the input file.\n\nFor each test case, there will be:\n - One line containing the integer $N$, the number of people going to the party.\n - $N$ lines, one for each person, each containing three space-separated numbers \u201c$A$ $B$ $C$\u201d, indicating the minimum fraction of each juice that would like in the drink. $A$, $B$ and $C$ are integers between $0$ and $10000$ inclusive, indicating the fraction in parts-per-ten-thousand. $A + B + C \\leq 10000$.\n\nYou may assume that $1 \\leq T \\leq 2$ and $1 \\leq N \\leq 5000$.\n\n-----Output-----\n - $T$ lines, one for each test case in the order they occur in the input file, each containing the string \u201cCase #$X$: $Y$\u201d where $X$ is the number of the test case, starting from 1, and $Y$ is the maximum number of people who will like your drink.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n3\n10000 0 0\n0 10000 0\n0 0 10000\n3\n5000 0 0\n0 2000 0\n0 0 4000\nSample Output:\nCase #1: 1\nCase #2: 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
