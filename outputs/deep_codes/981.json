Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. \n\nUnfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires a_{d} liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.\n\nHelp Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a positive integer v (0 \u2264 v \u2264 10^6). The second line contains nine positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_9 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n55555\n\nInput\n2\n9 11 1 12 5 8 9 10 6\n\nOutput\n33\n\nInput\n0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
