For this task we are using a simplified formula for calculating the impact factor:\\[ \\frac{\\text {Total count of citations received by articles published in the journal}}{\\text {Total number of articles published}} \\]\n\nRounding is always performed upwards. For example the impact factor of the \u201cJournal for ore research and time wasting\u201d that published $38$ articles cited $894$ times is $894 / 38 = 23.53$ rounding up to $24$.\n\nYou are the editor of one scientific journal. You know how many articles you are going to publish and the owners are pushing you to reach a specific impact factor. You are wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite your articles to meet the owners demands. Since money is tight you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists. Each bribed scientist buys you a single citation.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst and only line of input will contain $2$ integers, $A$ ($1 \\leq A \\leq 100$), the number of articles you plan to publish and $I$ ($1 \\leq I \\leq 100$), the impact factor the owners require.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain one integer, the minimal number of scientists you need to bribe.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n38 24\nSample Output 1:\n875\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 100\nSample Output 2:\n100\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
