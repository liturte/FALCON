It is now hours after the polls have closed and a winner has yet to emerge! \n\nIn their desperation, the election officials turn to you and ask you to write a program to count the vote!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case, which is a list of votes cast. Each line in the input contains the name of a candidate for whom a vote was cast. A name may consist of multiple words, separated by spaces. Words contain letters or hyphens, but no other punctuation characters. There will be at least $2$ votes on the list. The list of votes ends with a single line containing the characters ***. This line should not be counted. There can be up to $100000$ valid votes.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf a candidate obtained a simple or absolute majority of all votes cast (that is, more than any other candidate), output the name of this candidate! If no candidate obtained a simple majority, output: \u201cRunoff!\u201d (don\u2019t forget to include the exclamation mark!)\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nPenny Franklin\nMarti Graham\nConnie Froggatt\nJoseph Ivers\nConnie Froggatt\nPenny Franklin\nConnie Froggatt\nBruce Stanger\nConnie Froggatt\nBarbara Skinner\nBarbara Skinner\n***\nSample Output:\nConnie Froggatt\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
