That is, for each i = 0, 1, ..., r-l, the (l + i)-th person from the west will stand the (r - i)-th from the west after the operation, facing east if he/she is facing west now, and vice versa.\nWhat is the maximum possible number of happy people you can have?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer satisfying 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5.\n - K is an integer satisfying 1 \\leq K \\leq 10^5.\n - |S| = N\n - Each character of S is L or R.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum possible number of happy people after at most K operations.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6 1\nLRLRRL\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nIf we choose (l, r) = (2, 5), we have LLLRLL, where the 2-nd, 3-rd, and 6-th persons from the west are happy.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
