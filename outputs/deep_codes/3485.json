Their latest invention is a fast-paced game of chance called Stop Counting!, where a single customer plays with a dealer who has a deck of cards. Each card has some integer value.\n\nOne by one, the dealer reveals the cards in the deck in order, and keeps track of the sum of the played cards and the number of cards shown. At some point before a card is dealt, the player can call \u201cStop Counting!\u201d After this, the dealer continues displaying cards in order, but does not include them in the running sums. At some point after calling \u201cStop Counting!\u201d, and just before another card is dealt, the player can also call \u201cStart Counting!\u201d and the dealer then includes subsequent cards in the totals.
