The number of combinations of a group of 5, 6, or 7 people is always the same, which is 21. Therefore, the number of combinations of a group of n people is n - 6. If n is less than 7, there are no combinations, so the function returns 0. If n is 7, there is one combination, so the function returns 1.\n\nThe code takes an input n, calculates the number of combinations using the function, and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the number of people in a group is always greater than or equal to 5. If there could be a case where a group of less than 5 people could be created, you would need to add additional code to handle that case.", "def count_variants(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 7:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return (n-6)*(n-7)//2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(count_variants(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn this problem, we are given a number of resumes (n) and we need to count the number of different ways we can form a group of 5 to 7 people from these resumes. This is a combinatorics problem. The number of ways to form a group of 5 or 6 people from n resumes is (n choose 5) or (n choose 6), respectively. For a group of 7 people, it's (n choose 7). We need to add these three quantities together to get the total number of ways to form a group of 5 to 7 people.\n\nThe Python function count_variants(n) implements this logic. If n is less than 7, there are no ways to form a group of 5 to 7 people, so the function returns 0. If n is exactly 7, there is only one way to form a group of 7 people, so the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function calculates the number of ways to form a group of 5 to 7 people by subtracting 6 from n and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 6", "def count_variants(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 7:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return (n-6) * (n-7) // 2\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(count_variants(n))\n\n\nThis program works by first checking if the number of resumes is less than 7. If it is, there are no possible group compositions, so it returns 0. If the number of resumes is 7, there is only one possible group composition, so it returns 1. For any number greater than 7, it calculates the number of possible group compositions by subtracting 6 and 7 from the number of resumes and dividing by 2 (since the order of the group members doesn't matter). This gives the number of ways to choose 5 or 6 members from the total number of resumes.\n\nThis solution assumes that the number of potential employees that sent resumes is always greater than or equal to 7. If this is not the case, the program could be modified to handle that situation.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the group must consist of at least 5 members and at most 7 members. If this is not the case, the program could be modified to handle that situation.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the number of potential employees that sent resumes is always greater than or equal to 7.

The result is the total number of different variants of group composition.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the number of resumes is always greater than or equal to the group size. If that's not the case, you would need to add an additional check to handle that.", "def count_combinations(n):\n    return (n - 3) * (n - 4) * (n - 5) // 6\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(count_combinations(n))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe number of combinations of 5 or 6 people out of n is given by the formula (n-3) * (n-4) * (n-5) // 6. The \"//\" operator is used for integer division. This formula is based on the fact that there are (n-3) ways to choose the leader, (n-4) ways to choose the second person (not the leader), and (n-5) ways to choose the remaining 3 people (not the leader or the second person). The \"// 6\" part is to account for the fact that we are considering groups of 5 or 6 people, not 3, 4, or 5.\n\nThis solution assumes that the group size can be 5 or 6 people. If the group size must be exactly 5 or 6 people, you would need a different formula.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the company can hire at least 3 people, and that the leader and the second person are not the same person.
