{"1585": {"code": ["import sys\n\nX, Y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\ndef solve(X, Y):\n    if Y // X == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 2\n\nprint(solve(X, Y))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads the input and checks if the division of Y by X is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1 because the sequence will only have one number (X). If the division is not equal to 0, it returns 2 because the sequence will have two numbers (X and the next multiple of X).\n\nThe problem is asking for the maximum length of the sequence, which is 2 in this case.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input values X and Y are integers and that X is less than or equal to Y and that X and Y are within the range of 1 to 10^18.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space.\n\nPlease note that this solution is based on the assumption that the sequence A should consist of integers between X and Y (inclusive). If the sequence", "import math\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(math.floor(math.log(Y / X) / math.log(2)))\n\nThis code snippet solves the problem by applying the mathematical theory of sequences and logarithms. It calculates the maximum possible length of the sequence by determining the number of times an element in the sequence can be doubled before it exceeds Y. The result is the maximum possible length of the sequence.\n\nThe math.log function calculates the logarithm of a number with a specified base. The math.floor function rounds down the result to the nearest integer.\n\nThe input function is used to read the values of X and Y from the standard input. The map function is used to convert the input strings to integers.\n\nThe code assumes that the input values are valid and does not include error checking for invalid input.", "import math\n\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef calc(X, Y):\n    cnt = 0\n    while X <= Y:\n        X *= 2\n        cnt += 1\n    return cnt\n\nprint(calc(X, Y))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a problem of binary search. The key to solve this problem is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the binary representation of Y, and then add 1 to it, because the next number should be greater than the previous one and a multiple of it.\n\nIn the given sample input, the binary representation of 20 is 10100, which contains 2 consecutive 1s. So, the maximum possible length of the sequence is 2+1=3.\n\nThe Python code uses a while loop to repeatedly multiply X by 2 until it is greater than Y. The counter cnt is incremented by 1 for each multiplication. The final value of cnt is the maximum possible length of the sequence.\n\nThis solution assumes that X and Y are positive integers and that X is less than or equal to Y. If X is greater than Y, the function calc(X, Y) will return 0.\n\nThe time complexity of", "def solve(X, Y):\n    count = 0\n    while X <= Y:\n        X *= 2\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(X, Y))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of a sequence that satisfies the conditions given. The condition is that each number in the sequence is a multiple of the previous number and is strictly greater than the previous number. \n\nThe solution provided is a Python code that solves the problem. It uses a while loop to keep multiplying the starting number (X) by 2 until it exceeds the upper limit (Y). The count variable keeps track of the number of times the loop has run, which is the maximum possible length of the sequence. The function returns the count.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input in the format specified, and the maximum possible length of the sequence is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be integers in the range 1 to 10^18, inclusive, and that the starting number (X) is less than or equal to the ending number (Y).\n\nPlease note that this solution is based on the assumption that the problem statement is correct and that the input is", "import math\n\nX, Y = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef solve(x, y):\n    count = 0\n    while x <= y:\n        x *= 2\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(solve(X, Y))\n\n\nThis code works by continuously doubling the current value `x` until it exceeds `y`. The number of iterations gives the length of the sequence. The `solve` function takes `x` and `y` as input and returns the maximum possible length of the sequence. The inputs are read from the standard input and passed to the `solve` function. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis code assumes that `x` and `y` are non-negative integers and that `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The `solve` function does not check these conditions. If `x` is not a power of 2, the function will return an incorrect result. However, the code does not handle this case.\n\nNote: This code uses Python's built-in `map` function to read two space-separated integers from the standard input, and uses the `math` module to calculate the logarithm base 2 of an integer.
