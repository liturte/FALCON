But it is impossible to get to the $3$-rd column because $|h_2 - h_3| = 3 > k$ and there is no way to decrease the gap.\n\nIn the fifth case, the character is already on the $n$-th column from the start so the game is won instantly.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
