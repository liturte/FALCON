An array $A$ of $N$ non-negative integers is $K_ S$-smooth if the sum of every set of $K$ consecutive integers is exactly $S$. Unfortunately, not all arrays are $K_ S$-smooth. In fact, all $K_ S$-smooth arrays must contain a repeating pattern of length $K$. The image to the right shows an array of smoothies, and is totally unrelated to this problem, but may help you relax. \n\nAny array can be made $K_ S$-smooth by changing its elements. In each change one element may be modified to any integer between $0$ and $S$, inclusive. You want to make all of your arrays smooth, but you don\u2019t want to make any more changes than necessary. So the question is: What is the minimum number of changes you have to make so that a given array would become $K_ S$-smooth?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input will consist of three integers of the form:\\[ N\\; \\; K\\; \\; S \\]\n\nwhere $N$ is the size of the array, The remainder of the file will consist of $N$ integers, $a_ n\\in A$, separated by white space. All input will be within the following constraints:\\[ 1 \\le K \\le N \\le 5000 \\]\\[ \\forall a_ n \\in A,\\; 0 \\le a_ n \\le S \\le 5000 \\]\n\n-----Output-----\nYour program must output a single integer specifying the minimum number of changes that must be made in order to make the array $K_ S$ smooth.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 5\n1\n2\n3\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n6 3 5\n1\n2\n3\n3\n2\n1\nSample Output 2:\n3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
