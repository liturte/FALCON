It increments the year by 1 and checks if the number of 0s in the string representation of the new year is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns the number of years until the next lucky year. If not, the function repeats the process with the new year. The `print` statement calls this function with the input year and prints the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input year is a positive integer.

It does this by converting the year to a string, creating a set from the characters in the string (which removes duplicates), and checking if the length of the set is 1. If the length is 1, then all the digits in the year are the same, and the year is not lucky. So, the code increments the year again and checks again. It repeats this process until it finds a year that is lucky. The function then returns the number of years that have passed until the next lucky year.\n\nPlease note that the `set(str(year))` part of the code removes the non-unique digits in the year, so"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nApart from having lots of holidays throughout the year, residents of Berland also have whole lucky years. Year is considered lucky if it has no more than 1 non-zero digit in its number. So years 100, 40000, 5 are lucky and 12, 3001 and 12345 are not.\n\nYou are given current year in Berland. Your task is to find how long will residents of Berland wait till the next lucky year.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2014 current year in Berland.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput amount of years from the current year to the next lucky one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n201\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n4000\n\nOutput\n1000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example next lucky year is 5. In the second one \u2014 300. In the third \u2014 5000.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
