To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \\frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
