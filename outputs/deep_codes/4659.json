If `numRows` is greater than 0, it initializes `res` with the first row of the triangle ([1]). Then, for each subsequent row in the triangle, it appends a new row to `res`. This new row is constructed by starting with [1], then adding the sum of each pair of numbers from the previous row, and finally adding [1]. Finally, it returns `res`, which now contains the first `numRows` rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\nThis solution uses list comprehension to generate the new row of the triangle, which is more efficient than using a loop.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(numRows^2), as it generates each row of the triangle in a loop that runs `numRows` times, and for each row, it generates a new list that contains `numRows` elements. The space complexity is also O(numRows^2), as it stores all the rows of the triangle in `res`.\n\nNote:", "class Solution:\n    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        if numRows == 0:\n            return []\n        result = [[1]]\n        for i in range(1, numRows):\n            last_row = result[-1]\n            new_row = [1]\n            for j in range(len(last_row) - 1):\n                new_row.append(last_row[j] + last_row[j+1])\n            new_row.append(1)\n            result.append(new_row)\n        return result\n\n\nThis solution starts by checking if numRows is 0, in which case it returns an empty list. Then it starts by creating the first row of the triangle, which is always [1]. It then enters a loop that will create the remaining rows of the triangle. For each row, it takes the last row that was created, and creates a new row. This new row starts with 1, and then for each pair of numbers in the last row, it adds their sum to the new row. It then adds 1 to the end of the new row. Finally, it adds the new row to the result and continues until it has created the desired number of rows.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(numRows^2), because it needs to create each row by iterating over the last row, and each row has numRows elements.

For each row, it first gets the last row of the result (which is the previous row in the triangle). Then, it creates a new row by adding 1 at the beginning and end of the row, and summing up the two numbers directly above each element in the row. Finally, it appends the new row to the result.\n\nThe base cases are when numRows is 0 or 1, in which case it returns an empty list or a list with a single row, respectively.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it iterates through each row and for each row, it iterates through each element in the row to calculate the new value. The space complexity is O(n^2) because it stores the entire triangle in memory.\n\nNote: This code assumes"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven a non-negative integer\u00a0numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.\n\n\nIn Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.\n\nExample:\n\n\nInput: 5\nOutput:\n[\n     [1],\n    [1,1],\n   [1,2,1],\n  [1,3,3,1],\n [1,4,6,4,1]\n]\nSTARTER CODE:\nclass Solution:\n    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        \n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
