We'll denote the i-th element of permutation p as p_{i}. We'll call number n the size or the length of permutation p_1,  p_2,  ...,  p_{n}.\n\nPetya decided to introduce the sum operation on the set of permutations of length n. Let's assume that we are given two permutations of length n: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} and b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. Petya calls the sum of permutations a and b such permutation c of length n, where c_{i} = ((a_{i} - 1 + b_{i} - 1) mod n) + 1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).\n\nOperation $x \\text{mod} y$ means taking the remainder after dividing number x by number y.\n\nObviously, not for all permutations a and b exists permutation c that is sum of a and b. That's why Petya got sad and asked you to do the following: given n, count the number of such pairs of permutations a and b of length n, that exists permutation c that is sum of a and b. The pair of permutations x, y (x \u2260 y) and the pair of permutations y, x are considered distinct pairs.\n\nAs the answer can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 16).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print a single non-negative integer \u2014 the number of such pairs of permutations a and b, that exists permutation c that is sum of a and b, modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n18\n\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n1800\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
