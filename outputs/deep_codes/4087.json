It uses a helper function nearest_interesting_number to do this. The helper function takes a number as input and returns the nearest interesting number. It converts the number to a string, splits it into digits, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them. If the sum is divisible by 4, it returns the number. Otherwise, it increments the number by one and repeats the process.\n\nThe main part of the code reads the given", "def nearest_interesting_number(a):\n    while True:\n        if sum(map(int, str(a))) % 4 == 0:\n            return a\n        a += 1\n\nprint(nearest_interesting_number(int(input())))\n\n\nThis program works by incrementing the input number `a` until it finds a number whose sum of digits is divisible by 4. The `sum(map(int, str(a))) % 4 == 0` checks if the sum of the digits of `a` is divisible by 4. If it is, the program returns `a` as the nearest interesting number. If not, it increments `a` and checks again. The program continues this process until it finds a number that is interesting.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input number `a` is already interesting.

This means that the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, which is also the condition for the number to be interesting. Therefore, the resulting number is the smallest interesting number greater or equal to the input.\n\nPlease note that the time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number.

He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $4$, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $n$ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $4$.\n\nHelp Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. That is, find the interesting number $n$ such that $n \\ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line in the input contains an integer $a$ ($1 \\le a \\le 1000$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $a$.
