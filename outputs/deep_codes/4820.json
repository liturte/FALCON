If b is 0, then it's possible to compress all files to 0 bits (because we can just remove all files).

The main idea is to represent each file as a binary number and then compress them. The compressed file size is determined by the number of \"1\"s in the", "def solve(N, b):\n    if N <= 1 or b == 0:\n        return \"yes\"\n    else:\n        return \"no\"\n\nN, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(N, b))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis is a very basic problem. The maximum size of a compressed file can be no more than 50 bits. So, if the maximum size is 0, it is possible to compress all the files into 0 bits (in other words, all files can be empty).

Especially not if you have \u201cfriends\u201d who repeatedly insist on showing you their new \u201cproofs\u201d that P equals NP, that the Riemann Hypothesis is true, and so on.\n\nOne of your friends recently claims to have found a fantastic new compression algorithm. As an example of its amazing performance, your friend has told you that every file in your precious collection of random bit strings after compression would be at most $b$ bits long! Naturally, you find this a bit hard to believe, so you want to determine whether it is even theoretically possible for this to be true.\n\nYour collection of random bit strings consists of $N$ files, no two of which are identical, and each of which is exactly $1000$ bits long.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two integers $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 10^{15}$) and $b$ ($0 \\le b \\le 50$), giving the number of files in your collection and the maximum number of bits a compressed file is allowed to have.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a line containing either \u201cyes\u201d if it is possible to compress all the $N$ files in your collection into files of size at most $b$ bits, or \u201cno\u201d otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n13 3\nSample Output 1:\nyes\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 0\nSample Output 2:\nyes\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
