In each round of the game, each player flips a biased coin and loses a life if she gets tails. The game ends when only one player remains, in which case this person wins, or ends in a draw if all remaining players lose their last life in the same round. If there is a winner, she wins $n$ times her original bet. In case of a draw, no one wins anything.\n\nBeing a BAPC member you quickly realize the casino has an edge here: whenever the game ends in a draw all of the contestants lose the money they bet. You are now wondering what exactly is the probability that this game ends in a draw, so you can figure out how much the casino profits on average.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing two integers, $2\\leq n\\leq 50$, the number of players, $1\\leq k\\leq 50$, the number of lives each player has, and a real number $0.1 \\leq p \\leq 0.9$, with at most two digits after the decimal point, which is the probability the coin lands heads.\n\n-----Output-----\n - Output a single real number: the probability of the game ending in a draw. Your answer should have an absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 2 0.5\nSample Output 1:\n0.185185185\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 2 0.8\nSample Output 2:\n0.056241426\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
