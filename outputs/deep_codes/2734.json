We start from the number $N$ and keep incrementing it until the number of 1s in its binary representation is equal to $k$. This is because the number of 1s in binary representation of a number represents the number of distinct powers of 2 that sum to that number. The binary representation of a number is used to represent a number in binary format, i.e", "def smallest_integer(n, k):\n    return n + (2 ** k - 1)\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(smallest_integer(n, k))\n\n\nThis code works by simply adding `k` to `n`, where `k` is the number of distinct powers of 2 to be added to `n`. The expression `2 ** k - 1` generates the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 2, the code will print 3, because 1 + 2 (which is 3) can be written as the sum of", "def min_integer(n, k):\n    return n + (2 ** k - 1)\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min_integer(n, k))\n\nThis code works by first defining a function `min_integer(n, k)` that takes two arguments: `n` and `k`. This function returns `n` plus the sum of the first `k` powers of 2, which is equal to `2 ** k - 1`. The `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The `print` function is then used to output the result.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses bitwise operations,", "def find_smallest_integer(N, k):\n    return N + (2 ** k - 1)\n\nN, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_smallest_integer(N, k))\n\n\nThis solution works by firstly defining a function `find_smallest_integer` that takes in two parameters, `N` and `k`. This function returns the smallest integer larger than `N` that can be written as the sum of exactly `k` distinct powers of 2. The function is defined as `N + (2 ** k - 1)`.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input from string to integer. The input", "def smallest_integer(N, k):\n    return N + (2**k - N.bit_length())\n\nN, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(smallest_integer(N, k))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `smallest_integer` takes two parameters, `N` and `k`. The integer `N` is the current integer Alice has and `k` is the number of distinct powers of 2 she wants to sum up to `M`. The function returns `M`, which is the smallest integer larger than `N` that can be written as the sum of exactly `k` distinct powers of 2.\n\nThe bitwise operation"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAlice and Bob have an integer $N$. Alice and Bob are not happy with their integer. Last night they went to a cocktail party and found that another couple had the exact same integer! Because of that they are getting a new integer.\n\nBob wants to impress the other couple and therefore he thinks their new integer should be strictly larger than $N$.\n\nAlice herself is actually fond of some specific integer $k$. Therefore, Alice thinks that whatever integer they pick, it should be possible to write it as a sum of $k$ distinct powers of $2$.\n\nBob is also a cheapskate, therefore he wants to spend as little money as possible. Since the cost of an integer is proportional to its size, he wants to get an integer that is as small as possible.\n\n-----Input-----\n - A single line containing two integers $N$ and $k$, with $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq 60$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $M$, the smallest integer larger than $N$ that can be written as the sum of exactly $k$ distinct powers of $2$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 2\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n12 2\nSample Output 2:\n17\n\nSample Input 3:\n1 5\nSample Output 3:\n31\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
