In Dominion, you can buy a variety of treasure, action, and victory point cards \u2013 at the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins!\n\nEach turn, each player draws $5$ cards and can use their action and treasure cards to obtain buying power in order to buy more cards. Since Jake is just starting out, he\u2019s decided to buy only treasure and victory point cards.\n\nThere are $3$ kinds of victory cards in Dominion:\n - Province (costs $8$, worth $6$ victory points)\n - Duchy (costs $5$, worth $3$ victory points)\n - Estate (costs $2$, worth $1$ victory point)\n\nAnd, there are $3$ kinds of treasure cards:\n - Gold (costs $6$, worth $3$ buying power)\n - Silver (costs $3$, worth $2$ buying power)\n - Copper (costs $0$, worth $1$ buying power)\n\nAt the start of Jake\u2019s turn, he draws $5$ of these cards.
