Since the lengths of the skewers are sorted in increasing order, the shortest skewers will be at the beginning of the list. Then, it sums up every second element in the list, which are the shortest skewers. This is because every two skewers are used to make a serving, and the length", "N = int(input())\nL = list(map(int, input().split()))\nL.sort()\nprint(sum(L[:2*N:2]))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to find the maximum total number of ingredients that can be made by using two skewers from the given list. The shortest skewer can hold the maximum number of ingredients. So, we sort the list in ascending order and then add up the length of every second skewer (which are the shortest) to get the total number of ingredients."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke is having a barbeque party.\nAt the party, he will make N servings of Skewer Meal.\nExample of a serving of Skewer Meal\nHe has a stock of 2N skewers, all of which will be used in Skewer Meal. The length of the i-th skewer is L_i.\nAlso, he has an infinite supply of ingredients.\nTo make a serving of Skewer Meal, he picks 2 skewers and threads ingredients onto those skewers.\nLet the length of the shorter skewer be x, then the serving can hold the maximum of x ingredients.\nWhat is the maximum total number of ingredients that his N servings of Skewer Meal can hold, if he uses the skewers optimally?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266N\u2266100\n - 1\u2266L_i\u2266100\n - For each i, L_i is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nL_1 L_2 ...
