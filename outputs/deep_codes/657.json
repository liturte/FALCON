Since it's already 2018, the advances in alchemy allow easy and efficient ball creation by utilizing magic crystals.\n\nGrisha needs to obtain some yellow, green and blue balls. It's known that to produce a yellow ball one needs two yellow crystals, green\u00a0\u2014 one yellow and one blue, and for a blue ball, three blue crystals are enough.\n\nRight now there are A yellow and B blue crystals in Grisha's disposal. Find out how many additional crystals he should acquire in order to produce the required number of balls.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line features two integers A and B (0 \u2264 A, B \u2264 10^9), denoting the number of yellow and blue crystals respectively at Grisha's disposal.\n\nThe next line contains three integers x, y and z (0 \u2264 x, y, z \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the respective amounts of yellow, green and blue balls to be obtained.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of crystals that Grisha should acquire in addition.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n2 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 9\n1 1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n12345678 87654321\n43043751 1000000000 53798715\n\nOutput\n2147483648\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, Grisha needs five yellow and four blue crystals to create two yellow balls, one green ball, and one blue ball. To do that, Grisha needs to obtain two additional crystals: one yellow and one blue.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
