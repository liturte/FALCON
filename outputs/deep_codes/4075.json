The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.\nBulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are \"on\" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.\nHow many combinations of \"on\" and \"off\" states of the switches light all the bulbs?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N, M \\leq 10\n - 1 \\leq k_i \\leq N\n - 1 \\leq s_{ij} \\leq N\n - s_{ia} \\neq s_{ib} (a \\neq b)\n - p_i is 0 or 1.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nk_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}\n:\nk_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}\np_1 p_2 ... p_M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of combinations of \"on\" and \"off\" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n2 1 2\n1 2\n0 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\n - Bulb 1 is lighted when there is an even number of switches that are \"on\" among the following: Switch 1 and 2.\n - Bulb 2 is lighted when there is an odd number of switches that are \"on\" among the following: Switch 2.\nThere are four possible combinations of states of (Switch 1, Switch 2): (on, on), (on, off), (off, on) and (off, off). Among them, only (on, on) lights all the bulbs, so we should print 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
