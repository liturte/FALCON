Because of this, sometimes when two integers are divided by the same divisor they become equal even though they were originally not equal. For example in C++, $\\verb|5/4|$ and $\\verb|7/4|$ are both equal to 1, but $5 \\neq 7$.\n\nGiven a list of nonnegative integers and a divisor, how many pairs of distinct entries in the list are there that give the same result when both are divided by the divisor in C++?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 200000$), the number of elements in the list, and $d$ ($1 \\leq d \\leq 10^9$), the divisor.\n\nThe second line of input contains $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots , a_ n$ ($0 \\leq a_ i \\leq 10^9$), where $a_ i$ is the $i^\\textrm {th}$ element of the list.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay a single integer indicating the number of distinct pairs of indices $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$ such that $a_ i / d = a_ j / d$ when using integer division in C++. Note that the numbers in the list are not necessarily distinct (i.e. it is possible that $a_ i = a_ j$ for some indices $i \\neq j$).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 4\n4 5 6 7 8\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 1\n4 5 6 7 8\nSample Output 2:\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
