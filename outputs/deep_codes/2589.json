Given an array $a$, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elements isn't divisible by $x$, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist.\n\nAn array $a$ is a subarray of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ $(1 \\le t \\le 5)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains 2 integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le x \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array $a$ and the number that Ehab hates.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$, $a_{n}$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array $a$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each testcase, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by $x$. If there's no such subarray, print $-1$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 3\n1 2 3\n3 4\n1 2 3\n2 2\n0 6\n\nOutput\n2\n3\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the subarray $[2,3]$ has sum of elements $5$, which isn't divisible by $3$.\n\nIn the second test case, the sum of elements of the whole array is $6$, which isn't divisible by $4$.\n\nIn the third test case, all subarrays have an even sum, so the answer is $-1$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
