The string `s` is created by concatenating 10^10 copies of the string '110'. The `count` method of a string returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.\n\nThe input is read from the standard input in the format specified in the problem statement. The length of the string `n` and the string `t` are read from the input.

For large input sizes, you would need to use a more efficient string matching algorithm such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the input is valid and does not handle any potential errors or exceptions.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the string T is a substring of S, as the problem does not specify what to do if T is not a substring of S.
