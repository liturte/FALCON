Then, it returns the maximum count from the frequencies.\n\nThis solution assumes that the optimal choice of X is the most frequent number in the sequence. If there are multiple numbers with the same maximum count, this solution will arbitrarily choose one of them.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the sequence of length N twice, once to count the frequencies and once to find the maximum count. It has a space complexity of O(N) because it uses a dictionary to store the frequencies of the numbers.", "from collections import Counter\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncounter = Counter(A)\n\nX = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\nprint(counter[X])\n\nThis code first counts the occurrences of each number in the list using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. Then it finds the most common number in the list by calling the `most_common(1)` method of the `Counter` object. This method returns a list of tuples, where the first element is the number and the second element is its count. The code then prints the count of the most common number.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N) because it goes through the list of numbers once to count their occurrences and once more to find the most common number. The space complexity is also O(N) because it uses a dictionary to", "from collections import Counter\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncounter = Counter(A)\n\nprint(max(counter.values()))\n\nThis solution uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each element in the list A.
