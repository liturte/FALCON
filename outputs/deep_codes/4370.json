If they are both even or both odd, they can both take their desired number of pieces of cake, so print 'Yay!' otherwise print ':('.\n\nIn Python, the modulus operator '%' can be used to get the remainder of division. If a number is even, it has no remainder when divided by 2 (i.e., A % 2 == 0), while if a number is odd, it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 (i.e., A % 2 == 1).\n\nSo the condition for the if statement is A % 2 != B % 2, which is True if A and B are of different parity (one is even and the other is odd", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A+B < 16:\n    print(\"Yay\")\nelse:\n    print(\":(\")\n\n\nThis code reads two integers A and B from the input, and checks if their sum is less than 16. If it is, it prints \"Yay\", otherwise it prints \":(\". This is because the total number of pieces of cake is 16, and each person can take at most 1 piece of cake if they take two adjacent pieces. Therefore, if A+B is greater than or equal to 16, it is not possible for both E869120 and square1001 to take the desired number of pieces.", "def solve(a, b):\n    if a + b > 16 or a * b > 80:\n        return \":(\"\n    else:\n        return \"Yay!\"\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(a, b))\n\n\nThis python code takes input `a` and `b` as the number of pieces E869120 and square1001 want to take respectively. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than 16 or the product of `a` and `b` is greater than 80. If either of these conditions is true, it returns \":(\". Otherwise, it returns \"Yay!\" indicating that both of them can take the desired number of pieces of cake.\n\nThe function `solve(a, b)` is called with `a` and `b` as the inputs taken from the user. The result is then printed.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B < 16:\n    print('Yay')\nelse:\n    print(':(')\n\n\nThis program reads two integers A and B from the input, adds them together, and checks if the sum is less than 16. If the sum is less than 16, it prints \"Yay!\". Otherwise, it prints \":(\". This is because the maximum number of pieces that can be taken is 16, and if A and B are added together to exceed this, it would mean that the same person is taking two adjacent pieces of cake, which is against the rules.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yay!\" if A + B <= 16 else \":(\")\n\n\nThis program reads two integers A and B from the input, and checks if their sum is less than or equal to 16. If the sum is less than or equal to 16, it prints \"Yay!\". Otherwise, it prints \":(\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the note says that the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake. This means that if A is 5 and B is 4, for example, E869120 and square1001 cannot both take the 5th and 6th pieces of cake, because they are adjacent.\n\nThe code works by splitting the input into two variables A and B, then checking if their sum is less than or equal to 16. If it is, it prints \"Yay!\". If not, it prints \":(\".\n\nThis is a"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nE869120's and square1001's 16-th birthday is coming soon.\n\nTakahashi from AtCoder Kingdom gave them a round cake cut into 16 equal fan-shaped pieces.\nE869120 and square1001 were just about to eat A and B of those pieces, respectively,\n\nwhen they found a note attached to the cake saying that \"the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake\".\nCan both of them obey the instruction in the note and take desired numbers of pieces of cake?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - A and B are integers between 1 and 16 (inclusive).\n - A+B is at most 16.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B\n\n-----Output-----\nIf both E869120 and square1001 can obey the instruction in the note and take desired numbers of pieces of cake, print Yay!; otherwise, print :(.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYay!\n\nBoth of them can take desired number of pieces as follows:\n\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
