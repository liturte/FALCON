The first part is getting the input and splitting the string into words.\n\n2. The second part is a list comprehension that for each word in words calculates the sum of boolean values where each boolean value is True if the character is uppercase (c.isupper() returns True) and False otherwise. This sum is the volume of the word.\n\n3. The third part is calculating the maximum volume of all words.\n\nThe result is printed out.\n\n\n-----Time complexity-----\n\nThe time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the text. This is because we are going through the string once to split it into words and then we are going through each word once to calculate its volume.\n\n\n-----Space complexity-----\n\nThe", "def max_volume(text):\n    words = text.split(\" \")\n    return max([sum([1 for c in word if c.isupper()]) for word in words])\n\nn = int(input())\ntext = input()\nprint(max_volume(text))\n\n\nThis solution works by first splitting the input text into words. Then it calculates the volume of each word (the number of uppercase letters in the word) and returns the maximum volume.\n\nIt's assumed that the input text is valid and does not contain any special characters or numbers. If that's not the case, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nAlso, the solution assumes that the words in the text are separated by a single space. If the words can be separated by multiple spaces or other characters, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe solution is written in Python. If you want it in a different programming language, you would need to rewrite it.\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the text"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters.\n\nVolume of the word is number of capital letters in the word.
