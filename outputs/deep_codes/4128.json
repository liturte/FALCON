You want to distribute these $n$ candies between two sisters in such a way that:  Alice will get $a$ ($a > 0$) candies;  Betty will get $b$ ($b > 0$) candies;  each sister will get some integer number of candies;  Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. $a > b$);  all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. $a+b=n$). \n\nYour task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly $n$ candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.\n\nFormally, find the number of ways to represent $n$ as the sum of $n=a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a>b$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$) \u2014 the number of candies you have.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the number of ways to distribute exactly $n$ candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print $0$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\n1\n2\n3\n2000000000\n763243547\n\nOutput\n3\n0\n0\n1\n999999999\n381621773\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the test case of the example, the $3$ possible ways to distribute candies are:  $a=6$, $b=1$;  $a=5$, $b=2$;  $a=4$, $b=3$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
