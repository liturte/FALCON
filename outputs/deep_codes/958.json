He likes nice strings \u2014 strings of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters only.\n\nThe distance between two letters is defined as the difference between their positions in the alphabet. For example, $\\operatorname{dist}(c, e) = \\operatorname{dist}(e, c) = 2$, and $\\operatorname{dist}(a, z) = \\operatorname{dist}(z, a) = 25$.\n\nAlso, the distance between two nice strings is defined as the sum of distances of corresponding letters. For example, $\\operatorname{dist}(a f, d b) = \\operatorname{dist}(a, d) + \\operatorname{dist}(f, b) = 3 + 4 = 7$, and $\\text{dist(bear, roar)} = 16 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 26$.\n\nLimak gives you a nice string s and an integer k. He challenges you to find any nice string s' that $\\operatorname{dist}(s, s^{\\prime}) = k$. Find any s' satisfying the given conditions, or print \"-1\" if it's impossible to do so.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6).\n\nThe second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no string satisfying the given conditions then print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print any nice string s' that $\\operatorname{dist}(s, s^{\\prime}) = k$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 26\nbear\n\nOutput\nroar\nInput\n2 7\naf\n\nOutput\ndb\n\nInput\n3 1000\nhey\n\nOutput\n-1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
