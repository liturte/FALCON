The probability that SmallR will win the match is the probability that SmallR will shoot first. This is equal to `a / (a + c)`.\n\nThe code takes four integers as input, calculates the probability that SmallR will win the match and prints it.\n\nThis solution assumes that the inputs are valid, i.e., `a` and `c` are positive, `b` and `d` are greater than 0, and `a / b < 1` and `c / d < 1`.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the game is fair and that the probability of SmallR shooting is independent of the probability of Zanoes shooting.\n\nThis solution assumes that the probability of SmallR and Zanoes shooting is calculated independently. If", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a / (a + c))\n\n\nThis code works by taking the inputs and storing them in the variables a, b, c, and d. It then calculates the probability that SmallR will win the match by dividing the probability of SmallR shooting the target by the sum of the probabilities of SmallR and Zanoes shooting the target. The result is printed out.", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a / (a + c))\n\n\nExplanation:\nIn this problem, we are asked to find the probability that SmallR will win the match. The probability of SmallR shooting the target is a/b and the probability of Zanoes shooting the target is c/d. Since the one who shoots the target first should be the winner, the probability that SmallR will win is a/(a+c), where a and c are the numerators of the probabilities of SmallR and Zanoes respectively.\n\nWe use the built-in map function to read the input, which splits the input into four integers a, b, c, and d. Then we print the probability that SmallR will win.", "a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\nprint(a / (a + c))\n\n\nThis solution works by using the fact that the probability of SmallR shooting first is the same as the probability of SmallR not losing. This is equivalent to the equation a / (a + c), which is the probability of SmallR shooting first.\n\nThe reason for this is that the probability of SmallR not losing is 1 - the probability of Zanoes shooting first. The probability of Zanoes shooting first is c / (a + c), and so the probability of SmallR not losing is 1 - c / (a + c) = (a + c) / (a + c) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of SmallR winning is the probability of SmallR not losing, which is a / (a + c).\n\nThis solution assumes that the inputs are always valid, as per the problem statement.\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `map` function to read the four input integers,"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSmallR is an archer.
