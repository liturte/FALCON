One of their more obvious distinctions lies in the design of their coinage. Believing that a person should be easily able to identify the value a coin in a pocket or change purse by touch alone, Erratica designs its coins as polygons. For stability, the coins are convex \u2013 there are no notches cut into the coins. But the overall shapes themselves can be quite irregular.\n\nErratica Vending, the only manufacturer of vending machines in the nation, has been sent the design for a new coin to be issued. Their machines are designed so that coins enter through a slot into channel shaped as a rectangular prism with the slot being an open face of the prism. The channel is narrow because the coins are thin, but long enough to contain the entire coin. From the outside of the machine, the slot appears as a rectangular hole.\n\nThe company wants to know what would be the smallest slot size they will need so that the new coin can be slipped, after some rotation, into the slot.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput begins with a line containing $N$, the number of sides to the polygonal coin, where $3 \\leq N \\leq 20$.\n\nThis is followed by $N$ lines, each containing two real numbers $x$ and $y$, the coordinates of a vertex of the polygon, where $0 \\leq x, y \\leq 100$. All real numbers have at most $2$ digits after the decimal point.\n\nAll $N$ vertices will be distinct, and the vertices will be presented in an order proceeding clockwise around the perimeter of the coin.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line with a real number denoting the minimum slot size allowing the coin to pass through. Outputs will be accepted that are within $\\pm 0.01$ of the judges\u2019 answer.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n0 0\n0.71 3.54\n4.21 4.21\nSample Output:\n2.00111219\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
