Limak solves them as follows:\n\n  Limak spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem and he gets 50 - c\u00b710 = 50 - 2\u00b710 = 30 points.  Limak spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 10 + 15 = 25 minutes after the start of the contest. For the 2-nd problem he gets 85 - 2\u00b725 = 35 points.  He spends 25 minutes on the 3-rd problem so he submits it 10 + 15 + 25 = 50 minutes after the start. For this problem he gets 250 - 2\u00b750 = 150 points. \n\nSo, Limak got 30 + 35 + 150 = 215 points.\n\nRadewoosh solves problem in the reversed order:\n\n  Radewoosh solves 3-rd problem after 25 minutes so he gets 250 - 2\u00b725 = 200 points.  He spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 25 + 15 = 40 minutes after the start. He gets 85 - 2\u00b740 = 5 points for this problem.  He spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem so he submits it 25 + 15 + 10 = 50 minutes after the start. He gets max(0, 50 - 2\u00b750) = max(0,  - 50) = 0 points. \n\nRadewoosh got 200 + 5 + 0 = 205 points in total. Limak has 215 points so Limak wins.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak will get 0 points for each problem and Radewoosh will first solve the hardest problem and he will get 250 - 6\u00b725 = 100 points for that. Radewoosh will get 0 points for other two problems but he is the winner anyway.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak will get 2 points for the 1-st problem and 2 points for the 2-nd problem. Radewoosh will get 4 points for the 8-th problem. They won't get points for other problems and thus there is a tie because 2 + 2 = 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
