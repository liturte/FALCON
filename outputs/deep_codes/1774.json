The `% 2 == 0` part checks if the count is even. If it is, the program prints \"Yes\". If it's not, the program prints \"No\".\n\nThis program assumes that the input will only contain the characters \"H\" and \"Q\". If the input could contain other characters, the program would need to be modified accordingly.\n\nThis program also assumes that the input will be a string between 1 and 10^6 characters long, as specified in the problem statement. If the input could be longer or shorter, the program would need to be modified accordingly.\n\nFinally, this program is written in Python, but it could be written in any programming language that supports the same syntax and standard library.", "def hq9_plus(s):\n    return \"Yes\" if \"HQ\" in s else \"No\"\n\ns = input()\nprint(hq9_plus(s))\n\n\nThis code takes a string input, checks if it contains the substring \"HQ\" and returns \"Yes\" if it does, \"No\" if it doesn't.\n\nThis code uses Python's in-built string method `in` to check if \"HQ\" is present in the input string. It then prints the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string is case sensitive, meaning \"HQ\" and \"hq\" are considered different substrings. If you want to ignore case, you can modify the function to convert the input string to either lower or upper case before checking if \"HQ\" is present.\n\nFor example:\n\n\ndef hq9_plus(s):\n    return \"Yes\" if \"hq\" in s.lower() else \"No\"\n\n\nThis will return \"Yes\" for both \"hq\" and \"HQ\".\n\nNote: This code does not handle any errors or edge cases. You may want to add error checking or handle other edge cases depending on your specific requirements.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the input string is a valid Python string. If the input string might contain invalid characters or be a different type of object, you should", "print(\"Yes\" if input().count('Q') <= 2 else \"No\")\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis solution works by reading the input and counting the number of 'Q' characters. If the number of 'Q' characters is less than or equal to 2, the program prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\". The condition in the if statement checks if the number of 'Q' characters is less than or equal to 2, which is equivalent to checking if the input contains at most 2 'Q' characters.\n\nThe function `input().count('Q')` reads the input and counts the number of 'Q' characters in it. The expression `input().count('Q') <= 2` checks if the count is less than or equal to 2. The `print` function then prints \"Yes\" if the count is less than or equal to 2, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe `input().count('Q')` function is equivalent to the following:\n\n\ninput_string = input()\ncount = input_string.count('Q')\n\n\nIn this code, `input_string = input()` reads the input and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. The expression `input_string.count('Q')` counts the number of 'Q' characters in `input_string` and assigns the result to the variable `count`. The condition `", "s = input()\nif 'H' in s and 'Q' in s and s.count('H') == s.count('Q') == max(s.count(i) for i in 'HD'):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code will check if the string contains 'H' and 'Q' and if the number of 'H' and 'Q' are equal. If both conditions are met, it will print \"Yes\", otherwise it will print \"No\".\n\nThis problem is a simple string manipulation problem. The key is to understand the constraints of the problem (1 <= len(s) <= 10^6) and how to handle such large inputs efficiently. In this case, we don't need to check every character in the string, we only need to check if 'H' and 'Q' exist in the string and if the number of 'H' and 'Q' are equal. This is done using the count() function in Python.\n\nThe condition `s.count(i) for i in 'HD'` is used to find the maximum number of 'H' and 'Q' in the string. This is done because we need the maximum count of 'H' and 'Q' to be equal for the string to be valid.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because", "def HQ9_plus():\n    s = input()\n    if s.count('H') >= 2 and s.count('Q') >= 1 and s.count('9') >= 1:\n        print('Yes')\n    else:\n        print('No')\n\nHQ9_plus()\n\n\nThis python code reads a string from the input, counts the occurrences of 'H', 'Q', and '9' in it, and checks if there are at least 2 'H', 1 'Q', and 1 '9' in the string. If all conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.\n\nNOTE: This code assumes that the input is a string of uppercase letters. If the input can be in lowercase letters, we should convert the input to uppercase before counting the occurrences of 'H', 'Q', and '9'.\n\n\ndef HQ9_plus():\n    s = input().upper()\n    if s.count('H') >= 2 and s.count('Q') >= 1 and s.count('9') >= 1:\n        print('Yes')\n    else:\n        print('No')\n\nHQ9_plus()\n\n\nThis modified code will work for inputs in either lowercase or uppercase.\n\nNOTE: The original problem statement was lost in a raccoon attack.\n\n\nNOTE"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe famous joke programming language HQ9+ has only 4 commands.
