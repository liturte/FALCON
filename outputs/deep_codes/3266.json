Nodes are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. Then follow $m$ lines, each line consisting of three (space-separated) integers $u$, $v$ and $c$ indicating that there is an edge from $u$ to $v$ in the graph with capacity $1 \\le c \\le 10^{8}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should begin with a line containing three integers $n$, $f$, and $m\u2019$. $n$ is the number of nodes in the flow graph (same as in input), $f$ is the size of a maximum flow from node $s$ to node $t$ in the flow graph, and $m\u2019$ is the number of edges used in the solution. You may assume that $f < 2^{31}$.\n\nThen there should be $m\u2019$ lines, each containing three integers $u$, $v$ and $x$, indicating that $x$ units of flow are transported from $u$ to $v$. $x$ must be greater than $0$ and at most as big as the capacity from $u$ to $v$. Each pair of vertices $(u, v)$ should be given at most once in the output.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 5 0 3\n0 1 10\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n0 2 1\n2 3 10\nSample Output 1:\n4 3 5\n0 1 2\n0 2 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n2 3 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 1 0 1\n0 1 100000\nSample Output 2:\n2 100000 1\n0 1 100000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
