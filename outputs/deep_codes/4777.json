The formula is derived from the observation that the number of A's increases by the number of B's and vice versa. The base case is when K=0, there are 0 A's and 1 B's. For K=1, there are 0 A's and 1 B's. For K=2, there are 1 A's and 1 B's. For K=3, there are 1 A", "def count_letters(K):\n    a = [0] * K\n    b = [0] * K\n    a[0] = 1\n    b[0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, K):\n        a[i] = b[i-1]\n        b[i] = a[i-1] + b[i-1]\n    return a[K-1], b[K-1]\n\nK = int(input())\nprint(*count_letters(K))\n\nThis Python code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates two lists, `a` and `b`, to keep track of the number of letters A and B respectively. The number of letters A after `K` presses of the button is the number of letters B after `K-1` presses, and the number of letters B after `K` presses of the button is", "def count_letters(k):\n    a, b = 1, 0\n    for _ in range(k):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a, b\n\nk = int(input())\na, b = count_letters(k)\nprint(a, b)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `count_letters` calculates the number of As and Bs after `k` button presses. It uses a simple dynamic programming approach. The base case is `a=1` and `b=0`, which correspond to the initial state of the machine. For each button press, the number of As and Bs is updated by adding the number of As and Bs of the previous state. The result is then printed.\n\nThe input is read as a single integer and passed to the `count_letters` function. The result is printed as two space-separ", "def find_letters(K):\n    a, b = 1, 0\n    for _ in range(K):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a, b\n\nK = int(input())\na, b = find_letters(K)\nprint(a, b)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn this problem, we are essentially calculating the Fibonacci sequence, but with the letters A and B instead of numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. In this case, the letters A and B are the two preceding ones.\n\nThe function `find_letters(K)` calculates the number of letters A and B after `K` button presses. The base cases are `a=1` and `b=0`, which correspond to the initial state of the screen (", "def count_letters(k):\n    a, b = 1, 0\n    for _ in range(k):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a, b\n\nk = int(input())\na, b = count_letters(k)\nprint(a, b)\n\n\nThis solution uses a simple recursive approach to solve the problem. The function `count_letters(k)` calculates the number of 'A's and 'B's after `k` button presses. It uses a loop to calculate the number of 'A's and 'B's for each button press. The number of 'A's is calculated as the number of 'B's from the previous button press, and the number of 'B's is calculated as the sum of 'A's and 'B's from the previous button press. The function returns a tuple of the number"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nOne day, little Mirko came across a funny looking machine! It consisted of a very very large screen and a single button. When he found the machine, the screen displayed only the letter A. After he pressed the button, the letter changed to B. The next few times he pressed the button, the word transformed from B to BA, then to BAB, then to BABBA... When he saw this, Mirko realized that the machine alters the word in a way that all the letters B get transformed to BA and all the letters A get transformed to B.\n\nAmused by the machine, Mirko asked you a very difficult question! After $K$ times of pressing the button, how many letters A and how much letters B will be displayed on the screen?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq 45$), the number of times Mirko pressed the button.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain two space-separated integers, the number of letters A and the number of letter B.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1\nSample Output 1:\n0 1\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\nSample Output 2:\n2 3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
