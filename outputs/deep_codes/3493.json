Astronauts, War Heroes, Olympians \u2014 you\u2019re here because we want the best, and you are it. That said, it\u2019s time to make some science.\n\nNow, I want each of you to stand on one of these buttons. Well done, we\u2019re making great progress here. Now let\u2019s do it again. Oh, come on - don\u2019t stand on the same button! Move, people! No, no, that button\u2019s only for the Astronauts, you know who you are. What?! You say you can\u2019t do everything I ask? Ok let\u2019s start over. You there, the Programmer, figure out how many times we can do this. And make it quick, we have a lot more science to get through\u2026\n\n-----Input-----\nThere will be a single test case in the input. The first line of this case will contain $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 80$) giving the number of people (and the number of buttons) in the experiment. The next $n$ lines will contain $n$ characters each. If the $j^{th}$ character of the $i^{th}$ line is Y it indicates that the $i^{th}$ person can stand on the $j^{th}$ button (it is N otherwise).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $k$, the maximum number of times everyone can be standing on buttons such that nobody stands on the same button more than once (This might be $0$). After that, output $k$ lines. Each line should contain $n$ integers separated by single spaces, where the $i^{th}$ integer describes which person is standing on the $i^{th}$ button. All of the lines should be valid and none of them should put the same person on the same button as a previous line of the same test case. Note that correct outputs might not be unique.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\nYYY\nNYY\nYNY\nSample Output:\n2\n1 2 3\n3 1 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
