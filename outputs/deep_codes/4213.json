{"4213": {"code": ["N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(A, A[1:])))\n\n\nThis program first reads an integer N and a list of integers from standard input. It then computes the maximum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, and prints this value. The zip function is used to pair up the elements of the list with their successors, and the abs and max functions are used to compute the absolute difference and find the maximum.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is correct, i.e., that the first line is an integer and the second line is a list of integers. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be necessary.\n\nAlso, please note that this solution uses a generator expression, which is a more memory-efficient way to compute the maximum absolute difference than creating a list of all possible differences first.\n\nThis solution is written in Python 3.\n\"\"\"", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(A, A[1:])))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code reads the input, converts it into a list of integers, and then computes the maximum absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers in the list. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the iterable produced by the expression in the parentheses. The `zip` function is used to pair up consecutive elements of the list, and the `abs` function is used to compute the absolute value of the difference.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is well-formed and does not include any error checking. If the input might be malformed, you would need to add appropriate error checking code.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list could be empty, you would need to add appropriate error checking code to handle this case.\n\nThis code has a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates over the list once to compute the differences, and then iterates over the differences once to find the maximum.\n\nThis code has a space complexity of O(N) because it creates a list of differences.\n\nThis code works for inputs where the maximum absolute difference is between two different elements of the list. If the maximum absolute difference could be zero, you", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_diff = 0\nmin_val = A[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, N):\n    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(A[i] - min_val))\n    min_val = min(min_val, A[i])\n\nprint(max_diff)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis Python program solves the problem by iterating through the array once. In each iteration, it updates the maximum difference found so far and the minimum value seen so far. The maximum difference is then the maximum of the current maximum difference and the absolute difference between the current value and the minimum value seen so far.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), as it requires a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is valid and does not include error checking or handling for invalid input.\n\nIt also assumes that the input is given in the format specified in the problem statement.\n\nFinally, it assumes that the problem statement is correct and the problem is correctly stated.\n\nPlease note that this code is a pure Python solution and does not take into account any potential issues or constraints that may arise in a real-world scenario.\n\nThe code is written in a way", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(max(abs(a-b) for a in A for b in A if a != b))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a Python program that reads an integer N from the standard input, reads N integers into a list A, and then calculates the maximum absolute difference of two elements in A. It does this by generating all possible pairs of elements in A, calculates the absolute difference of each pair, and then finds the maximum of these differences. The pair is selected if the elements in the pair are not the same (a != b).\n\nThe solution uses Python's built-in functions max and abs to find the maximum and absolute value respectively. The expression abs(a-b) for a in A for b in A if a != b generates all possible pairs of elements in A, calculates the absolute difference of each pair, and then finds the maximum of these differences. The expression a != b ensures that the same element is not paired with itself.\n\nThe result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution works because the maximum absolute difference of two elements in a list is at most the maximum element minus the minimum element. The minimum element is the first element in the sorted list, and the maximum element is the last element in the sorted list. So, the maximum absolute difference is the difference between the last and first", "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprint(max(abs(a - b) for a in A for b in A if a != b))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis Python code reads the number of elements N and the list of integers A from the standard input. It then computes and prints the maximum absolute difference of two different elements in A by iterating over all pairs of elements (a, b) in A and taking the maximum of the absolute differences.
