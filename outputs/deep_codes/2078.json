All segments are either horizontal or vertical and intersect with at least one side of the square.\n\nNow you are wondering how many pieces this square divides into after drawing all segments. Write a program calculating the number of pieces of the square.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($0 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of horizontal segments and the number of vertical segments.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain descriptions of the horizontal segments. The $i$-th line contains three integers $y_i$, $lx_i$ and $rx_i$ ($0 < y_i < 10^6$; $0 \\le lx_i < rx_i \\le 10^6$), which means the segment connects $(lx_i, y_i)$ and $(rx_i, y_i)$.\n\nThe next $m$ lines contain descriptions of the vertical segments. The $i$-th line contains three integers $x_i$, $ly_i$ and $ry_i$ ($0 < x_i < 10^6$; $0 \\le ly_i < ry_i \\le 10^6$), which means the segment connects $(x_i, ly_i)$ and $(x_i, ry_i)$.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there are no two segments on the same line, and each segment intersects with at least one of square's sides.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of pieces the square is divided into after drawing all the segments.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3 3\n2 3 1000000\n4 0 4\n3 0 1000000\n4 0 1\n2 0 5\n3 1 1000000\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\n The sample is like this: [Image]\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
