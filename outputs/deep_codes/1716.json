Find the answer for each of these Q queries to help him.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).\n - M is an integer between 1 and 200 \\ 000 (inclusive).\n - Q is an integer between 1 and 100 \\ 000 (inclusive).\n - 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N (1 \\leq i \\leq M)\n - 1 \\leq p_i \\leq q_i \\leq N (1 \\leq i \\leq Q)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M Q\nL_1 R_1\nL_2 R_2\n:\nL_M R_M\np_1 q_1\np_2 q_2\n:\np_Q q_Q\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint Q lines. The i-th line should contain the number of the trains that runs strictly within the section from City p_i to City q_i.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 3 1\n1 1\n1 2\n2 2\n1 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nAs all the trains runs within the section from City 1 to City 2, the answer to the only query is 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
