{"4505": {"code": ["S = input()\nprint('Yes' if S == ''.join(sorted(S)) else 'No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nHere, we are just sorting the string S and comparing it to the original string. If the sorted string is equal to the original, it means that the characters in the string can be rearranged to form the string \"abc\". This is because the sorted function sorts the characters in the string in ascending order.\n\nIf the sorted string is not equal to the original, it means that the characters in the string cannot be rearranged to form the string \"abc\".\n\nThis solution is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Testcase 1:\n# Input: bac\n# Output: Yes\n\n# Testcase 2:\n# Input: cab\n# Output: No\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"", "S = input()\nif S == 'abc' or S == 'acb' or S == 'bac' or S == 'bca' or S == 'cab' or S == 'cba':\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code will read the input string S, and then check if S is equal to any of the 6 permutations of abc. If it is, it will print \"Yes\"; otherwise, it will print \"No\".\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the input will always be a string of exactly 3 characters, as per the problem statement.\n\nAlso, please note that the order of the characters in the permutations matters. If S is \"bac\", it is not the same as \"abc\".\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1), as it always checks 6 conditions regardless of the size of the input string.\n\nThe solution has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input string and the output.\n\nThe solution is correct and efficient for the given problem statement and constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nS = input()\nif S == 'abc' or S == 'acb' or S S == 'bac' or S == 'bca' or S == 'cab' or S == 'cba':\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\n\n\nS = input()\nif S == 'abc':\n    print('Yes')\nelif S == 'ac", "S = input()\nif S == \"abc\" or S[::-1] == \"abc\":\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis Python code first reads the input string S. It then checks if S is equal to \"abc\" or the reverse of S is equal to \"abc\". If either is true, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\".", "s = input()\nif ''.join(sorted(s)) == 'abc':\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem asks to check if a given string can be obtained by permuting the string 'abc'. We can solve this by sorting the characters in the string and comparing it with 'abc'. If they are the same, that means the string can be obtained by permuting 'abc'.\n\nIn the code, we first take a string as input. Then we sort the characters in the string and join them to form a new string. We compare this new string with 'abc'. If they are the same, we print 'Yes'. Otherwise, we print 'No'.\n\nThis solution is in Python.\n\nThis code works by first taking a string as input. Then it sorts the characters in the string and joins them into a new string. It compares this new string with 'abc'. If they are the same, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n\ns = input()\nif ''.join(sorted(s)) == 'abc':\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code works by first taking a string as input.

If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nIt's important to note that Python's string comparison is lexicographic by default, so the permutations 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', and 'cba' will be sorted in ascending order, and the comparison will work correctly."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S of length 3 consisting of a, b and c.
