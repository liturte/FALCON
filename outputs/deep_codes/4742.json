Unlike more traditional methods based on keys and chords, the technique known as dodecaphony focuses on using all twelve notes equally. As a quick reminder, the twelve notes, in ascending order are,\\[ C, C\\sharp , D, D\\sharp , E, F, F\\sharp , G, G\\sharp , A, A\\sharp , B \\]\n\nThe sequence then wraps around so that the next note after $B$ is $C$ and so on. For this problem, we\u2019ll ignore equivalent notations that use flats, double sharps, or double flats.\n\nEach successive note above is considered one semitone away from the next. Now in our simplified version of dodecaphony, a melody is a permutation of the previous melody by one of three relations.\n\nFirst, we have transposition, where each note has been shifted up by $n$ semitones. A retrograde is when the notes have their order reversed. Finally we have inversion about the first note of the melody. With inversions, the first note doesn\u2019t change, but the rest of the notes are inverted such that the the interval (number of semitones) between that note and the first note is negated.\n\nFor example, if $F$ is our first note, and we want to invert an $A\\sharp $, which is $5$ semitones higher, the inverted note would be a $C$, which is $5$ semitones lower.
