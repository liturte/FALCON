The string written on the i-th blue card is s_i, and the string written on the i-th red card is t_i.\nTakahashi will now announce a string, and then check every card. Each time he finds a blue card with the string announced by him, he will earn 1 yen (the currency of Japan); each time he finds a red card with that string, he will lose 1 yen.\nHere, we only consider the case where the string announced by Takahashi and the string on the card are exactly the same. For example, if he announces atcoder, he will not earn money even if there are blue cards with atcoderr, atcode, btcoder, and so on. (On the other hand, he will not lose money even if there are red cards with such strings, either.)\nAt most how much can he earn on balance?\nNote that the same string may be written on multiple cards.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - N and M are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N, M \\leq 100\n - s_1, s_2, ..., s_N, t_1, t_2, ..., t_M are all strings of lengths between 1 and 10 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\ns_1\ns_2\n:\ns_N\nM\nt_1\nt_2\n:\nt_M\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Takahashi can earn at most X yen on balance, print X.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\napple\norange\napple\n1\ngrape\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nHe can earn 2 yen by announcing apple.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
