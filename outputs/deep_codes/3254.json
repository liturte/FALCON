{"3254": {"code": ["P = float(input())\nprint(0, 0, 0, int(P), int(5 - P))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem can be solved by simply using the values of the numbers from 1 to 5 in the way that the sum equals the given number P. Since there is an unlimited quantity of each type of paper, we don't need to worry about the quantity of each type of paper. We just need to distribute the total sum of numbers among the types of paper. In this case, we can use the minimum possible number of each type of paper to get the closest average to the given number P.\n\nThe number of ones, twos, threes, fours and fives are printed in the order they appear in the problem statement.\n\nThe int() function is used to convert the floating point number to an integer, since we can't have fractions of a paper. The remaining number of papers is calculated by subtracting the sum of the integers from 5.\n\nThis solution assumes that the given number P is always greater than or equal to", "P = float(input())\nnum_ones = num_twos = num_threes = num_fours = num_fives = 0\nwhile P - 5 >= 0:\n    P -= 5\n    num_fives += 1\nwhile P - 4.5 >= 0:\n    P -= 4.5\n    num_fours += 1\nwhile P - 4 >= 0:\n    P -= 4\n    num_fours += 1\nwhile P - 3.5 >= 0:\n    P -= 3.5\n    num_threes += 1\nwhile P - 3 >= 0:\n    P -= 3\n    num_threes += 1\nwhile P - 2.5 >= 0:\n    P -= 2.5\n    num_twos += 1\nwhile P - 2 >= 0:\n    P -= 2\n    num_twos += 1\nwhile P - 1.5 >= 0:\n    P -= 1.5\n    num_ones += 1\nwhile P -", "P = float(input())\nif P == 5.0:\n    print(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)\nelif P == 4.5:\n    print(0, 0, 0, 1, 1)\nelif P == 4.0:\n    print(0, 0, 1, 1, 1)\nelif P == 3.5:\n    print(0, 1, 1, 1, 1)\nelif P == 3.0:\n    print(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")\n\n\nThis Python program takes a float number P as input and prints the number of ones, twos, threes, fours and fives needed to get an average of P. The program checks if P is equal to certain values and prints the corresponding numbers of each number. If P is not one of the checked values, it prints \"Invalid input\".\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the", "def solve(p):\n    p *= 1000000\n    p, r = divmod(p, 1000000)\n    return [p]*5 + [r//2]\n\np = float(input())\nprint(' '.join(map(str, solve(p))))\n\n\nThis Python code takes the input `p`, multiplies it by 1,000,000 to convert it to an integer, and then divides it by 1,000,000 to get the integer part and the remainder. It then returns a list of 5 zeros followed by the remainder divided by 2.\n\nThe reason we multiply by 1,000,000 is to handle the precision issue when dealing with floating point numbers. We're essentially scaling the problem up so that we can deal with integers. This way, we can always divide by 1,000,000 to get back to the original scale.\n\nThe remainder is divided by 2", "P = float(input())\nnums = [0]*5\n\nwhile P < 5:\n    P += 1\n    nums[0] += 1\n\nwhile P > 4.75:\n    P -= 1\n    nums[3] += 1\n\nwhile P > 4.5:\n    P -= 0.75\n    nums[2] += 1\n\nwhile P > 4.25:\n    P -= 0.5\n    nums[1] += 1\n\nwhile P > 4:\n    P -= 0.25\n    nums[4] += 1\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\n\nThis code works by iteratively subtracting the appropriate amount from $P$ and incrementing the corresponding counter in the nums array until $P$ is no longer greater than the desired value. The resulting counts are then printed.\n\nThis code assumes that the numbers are rounded to the nearest 0.25.
