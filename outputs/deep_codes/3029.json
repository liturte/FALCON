The vertex $v_1$ is the root.\n\nDefine a \u201cjumping path\u201d within the tree to be a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ k$ of length $k$ where $v_{a_ i}$ is an ancestor of $v_{a_ j}$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le k$.\n\nCompute two quantities for the given tree:\n - The length $L$ of the longest jumping path where the labels of the vertices are nondecreasing. That is, $u_{a_ i} \\le u_{a_ j}$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le L$.\n - The number $M$ of jumping paths of length $L$ where the labels of the vertices are nondecreasing. Since this number may be large, give the remainder of $M$ when divided by the prime $11092019$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of vertices in the tree ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$).\n\nThis is followed by $N$ lines of input indicating the labels $u_1$ through $u_ N$. Each label is an integer in the range $[0, 10^6]$.\n\nThe remaining $N-1$ lines describe the tree structure. Skipping the root (which has no parent) and starting with $i=2$, line $i$ gives the parent $p_ i < i$ of vertex $v_ i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line of output with two integers separated by a space. The first integer is $L$, and the second integer is $M$ modulo the prime $11092019$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSample Output 1:\n5 1\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSample Output 2:\n1 5\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\n1\n5\n3\n6\n1\n2\n3\nSample Output 3:\n3 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
