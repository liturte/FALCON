The dictionary keys are the numbers, and the values are the counts of these numbers. If a number is announced and its count is even, it is erased from the dictionary, otherwise it is written on the sheet.

The set automatically removes duplicates, so we don't need to check if a number is already written before trying to write it again.

It uses a set to keep track of the unique elements. If an element is already in the set, it removes it, otherwise, it adds it. At the end, it prints the size of the set, which represents the number of unique elements.", "N = int(input())\nnumbers = set()\n\nfor _ in range(N):\n    A = int(input())\n    if A in numbers:\n        numbers.remove(A)\n    else:\n        numbers.add(A)\n\nprint(len(numbers))\n\nIn this code, we use a set to store the numbers that are written on the sheet. If the number is already in the set, we remove it. If the number is not in the set, we add it. At the end of the game, the size of the set will be the number of numbers written on the sheet.\n\nThis", "n = int(input())\nnums = set()\nfor _ in range(n):\n    num = int(input())\n    if num in nums:\n        nums.remove(num)\n    else:\n        nums.add(num)\nprint(len(nums))\n\n\nThis code works by creating an empty set and then iterating over the input numbers. If a number is already in the set, it is removed from the set. If it is not in the set, it is added to the set. At the end of the game, the size of the set is the number of numbers that are written on"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are playing the following game with Joisino.\n - Initially, you have a blank sheet of paper.\n - Joisino announces a number. If that number is written on the sheet, erase the number from the sheet; if not, write the number on the sheet. This process is repeated N times.\n - Then, you are asked a question: How many numbers are written on the sheet now?\nThe numbers announced by Joisino are given as A_1, ... ,A_N in the order she announces them. How many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2264N\u2264100000\n - 1\u2264A_i\u22641000000000(=10^9)\n - All input values are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1\n:\nA_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint how many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n6\n2\n6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nThe game proceeds as follows:\n - 6 is not written on the sheet, so write 6.\n - 2 is not written on the sheet, so write 2.\n - 6 is written on the sheet, so erase 6.\nThus, the sheet contains only 2 in the end. The answer is 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
