It then checks if `X` is divisible by 5. If `X` is divisible by 5, it means the child's growth will be celebrated, and the program prints \"YES\". If `X` is not divisible by 5, it means the child's growth will not be celebrated, and the program prints \"NO\".\n\nIn the given sample input of 5, 5 is divisible by 5, so the output will be \"YES\".\n\"\"\"\n\nX = int(input())\nif X % 5 == 0:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe program first takes an integer input `X` from the user.

If it is, it prints \"YES\" because Takahashi's growth will be celebrated. If it is not, it prints \"NO\" because Takahashi's growth will not be celebrated.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that a number is divisible by 7 if it is divisible by 5 and 3, so the condition checks if X is divisible by 7, 5, or 3.\n\nThe modulo operator (%) is used to check if X is divisible by a number. If X modulo n is 0, then X is divisible by n.\n\nThis solution is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
