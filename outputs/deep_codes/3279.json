Bar Code is played on a square grid consisting of $n \\times n$ unit squares with $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ grid points. For a given specification, the puzzle requires the marking of some of the borders of these unit squares by drawing a vertical or horizontal bar, subject to the following conditions:\n - For each row/column, the specification describes exactly how many separate groups of consecutive bars of the same orientation (vertical and horizontal, resp.) there should be in this row/column. For instance, if the specification demands 2 1 1, then there have to be $3$ groups of $2$, $1$, and $1$ bars, separated by at least one unmarked border.
