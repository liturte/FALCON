The function `check` checks whether it is possible to sort all the letters in the string `s` by swapping them `k` times or more. It uses a list `count` to count the frequency of each letter in the string `s`. For each letter in the string, it increases the count of that letter in `count`. If the position of the letter is more than `k` positions away from the current position, it decreases the count of the letter that was at that position.", "from collections import Counter\n\ns, k = input().split()\nk = int(k)\n\ncount = Counter(s)\nkeys = sorted(count.keys())\n\nfor i in range(len(keys)):\n    if i > 0 and ord(keys[i]) - ord(keys[i-1]) < k:\n        print('No')\n        exit()\n\nprint('Yes')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem can be solved by using the concept of sorting and counting the frequency of each character. The idea is to check if there are any two characters that have a distance less than 'k'. If there is, it means we can't sort the string by swapping the characters. If there are no such pairs, we can sort the string by swapping the characters.\n\nIn the solution, we first count the frequency of each character using the Counter class from the collections module. Then we sort the keys of the counter (which are the characters in the string) and check if the distance between any two consecutive characters is less than 'k'. If it is, we print 'No' and exit the program. If no such pair is", "from collections import Counter\n\ndef solve(s, k):\n    c = Counter(s)\n    keys = sorted(c.keys())\n    for i in range(len(keys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(keys)):\n            if c[keys[j]] < c[keys[i]]:\n                return False\n            d = min(c[keys[j]] - c[keys[i]], (keys[j] - keys[i]) // k)\n            c[keys[i]] += d\n            c[keys[j]] -= d\n            if c[keys[j]] < c[keys[i]]:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ns, k = input().split()\nk = int(k)\nprint('Yes' if solve(s, k) else 'No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution is based on the fact that you can sort the string by swapping the letters. We first count the occurrences of each letter in the string.

Then it checks if all the counts are greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".", "s, k = input().split()\nk = int(k)\ns = list(s)\ns.sort()\n\ndef possible(i):\n    if i == len(s) - 1:\n        return True\n    if i == len(s):\n        return False\n    if abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i+1])) <= k:\n        return possible(i+1)\n    for j in range(i+2, len(s)):\n        if abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[j])) <= k:\n            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n            return possible(i+1)\n    return False\n\nprint('Yes' if possible(0) else 'No')\n\nThis code sorts the input string and then checks if it is possible to sort the letters in the string increasingly by making swaps. It uses a recursive function `possible` to check if the string can be sorted. The function takes an index `i` as input and checks if the `i`-th letter can be swapped with the `(i"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou have a string $s$ and you may modify it by making long swaps of its letters. Two letters can be swapped if their positions differ by at least $k$. That is, you may swap the $i$-th letter with the $j$-th letter in $s$ if $|i - j| \\geq k$. Is it possible to sort all the letters in $s$ increasingly, if you are allowed to swap any number of times (possibly zero)?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line has a string $s$ ($2 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$) and an integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq |s| - 1$), separated by a single space. The string $s$ consists of only lowercase letters.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to sort the letters increasingly, output \u201cYes\u201d.
