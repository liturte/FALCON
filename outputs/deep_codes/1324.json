Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly a_{i} calories on touching the i-th strip.\n\nYou've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 (0 \u2264 a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \u2264 10^4).\n\nThe second line contains string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 10^5), where the \u0456-th character of the string equals \"1\", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, \"2\", if it appears on the second strip, \"3\", if it appears on the third strip, \"4\", if it appears on the fourth strip.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the total number of calories that Jury wastes.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 3 4\n123214\n\nOutput\n13\n\nInput\n1 5 3 2\n11221\n\nOutput\n13\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
