It calculates the total weight of the masses on the left pan as A + B, and the total weight of the masses on the right pan as C + D. Then it compares these two values.

It then checks if the total weight of the masses on the left pan is greater than the total weight of the masses on the right pan. If it is, it prints \"Left\". If not, it checks if the total weights are equal. If they are, it prints \"Balanced\".

It then calculates the total weight of the masses on the left pan (A + B) and the right pan (C + D). If the total weight on the left pan is greater than the total weight on the right pan, it prints \"Left\". If the total weight on the right pan is greater than the total weight on the left pan, it prints \"Right\".
