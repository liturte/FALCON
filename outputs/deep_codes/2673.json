But he likes to invent his own. Now he plays game \"Digit Jump\". Chef has a sequence of digits $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots , S_{N}$. He is staying in the first digit $S_{1}$ and wants to reach the last digit $S_{N}$ in the minimal number of jumps. \nWhile staying in some index $i$ Chef can jump into $i - 1$ and $i + 1$, but he can't jump out from sequence. Or he can jump into any digit with the same value $S_i$. \nHelp Chef to find the minimal number of jumps he need to reach digit $S_{N}$ from digit $S_1$. \n\n-----Input-----\nInput contains a single line consist of string $S$ of length $N$ - the sequence of digits.\n\n-----Output-----\nIn a single line print single integer - the minimal number of jumps he needs.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1\\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- Each symbol of $S$ is a digit from $0$ to $9$. \n\n-----Example Input 1-----\n01234567890\n\n-----Example Output 1-----\n1\n\n-----Example Input 2-----\n012134444444443\n\n-----Example Output 2-----\n4\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTest Case 1: Chef can directly jump from the first digit (it is $0$) to the last (as it is also $0$).\nTest Case 2: Chef should follow the following path: $1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 15$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
