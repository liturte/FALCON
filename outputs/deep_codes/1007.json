A number is palindrome means when written in decimal representation, it contains no leading zeros and reads the same forwards and backwards. For example 12321 and 1221 are palindromes and 123 and 12451 are not. Moreover, 1221 is zcy number and 12321 is not.\n\nGiven integers k and p, calculate the sum of the k smallest zcy numbers and output this sum modulo p.\n\nUnfortunately, Willem isn't good at solving this kind of problems, so he asks you for help!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers k and p (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput single integer\u00a0\u2014 answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 100\n\nOutput\n33\n\nInput\n5 30\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the smallest zcy number is 11, and the second smallest zcy number is 22.\n\nIn the second example, $(11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55) \\operatorname{mod} 30 = 15$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
