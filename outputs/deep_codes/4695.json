Then it checks if x and y are in the same group by using the 'in' keyword in Python. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. If not, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe map function is used to read the input from the user, and the split function is used to split the input into two separate integers.", "x, y = map(int, input().split())\nif x < 4 and y < 4:\n    print('Yes')\nelif x > 3 and y > 3:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis solution works by reading the input values x and y. Then, it checks if x and y are less than 4, which means they belong to the first group (1, 2, or 3). If they are greater than 3, they belong to the third group (9, 10, or 11, 12). If neither of these conditions are met, then x and y must belong to the second group (4, 5, or 6), and so it prints 'Yes'.\n\nThis solution assumes that the groups are formed by consecutive integers. If the groups are formed by non-consecutive integers, then the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this solution is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nThere are n people in a room, where each person is numbered from 1 to n.\nYou are given a list of pairs of people, each pair representing a pair of people who know each other.\nDetermine the number of ways to divide the people into two groups such that each person belongs to exactly one group and no two people from the same pair know each other.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - n \u2264 20\n\n-----Input", "x, y = map(int, input().split())\nif x // 4 == y // 4:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis code works by dividing the numbers 1 through 12 into three groups of 4. The first group contains the numbers 1-4, the second group contains the numbers 5-8, and the third group contains the numbers 9-12. The '//' operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient. So if x // 4 and y // 4 are equal, it means that x and y belong to the same group, and the code prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, the code prints \"No\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the numbers are grouped into 4s, but it can be easily modified to group them into other sizes.\n\nNote: The '//' operator in Python performs floor division, which means it rounds the result down to the nearest whole number. This is important in this context because we want to know which group x and y belong to, not their position within that group.\n\nAlso, this solution does not handle any potential errors or invalid input.\n\nPlease note that the provided solution is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------------------------\n# SOLUTION 2\n# -------------------------\n\n\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nGiven a string S consisting of N characters, your task is to determine", "x, y = map(int, input().split())\nif x // 4 == y // 4:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe numbers 1-12 are divided into three groups. If the numbers are divisible by 4, they belong to the same group. So, we can check if x // 4 is equal to y // 4. If they are, then x and y belong to the same group and we print 'Yes'. Otherwise, they belong to different groups and we print 'No'.\n\nThis code is a Python solution for the problem. It reads two integers x and y from the input, then checks if they belong to the same group. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis solution assumes that the numbers are grouped into three groups of four numbers each. If the groups are different sizes, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the input is valid, i.e., x and y are integers in the range 1 to 12, and x is less than y. If this is not the case, the solution would need to add error checking to handle invalid input.\n\nNote: The '//' operator is used for integer division in Python, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division. This is used to determine which group the numbers belong to.\n\nThe 'map' function is used to read the input as a list of integers.
