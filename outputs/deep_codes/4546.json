The `map()` function is then used to convert these strings into integers. The heights of the poles are stored in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nThe if statement checks if the difference between the heights of the second and first pole (`b - a`) equals the difference between the heights of the third and second pole (`c - b`). If these two differences are equal, the code prints \"YES\".

If it is, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nNote: The input() function is used to get the input from the user. The split() function is used to split the input into multiple parts based on the space. The map() function is used to apply the int() function to all the elements of the split input. The if-else statement is used to check the condition and print the output accordingly.\n\"\"\"\n\n# This code is a Python solution to the problem.\n\na, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif b - a == c - b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n\"\"\"\nThe code reads the input from the user, which are the heights of the three poles (a, b, c), and checks if the difference between the heights of the two poles is equal to the difference", "a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\nif b - a == c - b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThis code reads three integers from the input, and checks if the difference between the second and first integer is equal to the difference between the third and second integer.
