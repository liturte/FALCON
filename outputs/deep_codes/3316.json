Unfortunately, New York being New York, the tickets are just a tiny bit expensive. But one of the shows has a ticket lottery each night where impecunious people such as yourself have a chance to win the right to buy slightly less expensive tickets to good seats. \n\nThe lottery operates as follows. First, everyone interested enters the lottery. Then, $n$ lucky winners are drawn, and each of these is offered to buy up to $t$ tickets.\n\nGiven the number of people $p$ in your group (all of which entered the lottery) and the total number of people $m$ that entered the lottery, what is the probability that you will be able to get tickets for your entire group? Assume that the $n$ lucky winners are chosen uniformly at random from the $m$ people that entered the lottery, and that each person can win at most once.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing four integers:\n - $1 \\le m \\le 1000$: the total number of people who entered the lottery.\n - $1 \\le n \\le m$: the total number of winners drawn.\n - $1 \\le t \\le 100$: the number of tickets each winner is allowed to buy.\n - $1 \\le p \\le m$: the number of people in your group.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line containing the probability that your entire group can get tickets to the show. This probability should be given with an absolute error of at most $10^{-9}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n100 10 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n0.1\n\nSample Input 2:\n100 10 2 2\nSample Output 2:\n0.1909090909\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
