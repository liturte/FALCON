Now, the remaining students are $1$, $2$, $4$ and $5$. We can select students $1$, $2$ and $4$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $3$. Note, that we can't select students $1$, $2$ and $5$, as students $2$ and $5$ belong to the same club. Also, we can't select students $1$, $3$ and $4$, since student $3$ has left their club.\n\nOn the second day, student $2$ leaves their club. Now, the remaining students are $1$, $4$ and $5$. We can select students $1$, $4$ and $5$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$.\n\nOn the third day, the remaining students are $1$ and $5$. We can select students $1$ and $5$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$.\n\nOn the fourth day, the remaining student is $1$. We can select student $1$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$. \n\nOn the fifth day, no club has students and so the maximum possible strength is $0$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
