The interview is in a skyscraper and you are currently in floor $s$, where you see an elevator. Upon entering the elvator, you learn that it has only two buttons, marked \u201cUP $u$\u201d and \u201cDOWN$d$\u201d. You conclude that the UP-button takes the elevator $u$ floors up (if there aren\u2019t enough floors, pressing the UP-botton does nothing, or at least so you assume), whereas the DOWN-button takes you $d$ stories down (or none if there aren\u2019t enough). Knowing that the interview is at floor $g$, and that there are only $f$ floors in the building, you quickly decide to write a program that gives you the amount of button pushes you need to perform. If you simply cannot reach the correct floor, your program halts with the message \u201cuse the stairs\u201d.\n\nGiven input $f$, $s$, $g$, $u$ and $d$ (floors, start, goal, up, down), find the shortest sequence of button presses you must press in order to get from $s$ to $g$, given a building of $f$ floors, or output \u201cuse the stairs\u201d if you cannot get from $s$ to $g$ by the given elevator.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input will consist of one line with the five integers $f$, $s$, $g$, $u$, and $d$, where $1 \\leq s,g \\leq f \\leq 1000000$ and $0 \\leq u,d \\leq 1000000$. The floors are one-indexed, i.e., if there are 10 stories, $s$ and $g$ are between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum numbers of pushes you must make in order to get from $s$ to $g$, or output use the stairs if it is impossible given the configuration of the elvator.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 1 10 2 1\nSample Output:\n6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
