It then counts the number of mountains for which the height is greater than or equal to the maximum height of the mountains seen so far. This is done by using a generator expression that yields True for each mountain for which this is the case, and False otherwise. The sum function then adds up these True values, giving the total number of inns from which the ocean can be seen.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N^2), because for each mountain, it scans the heights of all the mountains seen so far.

The max function is used to determine the maximum height of any inn to the left of the current inn. The sum function then adds up these boolean values to give the total number of inns that can see the ocean.\n\nThe input() function is used to read the number of inns N and the heights of the inns H from the standard input.

The generator generates a sequence of 1s for each mountain that can see the ocean and 0s for those that can't. The sum function then adds up these 1s to give the total number of inns that can see the ocean.\n'''", "N = int(input())\nH = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncount = 0\nmax_height = 0\nfor h in H:\n    if h >= max_height:\n        count += 1\n        max_height = h\n\nprint(count)\n\n\nThis code reads the number of mountains and their heights from the input.

To see the ocean from a particular inn, the inn's height must be greater than or equal to the maximum height of all the inns to the west of it.\n\nThe python code takes the number of inns (N) and the heights of the inns (H) as input. It then uses a generator expression to create a list of True/False values where True indicates that the inn can see the ocean and False indicates that it cannot. The sum() function then returns the total count of True values, which"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.\nAt the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.\nThe height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.\nYou can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.\nFor the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \\leq H_i, H_2 \\leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \\leq H_i.\nFrom how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 20\n - 1 \\leq H_i \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nH_1 H_2 ...
