This is because the greatest common divisor of n and n // 2 is n // 2.\n\nHowever, this solution does not work for k > 2 because the problem statement says that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal.

If so, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to create a sequence of that length. If `k` is `1`, it simply returns `n`.\n\nIf `k` is greater than `1`, it checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it returns a list of half of `n` and half of `n` (if `k` is `2`) or `-1` (if `k` is not `2`). If `n` is not even, it returns a list of half of `n", "import math\n\ndef solve(n, k):\n    if n < k:\n        return [-1]\n    res = [n // k] * k\n    r = n % k\n    for i in range(r):\n        res[i] += 1\n    res.sort()\n    return res\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nres = solve(n, k)\nif res[0] == -1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is based on the fact that the elements of the sequence are as close as possible. If the remainder of the division of n by k is zero, each element of the sequence is n // k. If the remainder is not zero, we add 1 to the first r elements of the sequence and then sort the sequence in ascending order. If n < k, the sequence is impossible, so we return [-1].\n\nThe input is read from the standard input and the output is written to the standard output.", "def max_gcd(n, k):\n    if n < k:\n        return [-1]\n    if n == k:\n        return list(range(1, k + 1))\n    if k == 1:\n        return [n]\n    return [n - k + 2] + [1] * (k - 1)\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nresult = max_gcd(n, k)\nif -1 in result:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(*result)\n\nIn this solution, we are trying to maximize the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the sequence. To do this, we need to assign the maximum possible numbers to the elements of the sequence. \n\nFor example, if n=6 and k=3, we can assign [1, 2, 3] to the sequence, where gcd is 1. If n=8 and k=2, we can assign [2, 6] to the sequence, where gcd is 2. If n=5 and k=3, we cannot find such sequence where gcd is maximal, so we output -1.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that", "def solve(n, k):\n    if n < k:\n        return [-1]\n    if k == 1:\n        return [n]\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return [n // 2, n // 2]\n    else:\n        return [n // 2, n // 2 + 1]\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nresult = solve(n, k)\nif result[0] == -1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(*result)\n\n\nThis solution works by creating a sequence where each number is half the total sum of the sequence. If the total sum is even, then each number is half the total sum. If the total sum is odd, then one of the numbers is half the total sum and the other is half the total sum plus one.\n\nThis solution is correct because the maximum possible greatest common divisor of a sequence of numbers is the minimum number in the sequence. Therefore, the best strategy is to make each number as close to half the total sum as possible. This ensures that the greatest common divisor is maximized.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it always performs a constant number"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given positive integer number n.
