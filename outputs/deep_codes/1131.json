Today they've got a competition. \n\nArthur took a group of four integers a, b, w, x (0 \u2264 b < w, 0 < x < w) and Alexander took integer \u0441. Arthur and Alexander use distinct approaches to number bustings. Alexander is just a regular guy. Each second, he subtracts one from his number. In other words, he performs the assignment: c = c - 1. Arthur is a sophisticated guy. Each second Arthur performs a complex operation, described as follows: if b \u2265 x, perform the assignment b = b - x, if b < x, then perform two consecutive assignments a = a - 1;\u00a0b = w - (x - b).\n\nYou've got numbers a, b, w, x, c. Determine when Alexander gets ahead of Arthur if both guys start performing the operations at the same time. Assume that Alexander got ahead of Arthur if c \u2264 a.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers a, b, w, x, c (1 \u2264 a \u2264 2\u00b710^9, 1 \u2264 w \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 b < w, 0 < x < w, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 2\u00b710^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum time in seconds Alexander needs to get ahead of Arthur. You can prove that the described situation always occurs within the problem's limits.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2 3 1 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 2 3 1 7\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1 2 3 2 6\n\nOutput\n13\n\nInput\n1 1 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
