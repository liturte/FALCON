Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\n\nLet A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). \n\nWrite a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200) \u2014 length of string s.\n\nThe second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11\naaaaBaabAbA\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n12\nzACaAbbaazzC\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\nABC\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.\n\nIn the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.\n\nIn the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
