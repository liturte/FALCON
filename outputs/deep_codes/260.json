We start with the range [1, 10^18] and keep dividing the range in half until we find the number that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe binary search is performed by counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number in the range. If the count is greater than or equal to m, we know that the number is valid and we can update our right boundary. If the count is less than m, we know that the number is invalid and we can update", "def find_n(m, k):\n    l, r = 1, 10**18\n    while l < r:\n        mid = (l + r) // 2\n        if sum(min(2**k, mid - mid//2 + 1) for k in range(64)) < m:\n            l = mid + 1\n        else:\n            r = mid\n    n = l\n    cnt = sum(min(2**k, n - n//2 + 1) for k in range(64))\n    for k in range(64):\n        if cnt + min(2**k, n - n//2 + 1) == m:\n            return n + 2**k - 1\n        cnt -= min(2**k, n - n//2 + 1)\n\nm, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_n(m, k))\n\nThis code uses binary search to find the required number n.

She came closer and read: \"Find such positive integer n, that among numbers n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2\u00b7n there are exactly m numbers which binary representation contains exactly k digits one\".\n\nThe girl got interested in the task and she asked you to help her solve it. Sasha knows that you are afraid of large numbers, so she guaranteed that there is an answer that doesn't exceed 10^18.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, m and k (0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^18; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 64).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the required number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^18). If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 2\n\nOutput\n5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
