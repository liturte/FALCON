This can be achieved by moving the second rectangle to the left or right by a distance of 1, as long as this distance does not exceed the width of the second rectangle.\n\nThe three absolute differences are calculated to cover all possible cases:\n1. abs(a+W-b): the distance from the right edge of the first rectangle to the left edge of the second rectangle.\n2.", "W, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(abs(a - (b + W)), abs((a + W) - b)))\n\n\nThis solution is based on the mathematical fact that the distance between two rectangles is the distance between their closest points. The closest point on the first rectangle to the second rectangle is at (a, 1) and the closest point on the second rectangle to the first rectangle is at (b+W, 0). Therefore, the minimum distance is the distance between these two points, which is |a - (b + W)| or |(a + W) - b|.\n\nThe Python code uses the built-in `min` function to find the minimum of the two distances. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two coordinates. The `map` function is used to read the input and convert it to integers. The `input().split()` function is used", "W, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(abs(a - (b + W)), abs((a + W) - b)))\n\n\nThis solution works by calculating the absolute differences between the left edges of the two rectangles and choosing the minimum of these two values. The minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved is the lesser of these two differences.\n\nThe function `abs` calculates the absolute value of a number, and the function `map` applies a function to all items in an input list. In this case, the function is `int`, which converts a string to an integer, and `input().split()` splits the input string into a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input. `map` applies `int` to each string in the list, converting them all to integers.\n\nFinally, `print` outputs the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAtCoDeer the deer found two rectangles lying on the table, each with height 1 and width W.\nIf we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], and the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W], as shown in the following figure:\n\nAtCoDeer will move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.\nFind the minimum distance it needs to be moved.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All input values are integers.\n - 1\u2264W\u226410^5\n - 1\u2264a,b\u226410^5\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nW a b\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nThis input corresponds to the figure in the statement.
