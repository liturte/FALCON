The area of the crust is the same as the area of a circle with a radius $R$ minus the area of a circle with a radius $R-C$. Therefore, the area of the crust is $\\pi (R^2 - (R-C)^2)$. The area of the cheese is the area of the pizza minus the area of the crust. Therefore, the percentage of the pizza that has cheese is $100 \\times \\frac{\\text{area of the cheese}}{\\text{area of the pizza}}$.\n\nThis code reads the radius $R$ and the crust width $C$, calculates the area of the crust and the area of the pizza, and then calculates and prints the percentage of the pizza that has cheese.\n\nThe percentage is calculated as a floating-point number, so the result is accurate to within $10^{-6}$. The area calculations are also floating-point numbers, so the result is accurate to within $10^{-6}$.\n\nThe code uses the `map` function to read the input and the", "R, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(((R**2 - (R-C)**2) / R**2) * 100)\n\n\nThis code takes the radius and crust radius as input.

The result is printed as a floating point number.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $\\pi r^2$, so the area of the pizza is $\\pi R^2$ and the area of the crust is $\\pi (R-C)^2$. The area of the cheese is therefore $\\pi R^2 - \\pi (R-C)^2$.\n\nThe percentage of the pizza that has cheese is then given by $(\\pi R^2 - \\pi (R-C)^2) / \\pi R^2$. This simplifies to the formula used in the code.\n\nThe output of this code is the percentage of the pizza that has cheese. The error is at most $10^{-6}$ because the area calculations are floating point numbers, and the percentage calculation is done with floating point arithmetic.\n\nThis code works within the", "import sys\n\nR, C = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\ncheese_area = (R**2 - (R-C)**2) * 3.141592653589793\ntotal_area = R**2 * 3.141592653589793\n\nprint(cheese_area / total_area * 100)\n\n\nThis code reads the radius and crust thickness from the input, calculates the areas of the cheese and total pizza, and then prints the percentage of the pizza that has cheese.
