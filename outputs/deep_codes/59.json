Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in this array.\n\nFor some indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) it is possible to swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th, for other indices it is not possible. You may perform any number of swapping operations any order. There is no limit on the number of times you swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th (if the position is not forbidden).\n\nCan you make this array sorted in ascending order performing some sequence of swapping operations?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 200000) \u2014 the elements of the array. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.\n\nThe third line contains a string of n - 1 characters, each character is either 0 or 1. If i-th character is 1, then you can swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th any number of times, otherwise it is forbidden to swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is possible to sort the array in ascending order using any sequence of swaps you are allowed to make, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 2 5 3 4 6\n01110\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6\n1 2 5 3 4 6\n01010\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you may swap a_3 and a_4, and then swap a_4 and a_5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
