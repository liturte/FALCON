For your birthday, your friends have given you an array a consisting of n distinct integers.\n\nUnfortunately, the size of a is too small. You want a bigger array! Your friends agree to give you a bigger array, but only if you are able to answer the following question correctly: is it possible to sort the array a (in increasing order) by reversing exactly one segment of a? See definitions of segment and reversing in the notes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of array a.\n\nThe second line contains n distinct space-separated integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (1 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"yes\" or \"no\" (without quotes), depending on the answer.\n\nIf your answer is \"yes\", then also print two space-separated integers denoting start and end (start must not be greater than end) indices of the segment to be reversed. If there are multiple ways of selecting these indices, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n3 2 1\n\nOutput\nyes\n1 3\n\nInput\n4\n2 1 3 4\n\nOutput\nyes\n1 2\n\nInput\n4\n3 1 2 4\n\nOutput\nno\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\nyes\n1 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nSample 1. You can reverse the entire array to get [1, 2, 3], which is sorted.\n\nSample 3. No segment can be reversed such that the array will be sorted.\n\nDefinitions\n\nA segment [l, r] of array a is the sequence a[l], a[l + 1], ..., a[r].\n\nIf you have an array a of size n and you reverse its segment [l, r], the array will become:\n\na[1], a[2], ..., a[l - 2], a[l - 1], a[r], a[r - 1], ..., a[l + 1], a[l], a[r + 1], a[r + 2], ..., a[n - 1], a[n].\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
