If he has written the fastest solution on a problem he screams \u201cI\u2019m amazing\u201d in pure joy. However if his solution is not the fastest he likes to find out if he is the best Thore, or maybe the best ThoreH on the scoreboard. He is the best ThoreH if there is another Thore above him, but no ThoreH above him. Once a terrible incident took place where Thore misread the scoreboard and thought that he was the best, but instead it was some other Thore who was amazing. Now he needs your help to find the smallest prefix that uniquely determines himself on the scoreboard. \n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single number $n$, where $1 < n \\leq 100$.\n\nThen follows $n$ lines with a name on each line.\n\nEach name only contains characters from the set $\\big [\\text {a-zA-Z}\\big ]$, i.e. lower and upper case English letters.
