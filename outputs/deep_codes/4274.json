If they are equal, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.\n\nThis code works because in order for a submission to get an AC verdict, all test cases must pass. Therefore, if the number of passed test cases equals the total number of test cases, then all test cases have passed and the submission gets an AC verdict.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the inputs will always be integers and that the number of passed test cases will not be greater than the total number of test cases.", "N, M = map(int, input().split())\nif M == N:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis Python code takes two inputs, N and M. It then checks if M is equal to N. If they are equal, it prints \"Yes\" indicating that the submission is correct.

If the problem statement allows for more or fewer test cases to be passed, additional checks would be required.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it executes in constant time.
