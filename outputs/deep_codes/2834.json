It starts with the lucky numbers 4 and 7. Then it generates all the lucky numbers by appending the lucky digits (4 and 7) to the numbers in the queue. This process continues until the queue has enough numbers. The K-th lucky number is then returned.\n\nThis program assumes that the input K is a positive integer and that it is within the range of 1 to 10^9. It does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur if the input is not in the correct range.\n\nPlease note that this program uses a brute-force approach to generate the lucky numbers, which may not be efficient for large values of K. In a real-world scenario, a more efficient algorithm or data structure would be used to generate the lucky numbers.\n\nAlso, please note that the efficiency of this program can be improved by using a priority queue or a heap data structure to keep track of the smallest unprocessed number.

It starts with 4 and 7 as the first two lucky numbers. It then generates all possible lucky numbers by adding 4 and 7 to each of the existing numbers. It continues this process until it has found the K-th lucky number. The found lucky numbers are stored in a list and the K-th number is returned.\n\nPlease note that the input is expected to be a positive integer K (1 <= K <= 10^9).\n\nThe time complexity of the code is O(logK) because each number is processed only once, and the number of digits in each number is logarithmic to K. The space complexity is also O(logK) because in the worst case, all the numbers generated by the code are stored in the queue.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle cases where K is greater than the", "def kth_lucky_number(k):\n    lucky_numbers = [4, 7]\n    i = 0\n    while len(lucky_numbers) < k:\n        new_number = lucky_numbers[i]*10 + 4\n        lucky_numbers.append(new_number)\n        new_number = lucky_numbers[i]*10 + 7\n        lucky_numbers.append(new_number)\n        i += 1\n    return lucky_numbers[k-1]\n\nk = int(input())\nprint(kth_lucky_number(k))\n\n\nThis code creates a list of all lucky numbers by continuously appending new lucky numbers to the list. The new lucky numbers are created by appending the digits 4 and 7 to the current number. The current number is chosen from the list of lucky numbers in a round-robin fashion. The k-th lucky number is then returned.\n\nNote: The input k is 1-indexed, so the k-th lucky number is returned by accessing the (k-1)-th element of the list.\n\nThis solution works by creating a list of all lucky numbers up to the k-th number in a round-robin fashion. The time complexity is O(k) and the space complexity is O(k).\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is a valid positive integer. If the input is not valid, the code will not work as expected.", "def kth_lucky_number(k):\n    lucky_digits = [4, 7]\n    lucky_numbers = []\n    for i in range(1, 14):\n        generate_numbers(lucky_digits, lucky_numbers, \"\", i)\n    lucky_numbers.sort()\n    return lucky_numbers[k - 1]\n\ndef generate_numbers(lucky_digits, lucky_numbers, current, length):\n    if len(current) == length:\n        lucky_numbers.append(int(current))\n    else:\n        for digit in lucky_digits:\n            generate_numbers(lucky_digits, lucky_numbers, current + str(digit), length)\n\nk = int(input().strip())\nprint(kth_lucky_number(k))\n\n\nThis solution uses a depth-first search to generate all possible lucky numbers, then sorts them and returns the K-th element. The time complexity of this solution is O(log(K)) as it generates a total of log(K) numbers.\n\nPlease note that this solution may not be efficient for large K due to its time complexity.\n\nTo make it more efficient, we can use the following mathematical approach:\n\nA number is lucky if and only if it is of the form 4^i * 7^j, where i and j are non-negative integers. Therefore, the K-th lucky number", "def kth_lucky_number(k):\n    lucky_numbers = [4, 7]\n    while len(lucky_numbers) < k + 1:\n        new_number = lucky_numbers[-1] * 10 + 4\n        lucky_numbers.append(new_number)\n        new_number = lucky_numbers[-2] * 10 + 7\n        lucky_numbers.append(new_number)\n    return lucky_numbers[k]\n\nk = int(input())\nprint(kth_lucky_number(k))\n\n\nThis Python program uses a list to store all the lucky numbers. It starts with the list containing the numbers 4 and 7, and then generates new lucky numbers by appending 4 and 7 to the last number in the list. It keeps doing this until the list contains the K-th lucky number. Finally, it prints out the K-th lucky number.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(K), because it generates K lucky numbers. The space complexity is also O(K), because it stores K lucky numbers in the list.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the input K is a positive integer and is not larger than 10^9, as specified in the problem statement. If the input might be larger, you should add error checking to handle this case.\n\nAlso, this program uses the modulo operator to find the K-th digit in the list, but it's not"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nDigits $4$ and $7$ are lucky, while all others are unlucky.
