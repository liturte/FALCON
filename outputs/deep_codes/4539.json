This is done by converting `n` to a string, iterating over its digits, converting each digit back to an integer, and summing them up. The result is then checked against the remainder of `n` divided by this sum.

If the input may not be valid, you should add error handling code to handle invalid inputs.\n\nAlso, please note that this script is written in Python 3.\n\nThis script can be run in a Python 3 environment.

It does this by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character in the string (which are the digits), converting them back to integers, and summing them. It then checks if the number is divisible by this sum.\n\nThe main part of the code reads a number from the input, checks if it is a Harshad number by calling `is_harshad`, and prints either 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is a valid integer and does not check for invalid inputs.\n\nThe code is written in Python and does not contain any comments or explanations. It is as pure as it can be.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(d), where d is the number of digits in the input number. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input number and the sum of its digits.\n\nNote: This code works for Python 3.

It then prints \"Yes\" if N is a Harshad number and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe `sum(map(int, str(N)))` part converts N to a string and maps each character back to an integer, summing these to get the sum of the digits. The `N % sum(map(int, str(N)))` part calculates the remainder of N divided by this sum. If the remainder is 0, N is divisible by the sum, and is therefore a Harshad number.\n\nThe `print` statement uses a ternary operator to print \"Yes\" if the remainder is 0, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThis code works for all valid inputs in the given constraints."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAn integer X is called a Harshad number if X is divisible by f(X), where f(X) is the sum of the digits in X when written in base 10.\nGiven an integer N, determine whether it is a Harshad number.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1?N?10^8\n - N is an integer.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint Yes if N is a Harshad number; print No otherwise.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n12\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nf(12)=1+2=3.
