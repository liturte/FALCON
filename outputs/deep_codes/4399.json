{"4399": {"code": ["S = input()\nif 'A' in S and 'B' in S:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis Python program solves the problem by reading a string S from the standard input. It then checks if both 'A' and 'B' are in the string S. If both are present, it prints 'Yes', indicating that there is at least one pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service. If either 'A' or 'B' is not present in the string, it prints 'No', indicating that there are no pairs of stations that will be connected by a bus service.", "S = input()\nif S[0] == S[1] or S[1] == S[2] or S[2] == S[0]:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code first takes input for the string S. Then it checks if any two of the characters in S are the same. If they are, it prints 'Yes' because there is a pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service. If not, it prints 'No'.\n\nThe condition `S[0] == S[1] or S[1] == S[2] or S[2] == S[0]` checks if any two of the stations operated by the same company are adjacent to each other. If any such pair exists, a bus service can be established between them, so 'Yes' is printed. If not, 'No' is printed.\n\n\nThis code takes the input string S and checks", "print('Yes' if 'ABA' in input() or 'BAB' in input() or 'AAB' in input() else 'No')\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input string and checking if any of the possible combinations of bus services are present in the string. The combinations are 'ABA', 'BAB', and 'AAB', which represent the possible connections between stations operated by Company A and Company B. If any of these combinations are present, it means there is a bus service between the corresponding stations, so it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nNote: The solution assumes that the input string will always be a 3-character string consisting of 'A' and 'B'. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.\n\nAlso note that this solution does not handle the case where the input string is not exactly 3 characters long. If this is a possibility, additional error checking should be added.\n\nThe solution", "S = input()\nif S[0] == 'A' and S[2] == 'A' or S[0] == 'B' and S[2] == 'B':\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nThis code reads the input string, S, and checks if the first and third characters of S are the same. If they are, it prints \"Yes\", indicating that there is a bus service between the two stations operated by the same company. If the first and third characters are not the same, it prints \"No\", indicating that there is no bus service between the two stations operated by the same company.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input string S is a string of length 3 and that each character in S is either 'A' or 'B'. If this is not the case, the code may not behave as expected.", "S = input()\nif S[0] == S[1] or S[1] == S[2] or S[0] == S[2]:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nThis code reads a string S from the input, and then checks if there are two occurrences of the same character in the string. If there are, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThe condition for the bus service to be possible is that the two stations operated by the same company are next to each other in the string. This can be checked by comparing adjacent characters of the string. If there are two occurrences of the same character next to each other in the string, it means that there is a bus service between the stations operated by the same company.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(1), as it only performs a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), as"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn AtCoder City, there are three stations numbered 1, 2, and 3.\nEach of these stations is operated by one of the two railway companies, A and B. A string S of length 3 represents which company operates each station.
