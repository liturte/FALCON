We iterate through the array A and for each element a, we remove all elements that are smaller than a from the set of colors. This is because if these elements were painted with a color, they would not satisfy the condition that A_i < A_j. Then we add a to the set of colors. The size of the set of colors at the end of the iteration is the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition.\n\nThis solution works in O(N log N) time because of the usage of sets and the sorting of the elements in the set. The", "from sys import stdin\n\ndef main():\n    _ = stdin.readline()\n    A = list(map(int, stdin.readlines()))\n    print(len(set(A)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nThis solution works by simply reading the input, and then printing the number of unique elements. Since we need to paint the integers such that for any two indices i < j, if A_i = A_j, then A_i < A_j, we just need to ensure that we have at least as many colors as there are unique elements in the sequence.\n\nIn the provided sample input, the unique elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so we need 5 colors to satisfy the condition. However, since the minimum number of colors required is 2, we can satisfy the condition with 2 colors by painting 2 and 3 red and painting 1, 4, and 5 blue.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N log N", "import sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\nnums = [int(sys.stdin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\ncolors = set()\n\nfor num in nums:\n    while num in colors:\n        colors.remove(num)\n        num += 1\n    colors.add(num)\n\nprint(len(colors))\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating through the input numbers. For each number, it removes all smaller numbers from the set of colors, because they are guaranteed to be painted with a color smaller than the current number. Then it adds the current number to the set of colors. The size of the set of colors is the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N log N) due to the use of a set for storing the colors and removing elements. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the input numbers and the set of colors.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\nThis solution works by iterating through the input", "import sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\ncolors = [0]*n\nmin_color = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0 or a[i] > a[i-1]:\n        colors[i] = min_color\n        min_color += 1\n    else:\n        colors[i] = colors[i-1]\n\nprint(min_color)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is based on the fact that we need to ensure that for every two consecutive numbers, the smaller one is painted with a color that is different from the larger one. This ensures that the condition A_i < A_j is satisfied.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n- Initialize an array `colors` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This array will store the color of each number.\n- Initialize a variable `min_color` to 0.
