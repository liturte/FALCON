To congratulate Alexey on the Teacher's Day, the students have gifted him a collection of wooden sticks, where every stick has an integer length. Now Alexey wants to grow a tree from them.\n\nThe tree looks like a polyline on the plane, consisting of all sticks. The polyline starts at the point $(0, 0)$. While constructing the polyline, Alexey will attach sticks to it one by one in arbitrary order. Each stick must be either vertical or horizontal (that is, parallel to $OX$ or $OY$ axis). It is not allowed for two consecutive sticks to be aligned simultaneously horizontally or simultaneously vertically. See the images below for clarification.\n\nAlexey wants to make a polyline in such a way that its end is as far as possible from $(0, 0)$. Please help him to grow the tree this way.\n\nNote that the polyline defining the form of the tree may have self-intersections and self-touches, but it can be proved that the optimal answer does not contain any self-intersections or self-touches.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks Alexey got as a present.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10\\,000$) \u2014 the lengths of the sticks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the square of the largest possible distance from $(0, 0)$ to the tree end.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n26\nInput\n4\n1 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe following pictures show optimal trees for example tests. The squared distance in the first example equals $5 \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 26$, and in the second example $4 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 20$.\n\n [Image] \n\n [Image]\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
