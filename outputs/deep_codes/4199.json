It then counts and prints the number of friends who are at least the minimum height.\n\nThe function `sum(h >= K for h in H)` is a generator that yields `True` for each friend whose height is greater than or equal to the minimum height, and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up these `True` and `False` values, effectively counting the number of friends who meet the minimum height requirement.\n\"\"\"\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nH = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(sum(h >= K for h in H))\n\n\nThe given solution is a simple Python program that reads the number of friends, the minimum height required,", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nH = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprint(sum(h >= K for h in H))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis program first reads the number of friends `N` and the minimum height `K`, and the heights `H` of the friends.\nThen it counts the number of friends whose height is greater than or equal to `K`.\nThe `sum(h >= K for h in H)` part is a generator expression that creates a sequence of `True` and `False` values for each friend.

It first reads the number of friends N and the minimum height K. Then it reads the heights of the N friends. The heights are stored in the list H. \n\nThen it iterates through the list H. If the height of a friend is greater than or equal to K, it increments the counter cnt. \n\nFinally, it prints the value of cnt, which is the number of friends who can ride the roller coaster.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the list of friends once.\n'''\n\n\n'''\nQUESTION:\nYou are given an array A of N integers.

The condition is", "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nH = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprint(sum(h >= K for h in H))\n\n\nThis solution works by using Python's built-in `map` function to apply the `int` function to each element in the input, and `sum` function to count the number of elements that are greater than or equal to K.\n\nNote: The input() function is used to get the input from the user, and the split() method is used to split the input into a list of strings. The map() function is used to apply a particular function (in this case, the int() function) to each item of an iterable (in this case, the list of strings). The list() function is used to convert the map object to a list. The sum() function is used to add up the elements of the list.\n\nThe comparison operator (>=) is used to compare the elements of the list with K.
