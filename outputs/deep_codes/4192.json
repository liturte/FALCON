If Takahashi will reach the place in time, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nIt uses the Python `map` function to convert the input strings to integers, and the `input().split()` function to split the input line into a list of strings. The `if` statement then checks if the time Takahashi needs to reach the place is less than or equal to the time they have planned to meet, and prints \"Yes\" if it is, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe calculation for time is `D / S`, where `D` is the distance to the place, `S` is the speed of Takahashi, and `T` is the time they have planned to meet.\n\"\"\"", "D, T, S = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yes\" if D / S <= T else \"No\")\n\n\nThis program works by taking the distance to the place, the speed of Takahashi, and the time they have planned to meet as input. It then calculates the time it would take for Takahashi to reach the place if he traveled at his speed. If this time is less than or equal to the time they have planned to meet, it prints \"Yes\". Otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution:\n# The solution is a simple conditional check. \n# If the distance travelled by Takahashi in time (D/S) is less than or equal to the time they have planned to meet (T), Takahashi will arrive in time.\n# Otherwise, he will not arrive in time.\n# The result of this comparison is printed to the standard output.\n\n\n# Code:\n\nD, T, S = map(int, input", "D, T, S = map(int, input().split())\nif D / S <= T:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads three integers from the input. The distance to the place (D), the planned meeting time (T), and Takahashi's speed (S). It then calculates how long it will take Takahashi to reach the place (D / S). If this time is less than or equal to the planned meeting time (T), Takahashi will arrive in time and the code prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, he will not arrive in time and the code prints 'No'.\n\nThis is a simple arithmetic problem. The key is to understand that the time it takes to reach the place is the distance divided by the speed. If this time is less than or equal to the planned meeting time, Takahashi will arrive in time."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi is meeting up with Aoki.\nThey have planned to meet at a place that is D meters away from Takahashi's house in T minutes from now.\nTakahashi will leave his house now and go straight to the place at a speed of S meters per minute.\nWill he arrive in time?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq D \\leq 10000\n - 1 \\leq T \\leq 10000\n - 1 \\leq S \\leq 10000\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nD T S\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Takahashi will reach the place in time, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1000 15 80\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nIt takes 12.5 minutes to go 1000 meters to the place at a speed of 80 meters per minute.
