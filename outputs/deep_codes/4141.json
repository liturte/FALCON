The document carried by an immigrant has some number of integers written on it, and you need to check whether they meet certain criteria.\nAccording to the regulation, the immigrant should be allowed entry to the kingdom if and only if the following condition is satisfied:\n - All even numbers written on the document are divisible by 3 or 5.\nIf the immigrant should be allowed entry according to the regulation, output APPROVED; otherwise, print DENIED.\n\n-----Notes-----\n - The condition in the statement can be rephrased as \"If x is an even number written on the document, x is divisible by 3 or 5\".\nHere \"if\" and \"or\" are logical terms.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 1000\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\dots A_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the immigrant should be allowed entry according to the regulation, print APPROVED; otherwise, print DENIED.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5\n6 7 9 10 31\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nAPPROVED\n\nThe even numbers written on the document are 6 and 10.\nAll of them are divisible by 3 or 5, so the immigrant should be allowed entry.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
