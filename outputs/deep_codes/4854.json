He knows any cipher in the world can be broken by frequency analysis. He has completely the wrong idea what frequency analysis is, however.\n\nHe intercepted an enemy message. The message consists of $N$ numbers, smaller than or equal to $C$. Mirko belives freqency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent ones.\n\nFormally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers $X$ and $Y$, $X$ appears before $Y$ if the number of times $X$ appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time $Y$ does. If the number of appearances is equal, the number whose value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.\n\nHelp Mirko by creating a \u201cfrequency sorter\u201d.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of input contains two integers, $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1000$), the length of the message, and $C$ ($1 \\le C \\le 1000000000$), the number from the task description above.\n\nThe next line contains $N$ positive integers smaller than or equal to $C$, the message itself.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output should contain $N$ numbers, the sorted sequence.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 2\n2 1 2 1 2\nSample Output 1:\n2 2 2 1 1\n\nSample Input 2:\n9 3\n1 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1\nSample Output 2:\n1 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
