{"4012": {"code": ["def", "def", "def", "def", "def"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given three integers $a \\le b \\le c$.\n\nIn one move, you can add $+1$ or $-1$ to any of these integers (i.e. increase or decrease any number by one). You can perform such operation any (possibly, zero) number of times, you can even perform this operation several times with one number. Note that you cannot make non-positive numbers using such operations.\n\nYou have to perform the minimum number of such operations in order to obtain three integers $A \\le B \\le C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line as three space-separated integers $a, b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a \\le b \\le c \\le 10^4$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer. In the first line print $res$ \u2014 the minimum number of operations you have to perform to obtain three integers $A \\le B \\le C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$. On the second line print any suitable triple $A, B$ and $C$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n8\n1 2 3\n123 321 456\n5 10 15\n15 18 21\n100 100 101\n1 22 29\n3 19 38\n6 30 46\n\nOutput\n1\n1 1 3\n102\n114 228 456\n4\n4 8 16\n6\n18 18 18\n1\n100 100 100\n7\n1 22 22\n2\n1 19 38\n8\n6 24 48\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
