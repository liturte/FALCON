You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.\n\nA polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space \u2014 coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.\n\nJudge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1 1\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n\nInput\n0 10\n\nOutput\n0 1\n0 10\n0 0\n0 9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
