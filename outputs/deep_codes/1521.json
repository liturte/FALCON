For the i-th number x_{i}, DZY will put it into the bucket numbered h(x_{i}), where h(x) is the hash function. In this problem we will assume, that h(x) = x\u00a0mod\u00a0p. Operation a\u00a0mod\u00a0b denotes taking a remainder after division a by b.\n\nHowever, each bucket can contain no more than one element. If DZY wants to insert an number into a bucket which is already filled, we say a \"conflict\" happens. Suppose the first conflict happens right after the i-th insertion, you should output i. If no conflict happens, just output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers, p and n (2 \u2264 p, n \u2264 300). Then n lines follow. The i-th of them contains an integer x_{i} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 5\n0\n21\n53\n41\n53\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nOutput\n-1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
