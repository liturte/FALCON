{"2459": {"code": ["from", "n", "class", "def", "class"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given an array a of size n, and q queries to it. There are queries of two types:   1 l_{i} r_{i} \u2014 perform a cyclic shift of the segment [l_{i}, r_{i}] to the right. That is, for every x such that l_{i} \u2264 x < r_{i} new value of a_{x} + 1 becomes equal to old value of a_{x}, and new value of a_{l}_{i} becomes equal to old value of a_{r}_{i};  2 l_{i} r_{i} \u2014 reverse the segment [l_{i}, r_{i}].  \n\nThere are m important indices in the array b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. For each i such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m you have to output the number that will have index b_{i} in the array after all queries are performed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integer numbers n, q and m (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100). \n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9). \n\nThen q lines follow. i-th of them contains three integer numbers t_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i}, where t_{i} is the type of i-th query, and [l_{i}, r_{i}] is the segment where this query is performed (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n). \n\nThe last line contains m integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 important indices of the array. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint m numbers, i-th of which is equal to the number at index b_{i} after all queries are done.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6 3 5\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n2 1 3\n2 3 6\n1 1 6\n2 2 1 5 3\n\nOutput\n3 3 1 5 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
