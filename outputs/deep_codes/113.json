It then calculates the k-rounding of n by adding k multiples of 10 to n, dividing by n to get the correct number of trailing zeros, multiplying by n to get the correct value, and then rounding down to the nearest integer. The result is printed to the output.\n\nThe expression `(n+5*(10**k))//n*n` is equivalent to the mathematical formula for k-rounding. The expression `(n+5*(10**k))//n` calculates the number of trailing zeros in the k-rounding of n, and the expression `*n` scales this number back up to the correct value.", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint((n + 5 * 10**k - 1) // 10**k * 10**k)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn this solution, we use integer division (//) to perform the k-rounding. The expression `(n + 5 * 10**k - 1) // 10**k` calculates the smallest integer x such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n. The expression `x * 10**k` then calculates the k-rounding of n. This solution works by adding 5 to n and then dividing by 10**k, which ensures that the result ends with k or more zeros in base 10. The \"-1\" in the expression is used to ensure that the result is a", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint((n + 5 * 10**k - 1) // 10**k * 10**k)\n\n\nThis solution uses integer division (//) to perform the rounding. The expression (n + 5 * 10**k - 1) // 10**k rounds n up to the nearest multiple of 10**k. The expression n + 5 * 10**k ensures that the rounded number has k or more trailing zeros. The expression is subtracted by 1 and divided by 10**k to ensure that the rounded number is a multiple of 10**k.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be zero, then the solution should be modified to handle this case separately.\n\nAlso, please note that the solution assumes that k is", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint((n+10**k-1)//10**k*10**k)\n\n\nThis Python program reads two integers n and k from input, and prints the k-rounding of n. The k-rounding is computed as the smallest integer x such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n. This is done by adding k-1 zeros to n and then dividing by 10**k, rounding up to the nearest integer.\n\nThe operator `//` is used for integer division, and `%` is used for modulus operation. The parentheses are used for precedence.\n\nThe condition `n % 10**k == 0` checks if n is divisible by 10**k, and `n % 10**k !", "n, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint((n + 5 * 10**k - 1) // 10**k * 10**k)\n\n\nThe code works by first taking the input, then calculating the minimum x such that x ends with k or more zeros and is divisible by n. This is done by adding 5*10^k - 1 to n (which ensures that x is greater than n) and then dividing by 10^k. The result is then rounded down to the nearest integer using floor division. Finally, x is multiplied by 10^k to ensure that it ends with k or more zeros.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input n is always positive and that k is between 0 and 8. If n can be 0, then the input should be checked to ensure that it is not 0.
