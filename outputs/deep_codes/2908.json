This allows for fast lookup of the desired sum minus the current card. If such a card is found, it prints 'YES' and exits. If no such card is found after checking all cards, it prints 'NO'.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), as it needs to iterate over all the cards once. The space complexity is also", "def solve(n, s, cards):\n    values = set()\n    for card in cards:\n        if s - card in values:\n            return \"YES\"\n        values.add(card)\n    return \"NO\"\n\nn, s = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(solve(n, s, cards))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution works by using a set to store the values of the cards. For each card, it checks if the value that would be needed to reach the desired sum is already in the set. If it is, it returns \"YES\".

For each number in the array, it checks if the number is already in the set. If it is, that means we have found two numbers that add up to the target sum, so it returns 'YES'. If it gets through the entire array without finding a pair, it returns 'NO'. This solution works because the set lookup and insertion operations are on average O(1", "def solve():\n    n, s = map(int, input().split())\n    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    card_set = set(cards)\n    for card in cards:\n        if s - card in card_set:\n            return \"YES\"\n    return \"NO\"\n\nprint(solve())\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses a set to store the cards. It then iterates over each card, checking if the difference between the desired sum and the current card is in the set of cards. If it is, it returns \"YES\" because a pair of cards that add up to the desired sum has been found. If it iterates over all the cards without finding a pair, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of cards.

In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that add up to a given sum. However, to make things more interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below) means that certain cards will display different numbers if turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of the cards if necessary to generate the sum. Please help Simon win the game!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers, $n$, the number of cards, and $s$, the desired sum. The second line will contain $n$ integers between $1$ and $100000000$ inclusive. You may assume that $1\\leq n\\leq 100000$ and $2\\leq s\\leq 200000000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should be a single line consisting of the string YES if two cards can be chosen such that (in some orientation) they add up to $s$, and the string NO otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 66\n15 21 22\nSample Output:\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
