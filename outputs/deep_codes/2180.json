This can be done by placing Coders on the corners of the board. This is because a Coder can move to any of the adjacent cells, so it's better to place it as far from other Coders as possible. This way, we can place as many Coders as possible on the board.\n\nThe code first reads the input n, then prints n*n, which is the maximum number of Coders that can be placed on the board.

A Coder can move (and attack) one square horizontally or vertically. More precisely, if the Coder is located at position (x, y), he can move to (or attack) positions (x + 1, y), (x\u20131, y), (x, y + 1) and (x, y\u20131).\n\nIahub wants to know how many Coders can be placed on an n \u00d7 n chessboard, so that no Coder attacks any other Coder.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the first line print an integer, the maximum number of Coders that can be placed on the chessboard.\n\nOn each of the next n lines print n characters, describing the configuration of the Coders. For an empty cell print an '.', and for a Coder print a 'C'.\n\nIf there are multiple correct answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n2\nC.\n.C\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
