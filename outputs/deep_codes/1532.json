There can be more than one subset with the smallest imperfection and the same size, but you don't need to worry about it. Kate wants to find all the subsets herself, but she needs your help to find the smallest possible imperfection for each size $k$, will name it $I_k$. \n\nPlease, help Kate to find $I_2$, $I_3$, ..., $I_n$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line in the input consists of only one integer $n$ ($2\\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the size of the given set $S$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput contains only one line that includes $n - 1$ integers: $I_2$, $I_3$, ..., $I_n$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n1 \nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n1 1 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFirst sample: answer is 1, because $gcd(1, 2) = 1$.\n\nSecond sample: there are subsets of $S$ with sizes $2, 3$ with imperfection equal to 1.
