This may or may not be true, but this question is generally used to torture screen young computer science graduates during programming interviews. \n\nBasically, this is how it works: you print the integers from $1$ to $N$, replacing any of them divisible by $X$ with Fizz or, if they are divisible by $Y$, with Buzz. If the number is divisible by both $X$ and $Y$, you print FizzBuzz instead.\n\nCheck the samples for further clarification.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput contains a single test case. Each test case contains three integers on a single line, $X$, $Y$ and $N$ ($1 \\leq X < Y \\leq N \\leq 100$).\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint integers from $1$ to $N$ in order, each on its own line, replacing the ones divisible by $X$ with Fizz, the ones divisible by $Y$ with Buzz and ones divisible by both $X$ and $Y$ with FizzBuzz.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 3 7\nSample Output 1:\n1\nFizz\nBuzz\nFizz\n5\nFizzBuzz\n7\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 4 7\nSample Output 2:\n1\nFizz\n3\nFizzBuzz\n5\nFizz\n7\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
