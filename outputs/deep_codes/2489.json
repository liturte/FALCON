It then iteratively divides each number by its prime factors, and adds the counts to the counts of the resulting numbers. The counts of the numbers that cannot be divided by any of the prime numbers are then counted.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the prime numbers are known and hardcoded.

The space complexity is also O(N) because it stores the indices of the numbers in the list.\n\nThe function `solve()` takes two parameters: `n` (the length of the list) and `a` (the list of numbers). It returns the number of integers i (1 <= i <= N) with the given property.

It then counts the number of prime factors that occur N times, which are the numbers with the required property. The prime factors are found by dividing the numbers by their smallest prime factor until the number is prime. This is done using a while loop that continues as long as the number is divisible by the current divisor. If the number is not divisible by the divisor, the divisor is incremented. If the number is prime, it is added to the defaultdict.\n\nThe time", "from collections import defaultdict\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ndiv_count = defaultdict(int)\nfor i in range(N):\n    for j in range(2, int(A[i]**0.5)+1):\n        if A[i] % j == 0:\n            div_count[j] += 1\n            if A[i]//j != j:\n                div_count[A[i]//j] += 1\n\nres = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    if div_count[A[i]] == 0:\n        res += 1\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses a dictionary to count the number of divisors for each number in the sequence. It then checks each number in the sequence to see if it has any divisors. If a number has no divisors, it is a number with the desired property.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N*sqrt(max(A))), where N is the length of the sequence and max(A) is the maximum value in the sequence.
