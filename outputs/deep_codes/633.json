If there is no edge between some pair of vertices $v$ and $u$ then the value of $GCD(v, u)$ doesn't matter. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $|V|$.\n\nConstruct a relatively prime graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges such that it is connected and it contains neither self-loops nor multiple edges.\n\nIf there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output \"Impossible\".\n\nIf there are multiple answers then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output \"Impossible\".\n\nOtherwise print the answer in the following format:\n\nThe first line should contain the word \"Possible\".\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines should contain the $i$-th edge $(v_i, u_i)$ of the resulting graph ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n, v_i \\neq u_i$). For each pair $(v, u)$ there can be no more pairs $(v, u)$ or $(u, v)$. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nIf there are multiple answers then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6\n\nOutput\nPossible\n2 5\n3 2\n5 1\n3 4\n4 1\n5 4\n\nInput\n6 12\n\nOutput\nImpossible\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nHere is the representation of the graph from the first example: [Image]\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
