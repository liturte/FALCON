Each publication belongs to exactly one category. For each category $i$ batch algorithm selects $a_i$ publications.\n\nThe latest A/B test suggests that users are reading recommended publications more actively if each category has a different number of publications within daily recommendations. The targeted algorithm can find a single interesting publication of $i$-th category within $t_i$ seconds. \n\nWhat is the minimum total time necessary to add publications to the result of batch algorithm execution, so all categories have a different number of publications? You can't remove publications recommended by the batch algorithm.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input consists of single integer $n$\u00a0\u2014 the number of news categories ($1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$).\n\nThe second line of input consists of $n$ integers $a_i$\u00a0\u2014 the number of publications of $i$-th category selected by the batch algorithm ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\nThe third line of input consists of $n$ integers $t_i$\u00a0\u2014 time it takes for targeted algorithm to find one new publication of category $i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^5)$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal required time for the targeted algorithm to get rid of categories with the same size.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n3 7 9 7 8\n5 2 5 7 5\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, it is possible to find three publications of the second type, which will take 6 seconds.\n\nIn the second example, all news categories contain a different number of publications.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
