{"4500": {"code": ["A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B >= C else 'No')\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis code reads the values of A, B, and C from the input. It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C. If it is, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis is a simple comparison problem, which can be solved with a single line of code. The `map` function is used to read the input as integers, and the `input().split()` function is used to split the input into separate values. The `print` function is then used to output the result.\n\nThe condition `A + B >= C` checks if Takahashi has enough money to buy the toy. If he does, 'Yes' is printed. If he doesn't, 'No' is printed.\n\nThis code does not include any error checking or input validation, so it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format.", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B >= C else 'No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code reads the input values of A, B, and C. It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C. If it is, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nThis is a simple solution to the problem. It assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for any other potential errors.\n\nThe \"map\" function is used to convert the input string into integers. The \"split\" function is used to split the input string into a list of strings, based on the space character. The \">=\" operator is used to compare the sum of A and B with C. The \"print\" function is used to print the result.\n\nThe code uses the ternary operator \"x if condition else y\" which is a compact way to write an if-else statement. It is equivalent to the following code:\n\n\nif A + B >= C:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n\n\nprint('No')", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B >= C:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Then it checks if the sum of A and B is greater or equal to C. If it is, it prints \"Yes\", otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nIn the given example, A + B = 50 + 100 = 150, which is greater than C = 120, so the program prints \"Yes\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will be in the correct format as described in the problem statement.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this solution is written in Python, but it can be translated to any other programming language with minor changes.\n\n\nA, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nif A + B >= C:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n\n\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n\n\n\nA, B, C = map(int, input().", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint('Yes' if A + B >= C else 'No')\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program reads three integers from the standard input, which represent the values of A, B, and C. It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C. If the sum is greater than or equal to C, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.\n\nThis solution is straightforward and does not require any explanations or comments.\n\nThis program is written in Python and uses the ternary operator to simplify the if-else statement. It's a compact way to write the same logic.\n\nThe `map` function is used to apply the `int` function to each element of the input, which turns them into integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input by spaces, and `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis program is a direct translation of the problem statement into Python code.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(1), which means it always executes in the same amount of time, regardless of the input size", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(\"Yes\" if A + B >= C else \"No\")\n\n\nThis code reads the input values for A, B, and C, then uses a conditional expression to print \"Yes\" if A + B is greater than or equal to C, otherwise it prints \"No\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the coins A and B are always available for purchase, and the cost of the toy C is always known. It does not consider any possible variations in currency or varying availability of coins.\n\nAlso, the code does not handle any exceptions or errors that may arise from the input. If the input format is not as expected, the code may fail. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add error handling to account for such potential issues."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAn elementary school student Takahashi has come to a variety store.\nHe has two coins, A-yen and B-yen coins (yen is the currency of Japan), and wants to buy a toy that costs C yen.
