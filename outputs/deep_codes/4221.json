If the string does not end with 's', it appends 's' to the end of the string.

It then checks if the last character of `S` is 's'. If it is, it appends 'es' to the end of `S`. If it is not, it appends 's' to the end of `S`. The result is the plural form of the noun in Taknese language.\n\nThis is done by using Python's string slicing and concatenation capabilities. The `[-1]` index is used to get the last character of the string, and the `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. The `print` function is used to output the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string `S` is always in lowercase English letters as per the constraints."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn the Kingdom of AtCoder, people use a language called Taknese, which uses lowercase English letters.\nIn Taknese, the plural form of a noun is spelled based on the following rules:\n - If a noun's singular form does not end with s, append s to the end of the singular form.\n - If a noun's singular form ends with s, append es to the end of the singular form.\nYou are given the singular form S of a Taknese noun. Output its plural form.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is a string of length 1 between 1000, inclusive.\n - S contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the plural form of the given Taknese word.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\napple\n\n-----Sample Output-----\napples\n\napple ends with e, so its plural form is apples.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
