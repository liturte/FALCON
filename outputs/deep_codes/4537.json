The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings. The `int` function is used to convert each string to an integer. The `map` and `int` functions are combined with the `input().split()` function to convert the input string to two integers.\n\nThe `print` function is used to print the maximum value.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(1) because it does a constant number of operations.
