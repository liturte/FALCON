If it's impossible, it returns -1. If it's possible, it calculates the maximum number of sets by dividing the total score by the points per game.

If the total points are greater than or equal to k, it calculates the maximum number of sets that can be played by dividing the total points by k and returning the result. The \"//\" operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and gives the largest whole number of sets that can be played.", "import sys\n\ndef solve(k, a, b):\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    if a < k:\n        return -1\n    return a // k\n\nk, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nprint(solve(k, a, b))\n\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that if Misha scored more than k points, then he could have won a set. Therefore, to find the maximum number of sets, we need to divide the total number of points scored by the number of points needed to win a set. If the total number of points scored is less than the number of points needed to win a set, then it is impossible to win", "def max_sets():\n    k, a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if a + b < k:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return (a + b) // k\n\nprint(max_sets())\n\n\nThis code works by taking in the inputs for k, a, and b, and checking if the total score of both players is less than k. If it is, it returns -1 as the situation is impossible. If it's not, it calculates the maximum number of sets they could have played by dividing the total score by k and returning that value. This is done using integer division (//), which truncates the result to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt's worth noting that this code assumes that"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nMisha and Vanya have played several table tennis sets. Each set consists of several serves, each serve is won by one of the players, he receives one point and the loser receives nothing. Once one of the players scores exactly k points, the score is reset and a new set begins.\n\nAcross all the sets Misha scored a points in total, and Vanya scored b points. Given this information, determine the maximum number of sets they could have played, or that the situation is impossible.\n\nNote that the game consisted of several complete sets.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers k, a and b (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^9, a + b > 0).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the situation is impossible, print a single number -1. Otherwise, print the maximum possible number of sets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11 11 5\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n11 2 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote that the rules of the game in this problem differ from the real table tennis game, for example, the rule of \"balance\" (the winning player has to be at least two points ahead to win a set) has no power within the present problem.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
