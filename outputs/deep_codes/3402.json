Then, he chooses $26$ non-empty strings $T_ a, T_ b, \\dots , T_ z$, each consisting of at least two lowercase English letters. He defines a function $f$, which converts each character $i$ to its corresponding string $T_ i$ and concatenates the results. For example, if $T_ a$ was \u201cabc\u201d and $T_ b$ was \u201ccba\u201d, applying $f$ to \u201caba\u201d would result in the string \u201cabccbaabc\u201d.\n\nNow, he applies $f$ repeatedly to $S$, applying it $K$ times in total.
