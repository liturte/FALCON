This time Joker has given an open challenge to solve the following problem in order to save Gotham. Help Batman in protecting Gotham by solving the problem.\nYou are given two strings A and B composed of lowercase letters of Latin alphabet. B can be obtained by removing some characters from A(including 0). You are given an array containing any random permutation of numbers $1$ to $N$, where $N$ is the length of the string A. You have to remove the letters of A in the given order of indices. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters do not change. Return the maximum number of indices you can remove in the given order such that B is still obtainable from A.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First two lines contains the strings A and B respectively.\n- The third line contains a random permutation of numbers from $1$ to $N$ representing some order of indices of string A.\n\n-----Output:-----\nPrint a single number denoting the maximum number of indices you can remove in the given order such that B is still obtainable from A.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq |B| \\leq |A| \\leq 200000$\n\n-----Sample Input #1:-----\nxxyxxy\nxyy\n1 5 4 6 3 2\n\n-----Sample Output #1:-----\n3\n\n-----Sample Input #2:-----\njphokenixr\njoker\n2 9 3 7 8 1 6 5 4 10\n\n-----Sample Output #2:-----\n5\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nFor the first example removing characters in order,\nxxyxxy => _xyxxy => _xyx_y => _xy__y.\nIf we remove any other element now then we can not obtain 'xxy'. So the ans is 3.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
