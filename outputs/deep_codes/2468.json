It starts with a -1 as the initial position in the stack, which is used for the first ')' in the string. It then iterates through the string, adding the position to the stack when it encounters a '(', and removing the last item from the stack when it encounters a ')'. If the stack is not empty after the removal, it means that the parentheses at the top of the stack and the current position are valid. The maximum length is then updated by taking the maximum of the current maximum length and the difference between the current position and the top of the stack. If the stack is empty after the removal, it means that the current position is the start", "class Solution:\n    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:\n        max_len = 0\n        stack = [-1]\n        \n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '(':\n                stack.append(i)\n            else:\n                stack.pop()\n                if len(stack) != 0:\n                    max_len = max(max_len, i - stack[-1])\n                else:\n                    stack.append(i)\n        return max_len\n\n\nThe solution uses a stack to keep track of the positions of the parentheses. When it encounters a '(', it pushes the index into the stack. When it encounters a ')', it pops the top element of the stack and calculates the length of the longest valid parentheses substring. If the stack becomes empty, it pushes the current index into the stack. The maximum length is updated whenever a longer valid substring is found.\n\nThis solution works because it processes the string from left to right. When it encounters a ')', it knows that the corresponding '(' must be to its left, so it can calculate the length of the longest valid parentheses substring ending at this position.
