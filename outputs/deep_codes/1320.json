They love Famil Door so they are planning to make his birthday cake weird!\n\nThe cake is a n \u00d7 n square consisting of equal squares with side length 1. Each square is either empty or consists of a single chocolate. They bought the cake and randomly started to put the chocolates on the cake. The value of Famil Door's happiness will be equal to the number of pairs of cells with chocolates that are in the same row or in the same column of the cake. Famil Doors's family is wondering what is the amount of happiness of Famil going to be?\n\nPlease, note that any pair can be counted no more than once, as two different cells can't share both the same row and the same column.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn the first line of the input, you are given a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the side of the cake.\n\nThen follow n lines, each containing n characters. Empty cells are denoted with '.', while cells that contain chocolates are denoted by 'C'.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the value of Famil Door's happiness, i.e. the number of pairs of chocolate pieces that share the same row or the same column.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n.CC\nC..\nC.C\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\nCC..\nC..C\n.CC.\n.CC.\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIf we number rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right, then, pieces that share the same row in the first sample are:   (1, 2) and (1, 3)  (3, 1) and (3, 3)  Pieces that share the same column are:   (2, 1) and (3, 1)  (1, 3) and (3, 3)\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
