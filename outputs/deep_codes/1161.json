There are two types of brackets: opening and closing. You can replace any bracket by another of the same type. For example, you can replace < by the bracket {, but you can't replace it by ) or >.\n\nThe following definition of a regular bracket sequence is well-known, so you can be familiar with it.\n\nLet's define a regular bracket sequence (RBS). Empty string is RBS. Let s_1 and s_2 be a RBS then the strings <s_1>s_2, {s_1}s_2, [s_1]s_2, (s_1)s_2 are also RBS.\n\nFor example the string \"[[(){}]<>]\" is RBS, but the strings \"[)()\" and \"][()()\" are not.\n\nDetermine the least number of replaces to make the string s RBS.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a non empty string s, consisting of only opening and closing brackets of four kinds. The length of s does not exceed 10^6.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it's impossible to get RBS from s print Impossible.\n\nOtherwise print the least number of replaces needed to get RBS from s.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n[<}){}\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n{()}[]\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n]]\n\nOutput\nImpossible\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
