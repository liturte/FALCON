If he doesn\u2019t get there in time, Donald might show up and take his place instead. \n\nDuckburg has recently started providing a very eco-friendly way of public transport: bikes. At many bike stations throughout the city, one can pick up a free bike, ride it to another bike station, and drop it there. This gives Gladstone two ways of transportion: on foot or by bike. Biking is faster, of course, but he must pick up and leave the bikes at the designated stations. Gladstone can walk or bike between any two points in a straight line.\n\nGladstone possesses a map of the (rectangular) center of Duckburg. His current position is on this map and so is the meeting point with Daisy. The map also contains the locations of all bike stations within the boundaries of the map.\n\nThere can be way more bike stations though, that are not within the boundaries of the map. Considering his luck, you can assume that the moment Gladstone walks (or bikes) off the map, he encounters a bike station if that suits him well. The bike stations not on the map can be located anywhere outside the map, they do not have to lie on integer coordinates.\n\nThat leaves Gladstone with the task of figuring out which route to take.
