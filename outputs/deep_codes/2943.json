Looking at the data, Professor Rogers wants to know which part of Linearland had the \u201cleast\u201d purple rain.\n\nAfter some thought, he decides to model this problem as follows. Divide the peninsula into $n$ sections and number them West to East from $1$ to $n$. Then, describe the raindrops as a sequence of R and B, depending on whether the rainfall in each section is primarily red or blue. Finally, find a subsequence of where the difference between the number of R and the number of B is maximized.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing a string of $n$ characters ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), describing the color of the raindrops in sections $1$ to $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the string consists of uppercase ASCII letters \u2018R\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 only.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint, on a single line, two space-separated integers that describe the starting and ending positions of the part of Linearland that had the least purple rain.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, print the one that has the Westernmost (smallest-numbered) starting section. If there are multiple answers with the same Westernmost starting section, print the one with the Westernmost ending section.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nBBRRBRRBRB\nSample Output:\n3 7\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
