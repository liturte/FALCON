He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 \u2264 x, y, z \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print \"Yes\". Otherwise, print \"No\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 4 0\n2 1 2\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n5 6 1\n2 7 2\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n3 3 3\n2 2 2\n\nOutput\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
