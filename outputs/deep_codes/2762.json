The sequence of $N$ positions will be divided into $G$ segments of consecutive positions where every position belongs to exactly one segment and each segment is managed by exactly one builder.\n\nGiven an integer $G$ ($1 \\leq G \\leq N$), your task is to identify a way to allocate jobs to $G$ builders to minimize their total building costs.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line contains $3$ integers $N$, $G$, $k$ $(1 \\leq N \\leq 2000, \\; 1 \\leq G \\leq N, \\; 1 \\leq k \\leq 2)$.\n - The second line contains $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ N$$(1 \\leq a_ i \\leq 10^6, \\; a_ i \\leq a_{i+1} \\; \\forall \\; 0<i<N)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum building cost required.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 1 1\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 1 2\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 2:\n10\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
