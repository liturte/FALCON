When the dart hits section $i$ the player scores $i$ points. Each section also contains a double area and a triple area. When the dart hits the double area of section $i$ the player scores $2 i$ points, and when the dart hits the triple area the player scores $3 i$ points, instead of $i$ points. When throwing three darts, the player can therefore score a total of at most $180$ points by throwing all three darts in the triple area of section $20$. \n\nGiven a target score, output at most three throw scores such that their sum is equal to the given target score. Note that the centre of the dartboard, which is usually called bullseye, is not taken into account is this problem.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n \\leq 180$), the target score.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the target score can be achieved, output at most three lines, each of the form \u201csingle $d$\u201d, \u201cdouble $d$\u201d, or \u201ctriple $d$\u201d, where $d$ is an integer between $1$ and $20$ (inclusive), such that the sum of these scores is equal to $n$. Otherwise, output \u201cimpossible\u201d. If there are multiple valid answers you may output any of them.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n180\nSample Output 1:\ntriple 20\ntriple 20\ntriple 20\n\nSample Input 2:\n96\nSample Output 2:\ntriple 19\ndouble 15\nsingle 9\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
