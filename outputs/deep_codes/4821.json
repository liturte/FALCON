For simplicity\u2019s sake, we can assume that all cards have a suit and a number.\n\nThe suit of the card is one of the characters P, K, H, T, and the number of the card is an integer between $1$ and $13$. The robot labels each card in the format $TXY$ where $T$ is the suit and $XY$ is the number. If the card\u2019s number consists of one digit, then $X = 0$. For example, the card of suit P and number $9$ is labelled P09.\n\nA complete deck has $52$ cards in total\u2014for each of the four suits there is exactly one card with a number between $1$ and $13$.\n\nThe robot has read the labels of all the cards in the deck and combined them into the string $S$. Help Pero finish the robot by writing a programme that reads the string made out of card labels and outputs how many cards are missing for each suit. If there are two exact same cards in the deck, output GRESKA (Croatian for ERROR).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input contains the string $S$ ($1 \\leq \\left|S\\right| \\leq 1\\ 000$), containing all the card labels.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there are two exact same cards in the deck, output \u201cGRESKA\u201d. Otherwise, the first and only line of output must consist of 4 space-separated numbers: how many cards of the suit P, K, H, T are missing, respectively.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nP01K02H03H04\nSample Output 1:\n12 12 11 13\n\nSample Input 2:\nH02H10P11H02\nSample Output 2:\nGRESKA\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
