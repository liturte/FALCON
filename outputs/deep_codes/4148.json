The ord function is used to convert each character to its ASCII value, and the result is shifted by n, with the modulus operator used to wrap around at Z (i.e., Z+1 is A). The resulting ASCII value is then converted back to a character using the chr function. The join function is used to concatenate all the shifted characters into a single string.\n\nThe code then reads the integer n and string s from the standard input, and prints the result of calling shift_characters with s and n.\n\nNote that the ASCII values for uppercase English", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\nans = \"\"\nfor c in S:\n    ans += chr((ord(c) - ord('A') + N) % 26 + ord('A'))\nprint(ans)\n\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in ord() function, which returns the Unicode code point for a given string, and chr() function, which returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer. The ord('A') is subtracted from the Unicode code point of each character in S to shift the character to a range of 0-25, then N is added to shift the character by N places. The modulo operator (%) is used to wrap the result back into the 0-25 range. Finally, the ord('A') is added back to shift the result back into the Unicode code point range of uppercase English letters.\n\nThe resulting string is stored in the variable ans and printed at the end.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of S, since it iterates over S once.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nSolution:\n\nN = int(input())", "n = int(input())\ns = input()\nresult = ''\nfor c in s:\n    result += chr((ord(c) - ord('A') + n) % 26 + ord('A'))\nprint(result)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads an integer n and a string s from the standard input. Then it iterates over each character in the string, shifts it by n positions in the alphabet, and adds the result to a new string, which is then printed. The shift is done using the modulo operation to wrap around at the end of the alphabet. The ord function is used to convert the character to its ASCII value, and the chr function is used to convert the ASCII value back to a character.\n\nPlease note that the ord('A') is subtracted from the ASCII value of the character to convert it to a number in the range 0-25 (since A-Z correspond to 0-25 in the alphabet), and then n is added. The modulo operation is used to wrap around at the end of the alphabet, and finally the result is converted back to a character using chr.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string consists of upper", "N = int(input())\nS = input()\n\nresult = \"\"\nfor c in S:\n    shift = ord(c) - ord('A') + N\n    result += chr(ord('A') + shift % 26)\n\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis Python program works by first reading the shift value `N` and the string `S` from input. It then initializes an empty string `result` to store the resulting string.\n\nThe program then iterates over each character `c` in `S`. For each character, it calculates the new position by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of `c` (to get a value in the range 0-25), adding `N`, and then taking the remainder when divided by 26 (to wrap around to the start of the alphabet if necessary). It then converts this new position back to a character using `chr` and adds it to the `result` string.\n\nFinally, the program prints the `result` string.\n\nThis program assumes that the string `S` consists of uppercase English letters, as specified in the problem constraints. If `S` contains other characters,", "n = int(input())\ns = input()\nresult = \"\"\nfor c in s:\n    result += chr((ord(c) - ord('A') + n) % 26 + ord('A'))\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each character in the input string `s`. The `ord()` function is used to convert the character to its ASCII representation, and then subtracts the ASCII representation of 'A' to get a 0-25 range. Then add `n` to it and take the modulus 26 to make sure the result is within the range 0-25. Finally, it converts the result back to its ASCII representation by adding the ASCII representation of 'A', and the `chr()` function is used to convert the ASCII representation back to a character. The resulting character is then appended to the `result` string, which is finally printed.\n\nThe modulus operation ensures that if the result is greater than 25, it wraps around to the start of the alphabet. For example, 'Y' shifted by 3 becomes 'B'.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters.
