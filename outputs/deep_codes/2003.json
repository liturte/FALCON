There are three types of queries:  \"+ x\"\u00a0\u2014 add integer x to multiset A. \"- x\"\u00a0\u2014 erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query. \"? x\"\u00a0\u2014 you are given integer x and need to compute the value $\\operatorname{max}_{y \\in A}(x \\oplus y)$, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.\n\nMultiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.\n\nEach of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer x_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.\n\nNote, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query of the type '?' print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer x_{i} and some integer from the multiset A.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n10\n+ 8\n+ 9\n+ 11\n+ 6\n+ 1\n? 3\n- 8\n? 3\n? 8\n? 11\n\nOutput\n11\n10\n14\n13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nAfter first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.\n\nThe answer for the sixth query is integer $11 = 3 \\oplus 8$\u00a0\u2014 maximum among integers $3 \\oplus 0 = 3$, $3 \\oplus 9 = 10$, $3 \\oplus 11 = 8$, $3 \\oplus 6 = 5$ and $3 \\oplus 1 = 2$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
