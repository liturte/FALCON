They are called Antenna A, B, C, D and E from west to east, and their coordinates are a, b, c, d and e, respectively.\n\nTwo antennas can communicate directly if the distance between them is k or less, and they cannot if the distance is greater than k.\n\nDetermine if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly.\n\nHere, assume that the distance between two antennas at coordinates p and q (p < q) is q - p.  \n\n-----Constraints-----\n - a, b, c, d, e and k are integers between 0 and 123 (inclusive).\n - a < b < c < d < e\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nk\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint :( if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, and print Yay! if there is no such pair.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n2\n4\n8\n9\n15\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYay!\n\nIn this case, there is no pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, because:\n - the distance between A and B is 2 - 1 = 1\n - the distance between A and C is 4 - 1 = 3\n - the distance between A and D is 8 - 1 = 7\n - the distance between A and E is 9 - 1 = 8\n - the distance between B and C is 4 - 2 = 2\n - the distance between B and D is 8 - 2 = 6\n - the distance between B and E is 9 - 2 = 7\n - the distance between C and D is 8 - 4 = 4\n - the distance between C and E is 9 - 4 = 5\n - the distance between D and E is 9 - 8 = 1\nand none of them is greater than 15. Thus, the correct output is Yay!.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
