Then a new customer bought this $3$-ryo shuriken. After this she added a $1$-ryo shuriken. Finally, the last two customers bought shurikens $1$ and $4$, respectively. Note that the order $[2, 4, 3, 1]$ is also valid.\n\nIn the second example the first customer bought a shuriken before anything was placed, which is clearly impossible.\n\nIn the third example Tenten put all her shurikens onto the showcase, after which a customer came in and bought a shuriken with price $2$. This is impossible since the shuriken was not the cheapest, we know that the $1$-ryo shuriken was also there.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
