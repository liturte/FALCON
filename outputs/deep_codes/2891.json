The underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are equally likely (which isn\u2019t quite true), the year has exactly $365$ days (which also isn\u2019t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this problem, we\u2019ll accept these assumptions.\n\nConsider what we might observe if we randomly select groups of $P=10$ people. Once we have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on shared birthdays. Among many other possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of shared birthdays:\n - all $10$ have different birthdays, or\n - all $10$ have the same birthday, or\n - $3$ people have the same birthday, $2$ other people have the same birthday (on a different day), and the remaining $5$ all have different birthdays.\n\nOf course, these distributions have different probabilities of occurring.\n\nYour job is to calculate this probability for a given distribution of people sharing birthdays. That is, if there are $P$ people in a group, how probable is the given distribution of shared birthdays (among all possible distributions for $P$ people chosen uniformly at random)?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line gives a number $n$ where $1 \\le n \\le 365$.

The value $c_ i$ represents the number of people who share a certain birthday (and whose birthday is distinct from the birthdays of everyone else in the group).\n\n-----Output-----\nCompute the probability $b$ of observing a group of people with the given distribution of shared birthdays. Since $b$ may be quite small, output instead $\\log _{10}(b)$. Your submission\u2019s answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$ from the judge\u2019s answer.\n\n-----Explanations-----\nThe first sample case shows $P=2$ people with distinct birthdays.
