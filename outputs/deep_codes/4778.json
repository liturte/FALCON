A precinct is an indivisible group of voters. The votes for all precincts in a district are added together to find the results for that district. In this problem you are given a description of a number of precincts: the party vote totals for each precinct, and how those precincts have been grouped into districts. For each district, determine the party that wins and the wasted votes for each party. Then determine the efficiency gap between the two parties over all the districts.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input describes one election. The first line contains two integers $P$ and $D$, where $1 \\le P \\le 10000$ and $1 \\le D \\le \\min (1000, P)$. These indicate, respectively, the number of voting precincts and districts. Following this are $P$ lines describing the precincts. Line $i$ contains $3$ numbers: the district $d_ i$ that precinct $i$ is assigned to ($1 \\le d_ i \\le D$), the number of votes for the candidate from party A ($0 \\le a_ i \\le 100000$), and the number of votes for the candidate from party B ($0 \\le b_ i \\le 100000$). It is guaranteed that:\n - for each precinct $i$, $0 < a_ i + b_ i$,\n - each district is assigned at least one precinct, and\n - there are no ties within any district.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each of the districts from $1$ to $D$, print which party wins (a single character, either A or B). Then print the number of wasted votes for party A and for party B, in order. Finally, after reporting on all the districts, print the efficiency gap as measured over all the districts. The efficiency gap should be accurate to within an absolute error of $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 3\n1 100 200\n2 100 99\n3 100 50\n3 100 50\n2 100 98\nSample Output 1:\nB 100 49\nA 1 197\nA 49 100\n0.1965897693\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n3 100 99\n2 100 99\n1 100 99\n4 100 99\nSample Output 2:\nA 0 99\nA 0 99\nA 0 99\nA 0 99\n0.4974874372\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
