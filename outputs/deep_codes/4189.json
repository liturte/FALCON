It then uses a list comprehension to count the number of soft cheeses, and prints the result.\n\nNote that the `input().split()` function is used to read the name and type of each cheese from the input, splitting the line into a list of two elements. The `[1]` index is used to access the type of each cheese.\n\nThe `len()` function is used to count the number of elements in the list of soft cheeses, which is the number of soft cheeses.\n\nThe `cheese_count` function is defined to encapsulate this functionality, allowing it to be reused in other parts of the program if necessary.\n\nThe `input()`", "def count_cheeses(n):\n    return n - 3\n\nn = int(input())\ncheeses = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]\nprint(count_cheeses(n))\n\n\nThis solution assumes that the three types of cheeses are 'soft', 'hard' and 'semi-soft'. It subtracts these types from the total number of cheeses to get the number of 'hard' cheeses.\n\nPlease note that this solution may not work correctly for all cases, as the problem statement is not clear about the definition of 'semi-soft' cheese. It's assumed that 'semi-soft' is not a type of cheese. If 'semi-soft' is indeed a type of cheese, we need to count it as well.\n\nIf you provide more context or examples, I can provide a more accurate solution.", "def solve():\n    N = int(input())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(N):\n        name, type = input().split()\n        if type == 'hard':\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\nsolve()\n\n\nThis solution works by first reading the number of cheeses from the input.

Finally, it returns the count of hard cheeses.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of cheeses.\n\nThe space complexity of this code is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count of hard cheeses and the inputs.\n\nThis code works for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.\n\nThis code assumes that the input format is correct and does not handle any potential errors or exceptions that might occur if the input format is incorrect.\n\nThis code is written in Python.", "def solve(n, cheeses):\n    return sum(t == 'soft' for _, t in cheeses)\n\nn = int(input())\ncheeses = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]\nprint(solve(n, cheeses))\n\n\nThis code reads the number of cheeses and the list of cheeses from the input, and then uses the solve function to count the number of soft cheeses.
