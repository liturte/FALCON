The state dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to choose j books from the first i books. The transition from state dp[i-1][j] means not choosing the i-th book, and from state dp[i-1][j-1]*a[i-1] means choosing the i-th book.

It initializes a list `dp` of size `k+1` with all elements as `0`. The first element of the list `dp` is set as `1` because there is `1` way to get a sum of `0` (by not selecting any elements). Then it iterates over the range `1` to `n+1` (inclusive) and for each `i`, it copies the list `dp` to `dp2`. It then iterates over the range `a[i-1]` to `k+1` (inclusive) and updates the `j`th element of `", "from collections import deque\n\ndef book_reader(n, k, books):\n    book_counts = [0] * n\n    book_queue = deque(maxlen=k)\n\n    for book in books:\n        book_counts[book - 1] += 1\n        book_queue.append(book - 1)\n        if len(book_queue) == k:\n            for book in book_queue:\n                book_counts[book] -= 1\n\n    return book_counts.index(max(book_counts)) + 1\n\nprint(book_reader(4, 100, [1, 2, 2, 1]))\nprint(book_reader(4, 1, [1, 2, 2, 1]))\nprint(book_reader(4, 2, [1, 2, 3, 1]))\n\n\nThis code uses a deque to keep track of the last k books read.
