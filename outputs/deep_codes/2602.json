Then:  The first guest eats a chocolate cookie. After that, there are $2$ vanilla cookies and $1$ chocolate cookie.  The second guest eats a chocolate cookie. After that, there are $2$ vanilla cookies and $0$ chocolate cookies.  The last guest selects a chocolate cookie, but there are no chocolate cookies. So, the guest gets angry. \n\nSo, this order can't be chosen by Anna.\n\nLet's consider the order $\\{2, 2, 1\\}$ of types of guests. Then:  The first guest eats a vanilla cookie. After that, there is $1$ vanilla cookie and $2$ chocolate cookies.  The second guest eats a vanilla cookie. After that, there are $0$ vanilla cookies and $2$ chocolate cookies.  The last guest eats a chocolate cookie. After that, there are $0$ vanilla cookies and $1$ chocolate cookie. \n\nSo, the answer to this test case is \"Yes\".\n\nIn the fifth test case, it is illustrated, that the number of cookies ($a + b$) can be equal to zero, but the number of guests ($n + m$) can't be equal to zero.\n\nIn the sixth test case, be careful about the overflow of $32$-bit integer type.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
