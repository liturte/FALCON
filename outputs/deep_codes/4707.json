It's a straightforward solution to the problem.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"101\", the code will output \"2\" because there are 2 '1's in the input string.\n\nNote: The count method is a built-in function in Python that counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. In this case, it's used to count the number of '1's in the input string.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Answer\nprint(input().count('1'))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe `input()` function reads a line from input (usually from the user), converts it into a string, and returns that string. The `count()` method counts how many times a specific value (in this case, '1') appears in the string. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"101\", the output will be \"2\".\n\"\"\"\n\n# Answer\nprint(input().count('1'))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe `input()` function reads a line from input", "s = input()\nprint(s.count('1'))\n\n\nThis program reads a string of 1s and 0s from the standard input, counts the number of 1s in it, and prints the count.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `count` method of a string returns the number of occurrences of a specified value. In this case, we're counting the number of 1s in the input string, which corresponds to the number of squares on which Snuke will place a marble.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always a string of exactly three characters, as specified in the problem constraints. If the input could be longer or shorter, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nNote: This solution uses Python's built-in `count` method of strings, which is a very efficient way to solve this problem.\n\n\ns = input()\nprint(s.count('1'))\n\n\nThis code reads a string from the standard input, counts the number of 1s in it, and prints the count. It's a very efficient solution because Python's `count` method is implemented in C, which is much faster than any other Python code could be.\n\nIn summary, this program counts the number of 1s in a string of 1s and 0s, which corresponds to the number of squares on which Snu"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke has a grid consisting of three squares numbered 1, 2 and 3.\nIn each square, either 0 or 1 is written.
