{"4403": {"code": ["S = input()\nprint(S.count('+') - S.count('-'))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is a straightforward application of the problem statement. We count the number of '+' and '-' symbols in the input string S, and subtract the number of '-' symbols from the number of '+' symbols. This gives us the final integer in Takahashi's mind.\n\"\"\"\n\nS = input()\nprint(S.count('+') - S.count", "print(sum(1 if s == '+' else -1 for s in input()))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem is asking to sum up the number of '+' and '-' in the input string. The number of '+' will increase the number in Takahashi's mind, and the number of '-' will decrease the number in his mind. The final number is the sum of these operations. The sum function is used to sum up the values of the expression, and it's a", "print(sum(1 if s == '+' else -1 for s in input()))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code reads a string of symbols from the standard input, and for each symbol it checks if it's a + or -. If it's a +, it adds 1 to the sum, and if it's a -, it subtracts 1 from the sum. The result is the final value of the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols", "S = input()\nprint(S.count('+') - S.count('-'))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe code above counts the number of '+' symbols and the number of '-' symbols in the input string S. The integer in Takahashi's mind is the difference between the number of '+' symbols and the number of '-' symbols.\n\"\"\"\n\n# S = input()\n# print(S.count('+') - S.count('-'))\n\n\"\"\"", "print(sum(1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in input()))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution is a one-liner Python code that uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string, converting '+' to 1 and '-' to -1, and then summing these values to find the final integer in Takahashi's mind. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nNOTE: The input() function is used to read a line"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere is always an integer in Takahashi's mind.\nInitially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0. Takahashi is now going to eat four symbols, each of which is + or -. When he eats +, the integer in his mind increases by 1; when he eats -, the integer in his mind decreases by 1.\nThe symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string S. The i-th character in S is the i-th symbol for him to eat.\nFind the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - The length of S is 4.\n - Each character in S is + or -.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n+-++\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\n - Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0.\n - The first integer for him to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.\n - The second integer to eat is -. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 0.\n - The third integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.\n - The fourth integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 2.\nThus, the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols is 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
