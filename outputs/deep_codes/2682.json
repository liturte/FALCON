Therefore, we have a deck with 8 cards.\nThe shuffling is done in three steps:\n\nStep 0: We divide {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} in 20 decks. We get only one deck.\nThe deck is reordered into {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nStep 1: We divide {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7} in 21 decks. We get two decks: {0, 2, 4, 6} and {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n{0, 2, 4, 6} is reordered into {0, 4, 2, 6} while {1, 3, 5, 7} is reordered into {1, 5, 3, 7}.\nWe get {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} when we put the decks back together.\n\nStep 2: We divide {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} in 22 decks. We get four decks: {0, 4}, {2, 6}, {1, 5} and {3, 7}.\nEach one of the four decks stays the same after it is reordered (as there are only two elements to reorder).\nWe get the final, shuffled deck: {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7}.\n\nThe card labelled 4 is on position 1.\nThe card labelled 3 is on position 6.\nThe card labelled 2 is on position 2.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
