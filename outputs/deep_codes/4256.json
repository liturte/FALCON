This gives the maximum number of times Takahashi can hear his favorite sound without going over his budget or being satisfied.\n\nThis is because B divided by A gives the maximum number of times he can hear the sound without spending more than his budget, and C gives the maximum number of times he can be satisfied. The minimum of these two values is the maximum number of times he can hear the sound without going over his budget or being satisfied.\n\nThis is a simple mathematical problem that can be solved with a few lines of code.", "A, B, C = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(B // A, C))\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the user input and splitting it into three variables. Then it prints the minimum value between the result of the division of B by A and C. This is because Takahashi can hear the sound as many times as he can with his money (B divided by A), but he will be satisfied at most C times.\n\nIn the sample input 2 11 4, the result of B divided by A is 5, which means Takahashi can buy 5 drinks. The minimum between 5 and 4 is 4, so the output will be 4.\n\nThis solution assumes that Takahashi will always have enough money to buy at least one drink. If he can have 0 yen, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution also assumes that Takahashi will not be able to buy more drinks than he is allowed to be satisfied with.

This is because Takahashi can't hear the sound more than C times.\n\nThis code is efficient because it uses the built-in min function to find the minimum of B divided by A and C, which takes constant time.\n\nThis code also follows the constraints of the problem, as A, B, and C are all integers between 1 and 100.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(1), which means it runs in constant time, regardless of the input size.
