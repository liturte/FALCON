This is done by converting the number to binary, counting the number of 1s and the length of the binary string. If the number of 1s is 2 less than the length of the binary", "def largest_beautiful_divisor(n):\n    i = 1\n    while n % (2**i - 1) != 0:\n        i += 1\n    return 2**(i-1) - 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(largest_beautiful_divisor(n))\n\nThis code finds the largest beautiful divisor of a number by iteratively checking for divisors of the form `(2^i - 1)` until it finds a divisor that fits the criteria. It then returns this divisor.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number could be negative or zero, additional error checking should be added to handle these cases.\n\nAlso, this code uses a while loop to find the largest divisor. This loop continues until `n % (2**i", "def greatest_beautiful_divisor(n):\n    # Initialize result\n    result = 1\n\n    # Find all divisors of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If divisor is beautiful, update result\n            if i * i == n or n // i * i == n:\n                result = max(result, i)\n\n    return result\n\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the square root of n. For each number i, if i is a divisor of n, it checks if i * i or (n // i) * i is equal to n. If it is, it updates the result to the maximum of the current result and i. Finally, it returns the result.\n\nNote: This", "def greatest_beautiful_divisor(n):\n    # Find the largest power of 2 that divides n\n    power = 0\n    while (n >> (power + 1)) & 1:\n        power += 1\n\n    # The divisor is 2^(power-1) - 1\n    return 1 << (power - 1)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\nprint(greatest_beautiful_divisor(n))\n\n\nThis program works by finding the largest power of 2 that divides n. This power is then used to calculate the greatest beautiful divisor. The calculation is based on the fact that a number is beautiful iff it is equal to (2^{k} - 1) * (2^{k} - 1).\n\nThe main idea is that the binary representation of a number is a", "def greatest_beautiful_divisor(n):\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n /= 2\n    divisor = 3\n    while divisor * divisor <= n:\n        if n % divisor:\n            divisor += 2\n        else:\n            while n % divisor == 0:\n                n /= divisor\n            return n\n    if n > 1:\n        return n\n\nprint(greatest_beautiful_divisor(int(input().strip())))\n\n\nThe solution works by first removing all factors of 2 from the number, then checking for all odd divisors. If a divisor is found, it is removed from the number and the result is returned. If no divisor is found, the remaining number is returned.\n\nThe function `greatest_beautiful_divisor` takes an integer `n"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nRecently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of k + 1 consecutive ones, and then k consecutive zeroes.\n\nSome examples of beautiful numbers:   1_2 (1_10);  110_2 (6_10);  1111000_2 (120_10);  111110000_2 (496_10). \n\nMore formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer k such that the number is equal to (2^{k} - 1) * (2^{k} - 1).\n\nLuba has got an integer number n, and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor.
