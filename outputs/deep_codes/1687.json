If such a number is found, it is returned. If no such number is found, -1 is returned. The function is then called with the input from the user.\n\nThe function `all` is used with a generator expression to check if all elements in the array are divisible by the current number. The `%` operator is used to check the divisibility.

It iterates through the array and keeps updating the gcd. If at any point the gcd becomes 1, it returns 1. If the final gcd is greater than 1, it returns -1.\n\nThe gcd function is part of Python's math module. It returns the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n\nThe", "n = int(input())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ndef find_gcd(x, y):\n    while(y):\n        x, y = y, x % y\n    return x\n\ngcd = arr[0]\nfor i in range(1, len(arr)):\n    gcd = find_gcd(gcd, arr[i])\n\nif gcd == 1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(gcd)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution works by first reading in the array and the number of elements. Then, it uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the numbers in the array. If the gcd is 1, it means that no number in the array can divide all the other numbers, so it prints -1.

If they are, it returns the number, otherwise, it returns -1.\n\nThis solution is correct because it checks each element of the array to see if it is divisible by the smallest number in the array, which is the definition of a divisor. If all elements are divisible by this number, then it is the number we are looking for.

It starts with the first element of the array and calculates the gcd with the next element. This process continues until the end of the array. The final gcd is the common divisor that is common to all elements in the array. If the array consists of elements that don't have any common divisor other than 1, the function will return 1.\n\nNote: The `math.gcd` function is"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nKsusha is a beginner coder. Today she starts studying arrays. She has array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, consisting of n positive integers.\n\nHer university teacher gave her a task.
