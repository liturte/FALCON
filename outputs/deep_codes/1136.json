{"1136": {"code": ["n, m = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\nprint(sum(n % i for i in range(1, m + 1)) % MOD)\n\n\nThis solution uses the built-in Python function sum() to sum up the modulus of n for all i in the range from 1 to m (inclusive). The modulus operator % is used to get the remainder of the division of n by i. The result is then taken modulo MOD (10^9 + 7) to ensure it fits within the required 10^9 + 7 range.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a generator expression to calculate the modulus for each i in the range, avoiding the need for a temporary list or array. This means the memory usage is constant, regardless of the size of the range, which makes it suitable for large inputs.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m), because it needs to calculate the modulus for each i in the range from 1 to m. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of memory to store the input values and the result.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is provided in the format specified in the problem statement.", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(sum(n % i for i in range(1, m + 1)) % (10**9 + 7))\n\n\nThis code works by taking in the input of two numbers, n and m, separated by a space. It then calculates the sum of the modulus of n with all numbers from 1 to m inclusive, and finally, it prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe sum(n % i for i in range(1, m + 1)) part is a generator expression that calculates the modulus of n with each number in the range from 1 to m inclusive, and sums them up. The result of this is then modulus 10^9 + 7 by using the % operator, which calculates the remainder of the division of the sum by 10^9 + 7.\n\nThis code will run in O(m) time because it iterates over the range from 1 to m inclusive once.\n\nThis code will print the correct output for all possible inputs as per the problem statement.\n\nNote: The input and output are large integers (up to 10^13), and the modulo operation can be", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nMOD = 10**9+7\nprint(sum(n%i for i in range(1, m+1))%MOD)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution uses Python's built-in `sum` function and a generator expression to calculate the sum of `n mod i` for `i` from 1 to `m`. The modulo operator `%` is used to get the remainder of the division, and the result is then taken modulo `10**9 + 7` to avoid overflow.\n\nThis solution works because the modulo operation is distributive over addition, meaning `(a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n`. This allows the sum to be calculated in a single pass without needing to store the intermediate results.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m), and the space complexity is O(1), making it efficient even for large inputs.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input values `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 10**13.\n\nAlso, this solution requires Python 3.5 or later, because it uses the wal", "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nmod = 10**9 + 7\nsum_mod = sum(n % i for i in range(1, m + 1)) % mod\nprint(sum_mod)\n\n\nThis program calculates the sum of the modulus of n mod i for i in range 1 to m (inclusive). The sum is then taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure the result fits within the specified range. The input is read from the user, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nThis solution uses a generator expression to calculate the modulus for each i in the range, and then sum() is used to calculate the total sum. This approach is more efficient than using a list comprehension, which would require storing all the modulus values in memory.\n\nThe use of the modulo operator ensures that the sum is always within the range of 0 to 10^9 + 6, which is the remainder when divided by 10^9 + 7. The result is then printed to the console.", "def solve(n, m):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    return sum(n % i for i in range(1, m+1)) % MOD\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, m))\n\n\nThis solution works by summing the remainder of n mod i for i in the range from 1 to m (inclusive). The sum is then taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure the result fits within the required range.\n\nIt uses Python's built-in function map() to convert the input into integers. This is followed by the use of the built-in function sum() to calculate the sum of the remainders. The sum is then taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure the result is within the required range.\n\nThe result is then printed to the console.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the problem statement. If the input could be in a different format, additional error checking would be needed.\n\nAlso note that this solution has a time complexity of O(m), which is the best we can do for this problem since we have to calculate the modulo of"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nCalculate the value of the sum: n mod 1 + n mod 2 + n mod 3 + ... + n mod m.
