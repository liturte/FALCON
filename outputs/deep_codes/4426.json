{"4426": {"code": ["days = [\"SUN\", \"MON\", \"TUE\", \"WED\", \"THU\", \"FRI\", \"SAT\"]\nS = input()\nprint((7 - days.index(S)) % 7)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe `days` list represents the days of the week. The `index()` function is used to find the position of the day in the list. The `7 - days.index(S)` calculates the number of days left in the week. If today is Sunday, it will return 7 (since Sunday is the 0th day in the list). If today is any other day, it will return a number less than 7. The `% 7` operation ensures that the result is always between 0 and 6, which represent the number of days in a week.\n\nFor example, if today is Saturday (S), `days.index(S)` returns 5 (since Saturday is the 5th day in the list), so `7 - days.index(S)` returns 2. The `% 7` operation ensures that the result is 2, which means there are 2 days left until the next Sunday.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always a valid day of the week. If this is not the case, you might want to add error checking to handle invalid inputs.\n\"\"\"\n\nS = input()\nif S in days:\n    print", "days = ['SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']\ns = input()\nprint((7 - days.index(s)) % 7 or 7)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe script takes the input day of the week as a string. It uses the list `days` to represent the days of the week. The `index` method of the list is used to find the position of the input day in the list. The index of the next Sunday is `7 - index`. The modulo operator is used to ensure the result is in the range 0 to 6. If the result is 0, it is changed to 7 to represent a 7-day cycle.\n\nNOTE: This script assumes that the input is always a valid day of the week. If the input is not a valid day of the week, the script will raise an error.\n\nThis script is written in Python.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution in Python\ndays = ['SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']\ns = input()\nprint((7 - days.index(s)) % 7 or 7)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nQUESTION:\nGiven an array of integers, find the maximum possible sum of a subarray.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - The length of", "days = [\"SUN\", \"MON\", \"TUE\", \"WED\", \"THU\", \"FRI\", \"SAT\"]\nS = input()\nprint((7 - days.index(S)) % 7)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses Python's list index method (`list.index(element)`). The `index(S)` method returns the position of `S` in the list `days`. The number of days before the next Sunday is calculated as `7 - days.index(S)`. If `S` is the last day of the week (`SAT`), the result will be `7 - 6 = 1`, which is the number of days before the next Sunday (`SUN`). If `S` is a day in the middle of the week (`MON`, `TUE`, etc.), the result will be `7 - position of S`. If `S` is `SUN`, the result will be `7 - 0 = 7`, which means today is Sunday and tomorrow is also Sunday. The modulus operator (`%`) is used to ensure the result is between 0 and 7, which represents the number of days in a week.\n\nThe code is written in Python 3.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Sample Input:\n# SAT\n\n# Sample Output:\n# 1\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Sample", "days = ['SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']\nS = input()\nprint((7 - days.index(S)) % 7 or 7)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution works by creating a list of the days of the week. The `index()` function is used to find the index of the day given as input in the list. The difference between the index of the next day (7 minus the index of today) and the current day is then calculated. If the difference is less than 0, it is wrapped around to the end of the list using the modulo operator (`%`). If the difference is 0, 7 is returned as it represents the number of days until the next day is the same day.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input will always be a valid day of the week. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be necessary.\n\nThe solution also assumes that the list of days is circular, meaning that the day after the last day is the first day. This is a common assumption in many programming problems.\n\nFinally, this solution uses the modulo operator (`%`) to handle the case where the next day is the same day. This is a common technique in many programming problems to handle edge cases.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it only performs a constant number of operations", "import sys\n\ndays = ['SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nprint((7 - days.index(s)) % 7)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe python code above solves the problem by using a list of the days of the week. The index method of the list is used to find the position of the current day in the list. The number of days before the next Sunday is 7 minus the current day's index in the list. The result is then taken modulo 7 to ensure that the result is always between 0 and 6, which corresponds to 0 to 6 days before the next Sunday. The result is printed to the standard output.\n\nThis code assumes that the input is always a valid day of the week. If the input could be invalid, then error checking should be added to handle the case where the input is not one of the seven valid days.\n\nThe code uses the sys.stdin.readline() function to read the input from the standard input. The strip() method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.\n\nThe code uses the index() method of the list to find the position of the current day in the list. The index method returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified value.\n\nThe code uses the mod"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is a string S representing the day of the week today.\nS is SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, respectively.\nAfter how many days is the next Sunday (tomorrow or later)?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of days before the next Sunday.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nSAT\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nIt is Saturday today, and tomorrow will be Sunday.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
