The average of two numbers is the number that you get when you add the two numbers and divide by 2.\n# In this case, the average of A and B is K. So, K = (A + B) / 2.\n# Now, we need to check if |A - K| = |B - K|. If it is true, we print K. If it is not true, we print \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n# The |A - K| = |B - K| condition is satisfied when K is the average of A and", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(A - B) % 2 == 0:\n    print(int((A + B) / 2))\nelse:\n    print(\"IMPOSSIBLE\")\n\n\nThis code works by first taking in the two integers A and B from the user. Then it checks if the absolute difference between A and B is even. If it is, it calculates the middle value of A and B and prints it. If the absolute difference is odd, it prints \"IMPOSSIBLE\" because there is no integer K such that |A - K| = |B - K|.\n\nThis code assumes that the input will be in the format specified in the question. If the input format is different, the code may not work correctly.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle any potential errors.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Solution\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nif abs(A - B) % 2 == 0:\n    print(int((A + B) / 2))\nelse:\n    print(\"IMPOSSIBLE\")\n\n\nThis solution works by first taking in the two integers A and B from the user. Then it checks if the absolute difference between A and B is even. If it is, it calcul", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint((A + B)", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif (A + B) % 2 == 0:\n    print((A + B) // 2)\nelse:\n    print(\"IMPOSSIBLE\")\n\nThis code reads two integers A and B from the input, calculates the arithmetic mean of A and B, and prints it. If the arithmetic mean is not an integer, it prints \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nIn Python, the \"//\" operator is used for integer division, which discards the fraction part and gives the largest integer less than or equal to the exact value. The \"%\" operator gives the remainder of the division. Therefore, if A and B are distinct and their sum is even, their arithmetic mean is an integer and can be calculated as (A + B) // 2. If the sum is not even, the arithmetic mean cannot be an integer, so the code prints \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nThis solution works because the condition \"|A - K| = |B - K|\" can be restated as \"(A + B) / 2 is an integer\". This is the same as \"(A + B) % 2 == 0\", which is checked in the code.\n\nThis solution is correct because it adheres to the problem statement and provides the correct output for all valid inputs.", "A, B = map(int, input().split())\nif (B - A) % 2 == 0:\n    print((B + A) // 2)\nelse:\n    print(\"IMPOSSIBLE\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe condition |A - K| = |B - K| translates to (B - A) / 2 = K - A. \nTo simplify this equation, we add A to both sides to get K = (B + A) / 2.\nIf (B - A) is not even, we cannot find an integer K that satisfies the condition because K must be an integer. \nSo we print \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nThis code works by reading two integers A and B from the input, and then calculating and printing the integer K satisfying the condition.\nIf such an integer does not exist, it prints \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n'''\n\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\nif (B - A) % 2 == 0:\n    print((B + A) // 2)\nelse:\n    print(\"IMPOSSIBLE\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe condition |A - K| = |B - K| translates to (B - A) / 2 = K - A. \nTo simplify"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nWe have two distinct integers A and B.\nPrint the integer K such that |A - K| = |B - K|.\nIf such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 0 \\leq A,\\ B \\leq 10^9\n - A and B are distinct.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the integer K satisfying the condition.\nIf such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 16\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n9\n\n|2 - 9| = 7 and |16 - 9| = 7, so 9 satisfies the condition.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
