If the distance to the friend's house is more than 20, he can reduce the distance by 5 steps and add one more step. Otherwise, he can just move the remaining distance with the minimum number of steps.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log x) because it uses a recursive function to calculate the minimum number", "x = int(input())\nprint((x + 4) // 5)\n\n\nThis solution works by realizing that the elephant can always reach any point by moving in increments of 5. This is because he can always move 5 steps forward, and then take a smaller number of additional steps to reach the desired position. The '//' operator is used to perform integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result. This ensures that the elephant always uses up the full 5 units of movement before moving to the next increment.\n\nFor example, if x = 12, the elephant can reach point 12 by first moving 5 steps (to point 5), then moving 2 steps (to point 7), and finally moving 2 steps (to point 9). This is the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis solution is", "def min_steps(x):\n    dp = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4] + [0] * (x - 5)\n    for i in range(6, x+1):\n        dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], dp[i-3], dp[i-4], dp[i-5]) + 1\n    return dp[x]\n\nprint(min_steps(int(input())))\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create an array dp where dp[i] will store the minimum number of steps required to reach position i.\n\nThe base cases are:\n- dp[0] = 0, as we start at position 0.\n- d"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAn elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x(x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward.
