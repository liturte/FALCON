Print required $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any (arbitrary) order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$, and $z$ ($1 \\le x, y, z \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer:  \"NO\" in the only line of the output if a solution doesn't exist;  or \"YES\" in the first line and any valid triple of positive integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^9$) in the second line. You can print $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any order. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3 2 3\n100 100 100\n50 49 49\n10 30 20\n1 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutput\nYES\n3 2 1\nYES\n100 100 100\nNO\nNO\nYES\n1 1 1000000000\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
