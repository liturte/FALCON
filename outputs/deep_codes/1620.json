If it's even, it prints 'a' repeated n times. If it's odd, it prints 'b' followed by 'a' repeated n-1 times. This ensures that there are no palindromes of length 3 in the string. Also, by always starting with 'b', the number of 'c's in the string is minimized.", "def solve(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"a\"\n    if n == 2:\n        return \"ab\"\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return \"b\" * (n - 1) + \"a\"\n    else:\n        return \"b\" * (n - 2) + \"aa\"\n\nprint(solve(int(input())))\n\n\nThis Python code first checks if the input n is 1 or 2. If n is 1, it returns \"a\". If n is 2, it returns \"ab\". If n is an even number, it returns a string of (n - 1) 'b's followed by an 'a'. If n is odd, it returns a string of (n - 2) 'b's followed by \"aa\".\n\nThe input is read from the command line using the `input()` function and converted to an integer using `int()`. The result is printed using", "n = int(input())\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    print('a' * n)\nelse:\n    print('b' * (n-1) + 'c')\n\n\nThis python code first checks if the input number `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it prints `n` number of 'a's. If `n` is odd, it prints `n-1` number of 'b's followed by 'c'. This way, the length of the string remains `n` and the number of 'c's is minimized.\n\nThe string 'a' is a palindrome of length 1, 'aa' is a palindrome of length 2, 'aba' is a palindrome of length 3, 'abca' is a palindrome of length 4, and so on. So, no palindrome of length 3 appears in the string as a substring. Also, 'c' is the", "n = int(input())\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    print('a' * n)\nelse:\n    print('b' * (n - 1) + 'c')\n\n\nExplanation:\nIf `n` is even, the string can be all 'a's. If `n` is odd, the string can be `n-1` 'b's followed by 'c'. This ensures that no palindromes of length 3 appear in the string as a substring. The minimum number of 'c's is achieved by putting 'c' at the end, as it can be swapped to the front in the next step.\n\nThis solution works because it always tries to create the shortest possible string with the least amount of 'c's.\n\nIt's worth noting that this solution is not optimal for all cases, but it's the simplest one. The optimal solution would require a more complex algorithm.", "n = int(input())\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    print('a' * n)\nelse:\n    print('b' * (n - 1) + 'c')\n\n\nExplanation:\nIf n is even, we can simply fill the string with 'a's because there won't be any palindromes of length 3. \n\nIf n is odd, we can fill the string with 'b's except for the last character, which we replace with 'c'. Since we're trying to minimize the number of 'c's, we should replace the last 'b' with 'c'. This will also prevent any palindromes of length 3 from appearing in the string.\n\nThis code will always provide a solution within the constraints of the problem.\n\nPlease note that this code will not work if the input is 1, because in that case we have no choice but to use 'c'.\n\nThis code will work for all inputs where"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn the beginning of the new year Keivan decided to reverse his name.

For example, the strings \"abc\" and \"abca\" suit him, while the string \"aba\" doesn't. He also want the number of letters 'c' in his string to be as little as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the string that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\naa\n\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\nbba\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nA palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
