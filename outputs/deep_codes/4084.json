The number of times the pattern \"bbr\" repeats is `N // (A + B)`.\nThe remaining balls in the row after the pattern", "def solve(n, a, b):\n    q, r = divmod(n, a + b)\n    r = min(r, a)\n    return q * a + r\n\nn, a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, a, b))\n\n\nThis code works by dividing the total number of balls (n) by the sum of the number of blue and red balls (a + b). The quotient (q) gives the number of times the pattern of blue followed by red can fit into the total number of balls. The remainder (r) gives the number of balls left over after this pattern has been used. If there are more than the number of blue balls in the remainder, we adjust the remainder to be equal to the number of blue balls. Finally, we return the number of blue balls in the pattern times the number of patterns plus the number of blue balls in the remainder", "N, A, B = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Total number of operations\ntotal_operations = 10**100\n\n# Number of operations per ball\noperations_per_ball = total_operations // (A + B)\n\n# Remaining balls after full operations\nremaining_balls = N % (operations_per_ball * A)\n\n# Number of blue balls in remaining balls\nblue_balls = min(remaining_balls, A)\n\nprint(blue_balls)\n\n\nThis program first calculates the number of operations per ball by dividing the total number of operations by the sum of A and B. Then, it calculates the remaining balls after the full operations and the number of blue balls in these remaining balls. The minimum of these two values is the number of blue balls in the first N balls.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O", "def solve(N, A, B):\n    q, r = divmod(N, A + B)\n    return q * A + min(A, r)\n\nN, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(N, A, B))\n\n\nThis code reads the input and calls the solve function with the parameters. The solve function calculates the number of blue balls by dividing the total number of balls by the sum of the number of blue and red balls (q), and then multiplying the result by the number of blue balls. The remainder of the division (r) is the number of balls that are not part of a cycle of blue and red balls. The function returns the total number of blue balls plus the minimum of the number of blue balls in the last cycle and the remainder.\n\nThe min function is used to ensure that the number of blue balls in the last cycle is not greater than the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nTakahashi has many red balls and blue balls.
