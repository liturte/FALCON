Now you are asked to find such an integer point $x$ on $OX$ axis that $f_k(x)$ is minimal possible.\n\nThe function $f_k(x)$ can be described in the following way:   form a list of distances $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$ where $d_i = |a_i - x|$ (distance between $a_i$ and $x$);  sort list $d$ in non-descending order;  take $d_{k + 1}$ as a result. \n\nIf there are multiple optimal answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer $T$ ($ 1 \\le T \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 number of queries. Next $2 \\cdot T$ lines contain descriptions of queries. All queries are independent. \n\nThe first line of each query contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $0 \\le k < n$) \u2014 the number of points and constant $k$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n \\le 10^9$) \u2014 points in ascending order.\n\nIt's guaranteed that $\\sum{n}$ doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ integers \u2014 corresponding points $x$ which have minimal possible value of $f_k(x)$. If there are multiple answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 2\n1 2 5\n2 1\n1 1000000000\n1 0\n4\n\nOutput\n3\n500000000\n4\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
