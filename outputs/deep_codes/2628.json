The gray code sequence for n bits is calculated based on the gray code sequence for n-1 bits. The gray code sequence for n bits is obtained by appending the nth bit to the gray code sequence for n-1 bits in reverse order.\n\nThe initial gray code sequence for 0 bits is [0].

For each bit position from 0 to n-1, it appends the existing codes with a bit set to 1 (and the existing codes reversed). The base case is `res = [0]`, which is the starting point for the gray code sequence.\n\nThe pow(2, i) is used to shift the bit to the correct position. The reversed function is used to reverse the order of the existing codes before appending, so that the new codes are in the correct order for gray code.\n\nThe time complexity of", "class Solution:\n    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:\n        res = [0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            res += [x + (1 << i) for x in res[::-1]]\n        return res\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution uses the bit manipulation to generate the Gray Code sequence. \n\nFirst, we initialize the result list with 0. Then for each bit position from the least significant bit up to the most significant bit, we append to the result list all the existing numbers in the result list but with a bit set at the current position. \n\nThis is done by reversing the result list, iterating over its elements, adding a bit set at the current position to each of them, and appending the result to the result list.\n\nFinally, we return", "class Solution:\n    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:\n        if n == 0:\n            return [0]\n        res = [0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            res += [x + (1 << i) for x in res[::-1]]\n        return res\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution uses the fact that the gray code sequence is obtained by appending the reverse of the current sequence with a bit set to 1 at the appropriate position. This is done for each bit from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.\n\nFor each bit, we append the reverse of the current sequence (`res[::-1]`) to the current sequence (`res`). The bit is set to 1 at the appropriate position by using the bitwise shift operator (`", "class Solution:\n    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:\n        res = [0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            res += [x + pow(2, i) for x in reversed(res)]\n        return res\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis solution generates the gray code sequence by iteratively appending the current sequence with the reversed sequence plus the value of 2 raised to the current index. It starts from 0 and generates the sequence up to 2^n.\n\nThe reason behind this solution is that the gray code sequence is generated by taking the current sequence and appending the reversed sequence plus the value of 2 raised to the current index. This ensures that the difference between consecutive numbers in the sequence is always one bit.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(2^"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThe gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.\n\nGiven a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code.
