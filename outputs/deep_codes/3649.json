If the same subsequence can be obtained in exactly $t$ different ways, by removing different subsets of characters, we say that the subsequence occurs $t$ times. \n\nJingfei wants to create a nonempty bit string that has the following properties:\n - the subsequence 00 occurs $a$ times,\n - the subsequence 01 occurs $b$ times,\n - the subsequence 10 occurs $c$ times, and\n - the subsequence 11 occurs $d$ times.\n\nHowever, Jingfei does not know how to create such a string \u2013 or whether it is even possible. Could you help her?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line with four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ ($0 \\leq a,b,c,d \\leq 10^9$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a bit string that satisfies the given requirements. If there are several solutions, output any one of them. If there are no solutions, output \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 4 2 1\nSample Output:\n01001\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
