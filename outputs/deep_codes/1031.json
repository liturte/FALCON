The next line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of all a_{i} doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint max\u00a0|y_{i} - y_{j}| lines (where y_{k} is the y coordinate of the k-th point of the polyline), in each line print $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i}$ characters. Each character must equal either \u00ab / \u00bb (slash), \u00ab \\ \u00bb (backslash), \u00ab \u00bb (space). The printed image must be the image of the given polyline. Please study the test samples for better understanding of how to print a cardiogram.\n\nNote that in this problem the checker checks your answer taking spaces into consideration. Do not print any extra characters. Remember that the wrong answer to the first pretest doesn't give you a penalty.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n3 1 2 5 1\n\nOutput\n      / \\     \n   / \\ /   \\    \n  /       \\   \n /         \\  \n          \\ / \n\nInput\n3\n1 5 1\n\nOutput\n / \\     \n  \\    \n   \\   \n    \\  \n     \\ /\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
