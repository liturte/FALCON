If N is an even number, it prints N divided by 2. If N is an odd number, it prints N divided by 2 plus 1. This is because for each even number of pages, two pages can be printed on one sheet, and for each odd number of pages, one page can be printed on one sheet.\n\nThe \"//\" operator is used for integer division in Python. It divides the two operands and returns the floor of the result.\n\nThe \"%\" operator is the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the number on its left by the number on its right.\n\nThe \"if\" statement is used to check if the remainder of the division of N by 2 is 0. If it is, then N is an even number.

The '//' operator in Python performs integer division, which rounds down. So we add 1 to the number of pages and then divide by 2.

It does this by dividing the number of pages by 2 (rounding up because you can't have a fraction of a sheet), then adding 1 if the number of pages is odd. This is because you always need at least one sheet, even if you only need to print one page.\n\nThis program reads the number of pages from the standard input, converts it to an integer (if it's not already), and then performs the division and rounding. The result is then printed to the standard output.\n\nHere's how it works with the sample input of 5:\n\n- The number of pages is 5.\n- The program divides 5 by 2, which is 2.5.\n- The program rounds up to 3, because you can't have a fraction of a sheet.\n- The program adds 1 to get 4.\n- The result is 4, so Takahashi needs 4 sheets of paper.\n\nThis program works for all integers from 1 to 100, inclusive.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nprint((int(input())+1)//2)\n\n\nThis Python program calculates the number of", "N = int(input())\nsheets = (N + 1) // 2\nprint(sheets)\n\n\nThis program works by taking the input N, and dividing it by 2 (rounding up because we can't have a fraction of a sheet).

Since two pages of data can be printed on one sheet of paper, we need to divide the number of pages by 2. However, we need to round up the result because we can't have a fraction of a sheet. If N is an even number, we can divide it by 2 directly. If N is an odd number, we need to add 1 before dividing by 2. This can be done by using the floor division operator `//`, which rounds the result down to the nearest integer.\n'''\n\n# Test Cases\n\n\nprint(", "N = int(input())\nprint((N + 1) // 2)\n\n\nExplanation:\nSince two pages can be printed on one sheet, the number of sheets needed is the same as the number of pages plus one, divided by two.
