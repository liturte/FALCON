However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of n - 1 positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1. For every integer i where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1 the condition 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n - i holds. Next, he made n - 1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) portal connects cell i and cell (i + a_{i}), and one can travel from cell i to cell (i + a_{i}) using the i-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (i + a_{i}) to cell i using the i-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n - i one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell t.
