In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:  Divide $n$ by any of its odd divisors greater than $1$.  Subtract $1$ from $n$ if $n$ is greater than $1$. \n\nDivisors of a number include the number itself.\n\nThe player who is unable to make a move loses the game.\n\nAshishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer \u00a0\u2014 $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"Ashishgup\" if he wins, and \"FastestFinger\" otherwise (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n12\n\nOutput\nFastestFinger\nAshishgup\nAshishgup\nFastestFinger\nAshishgup\nFastestFinger\nAshishgup\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, $n = 1$, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.\n\nIn the second test case, $n = 2$, Ashishgup subtracts $1$ on the first move. Now $n = 1$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.\n\nIn the third test case, $n = 3$, Ashishgup divides by $3$ on the first move. Now $n = 1$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.\n\nIn the last test case, $n = 12$, Ashishgup divides it by $3$. Now $n = 4$, FastestFinger is forced to subtract $1$, and Ashishgup gets $3$, so he wins by dividing it by $3$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
