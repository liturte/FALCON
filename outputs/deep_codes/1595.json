Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.\n\nFortunately, Picks remembers something about his set S:  its elements were distinct integers from 1 to limit;  the value of $\\sum_{x \\in S} \\text{lowbit}(x)$ was equal to sum; here lowbit(x) equals 2^{k} where k is the position of the first one in the binary representation of x. For example, lowbit(10010_2) = 10_2, lowbit(10001_2) = 1_2, lowbit(10000_2) = 10000_2 (binary representation). \n\nCan you help Picks and find any set S, that satisfies all the above conditions?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers: sum, limit (1 \u2264 sum, limit \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), denoting the size of S. Then print the elements of set S in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nIf it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n\nOutput\n2\n4 5\n\nInput\n4 3\n\nOutput\n3\n2 3 1\n\nInput\n5 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn sample test 1: lowbit(4) = 4, lowbit(5) = 1, 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nIn sample test 2: lowbit(1) = 1, lowbit(2) = 2, lowbit(3) = 1, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
