The number of cards that face down is equal to half of the total number of cards. Since each operation flips every card in the target square and the eight squares that share a corner or a side with the target square, the total number of cards is N * M. Hence, the number of cards that face down is (N * M) // 2.\n\nIn the given sample input, N = 2 and M = 2. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the grid is infinite, and that the cards can be placed in any location. If the grid has a finite size, the number of cards that face down will be less than or equal to the total number", "def solve(n, m):\n    return 0\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, m))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem asks for the number of cards that face down after all the operations. Since the cards are initially all facing up, and the operations do not affect the face of the cards, all cards will remain facing up after all the operations. Therefore, the number of cards that face down is 0.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef solve(n, m):\n    return 0\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, m))\n\nThis code reads the input, calls the solve function with the input values, and then prints the result. The solve function always returns 0, because the problem does not depend on the input values.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nThis is a simple problem that can be solved by pure code without any need", "N, M = map(int, input().split())\nprint((N * M) % 2)\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the number of cards facing up or down is dependent only on whether the total number of cards is even or odd. Since the number of cards is N*M, and we can flip any card by flipping it and its neighbours, the number of cards facing down will be 0 if N*M is even, and 1 if N*M is odd.\n\nThis solution uses the modulus operator (%) to compute the remainder of the division of N*M by 2. If the remainder is 0, then N*M is even, and the result is 0. If the remainder is 1, then N*M is odd, and the result is 1.\n\nThis solution works because the number of operations performed on each card does not depend on the order in which the operations are performed. Therefore, the state of each", "N, M = map(int, input().split())\nprint(N * M)\n\nThis is a simple solution. Since the grid has infinitely many rows and columns, the number of cards that face down after all the operations is equal to the area of the rectangular region, which is N * M.\n\nThis solution works because each card in the rectangular region is flipped once in any of the 9 operations, and all cards are initially faced up. So, all cards are faced down after all operations.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the operations do not depend on the order they are performed.\n\nThis solution is written in Python language.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it always takes the same amount of time to run, regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(1), which means it always uses the same amount of memory, regardless of the size of the input.", "def solve(n, m):\n    return 0\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(solve(n, m))\n\nThis solution always returns 0 because the problem statement specifies that the cards always face up after all operations.\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\n\"\"\"\nQUESTION:\nGiven a sequence of N integers, determine if it is possible to sort this sequence using a combination of at most K operations of the following two types of operations:\n\n - Choose any element from the sequence, and decrease its value by 1.\n - Choose any subarray of the sequence, and decrease all elements in this subarray by the same value.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq sequence[i] \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nThere is a grid with infinitely many rows and columns.
