VisuAlgo visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms in the Computer Science curriculum.

As an example, the above figure shows a question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination) Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this online quiz feature is that the question parameters are randomized. The drawn graph G is taken from a collection of hundreds of directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in VisuAlgo\u2019s internal database. The graph G has $V$ vertices numbered from $[0..V-1]$. The source vertex $s$ and the destination vertex $t$ are selected at random from $[0..V-1]$.\n\nHowever, such randomization of the question parameters may produce either a trivial question (e.g. \u201cNo Answer\u201d when $s$ and $t$ are disconnected, $0$ when $s = t$, simple tracing of a path if there is only a single unique path from $s$ to $t$ as shown in the above figure) or insanely difficult question to be computed manually if there are too many possible shortest paths from $s$ to $t$.\n\nThe developers of VisuAlgo want to calibrate such Shortest Paths question with randomized parameters so that it is possible for a normal Computer Science student to answer the randomly generated question manually within a reasonable amount of time.
