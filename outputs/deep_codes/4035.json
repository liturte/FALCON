(Yen is the currency of Japan.)\nHere, the price before tax must be a positive integer, and the amount of consumption tax is rounded down to the nearest integer.\nIf multiple prices satisfy the condition, print the lowest such price; if no price satisfies the condition, print -1.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 100\n - A and B are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is a price that satisfies the condition, print an integer representing the lowest such price; otherwise, print -1.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n25\n\nIf the price of a product before tax is 25 yen, the amount of consumption tax levied on it is:\n - When the consumption tax rate is 8 percent: \\lfloor 25 \\times 0.08 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2 yen.\n - When the consumption tax rate is 10 percent: \\lfloor 25 \\times 0.1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor = 2 yen.\nThus, the price of 25 yen satisfies the condition. There are other possible prices, such as 26 yen, but print the minimum such price, 25.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
