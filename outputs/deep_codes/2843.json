There are no duplicate letters in any word. A set of words $S \\subseteq W$ is called \u201cswap-free\u201d if there is no way to turn a word $x \\in S$ into another word $y \\in S$ by swapping only a single pair of (not necessarily adjacent) letters in $x$. Find the size of the largest swap-free set $S$ chosen from the given set $W$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 500$). Following that are $N$ lines each with a single word. Every word contains only lowercase English letters and no duplicate letters. All $N$ words are unique, have at least one letter, and every word is an anagram of every other word.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the size of the largest swap-free set.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6\nabc\nacb\ncab\ncba\nbac\nbca\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n11\nalerts\nalters\nartels\nestral\nlaster\nratels\nsalter\nslater\nstaler\nstelar\ntalers\nSample Output 2:\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
