The color of the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left (1 \\leq i \\leq H, 1 \\leq j \\leq W) is given to you as a character c_{i,j}: the square is white if c_{i,j} is ., and black if c_{i,j} is #.\nConsider doing the following operation:\n - Choose some number of rows (possibly zero), and some number of columns (possibly zero). Then, paint red all squares in the chosen rows and all squares in the chosen columns.\nYou are given a positive integer K. How many choices of rows and columns result in exactly K black squares remaining after the operation? Here, we consider two choices different when there is a row or column chosen in only one of those choices.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq H, W \\leq 6\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq HW\n - c_{i,j} is . or #.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W K\nc_{1,1}c_{1,2}...c_{1,W}\nc_{2,1}c_{2,2}...c_{2,W}\n:\nc_{H,1}c_{H,2}...c_{H,W}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint an integer representing the number of choices of rows and columns satisfying the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 3 2\n..#\n###\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nFive choices below satisfy the condition.\n - The 1-st row and 1-st column\n - The 1-st row and 2-nd column\n - The 1-st row and 3-rd column\n - The 1-st and 2-nd column\n - The 3-rd column\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
