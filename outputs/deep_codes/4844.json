In order to destroy The Death Star, he needs an array of non-negative integers $a_ i$ of length $N$ that represents the code for initiating the self-destruction of The Death Star. Ivan doesn\u2019t have the array, but he has a piece of paper with requirements for that array, given to him by his good old friend Darth Vader.\n\nOn the paper, a square matrix of the size $N$ is written down. In that matrix $m$ in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column there is a number that is equal to bitwise and between numbers $a_ i$ and $a_ j$. Unfortunately, a lightsaber has destroyed all the fields on the matrix\u2019s main diagonal and Ivan cannot read what is on these fields. Help Ivan to reconstruct an array for the self-destruction of The Death Star that meets the requirements of the matrix.\n\nThe solution doesn\u2019t need to be unique, but will always exist.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$), size of the matrix. Each of the following $N$ lines contains $N$ numbers $m_{ij}$ ($0 \\leq m_{ij} \\leq 10^9$), the elements of the matrix.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain any array of $N$ non-negative integers at most $10^9$ that meet the requirements from the task.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n0 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\nSample Output 1:\n1 1 1\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 2 0 2\n1 2 0 1 3\n1 0 1 0 1\n1 2 3 1 0\nSample Output 2:\n1 2 3 1 11\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
