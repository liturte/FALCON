Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.\n\nArray a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:  a_1 \u2264 a_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 a_{n};  a_1 \u2265 a_2 \u2265 ... \u2265 a_{n}. \n\nHelp Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} \u2014 the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 10^9.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n1 2\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.\n\nIn the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
