He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFirst print k\u00a0\u2014 the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.
