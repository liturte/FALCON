The result is then used as the new input number and the process is repeated until the result is a single digit.

Inside the function, a while loop is used to repeatedly multiply the nonzero digits of `x` until `x` is a single digit between 1 and 9. This is done by converting `x` to a string, iterating over each character in the string (which are the digits of `x`), converting the character back to an integer, and multiplying it with the current product. The result is then assigned back to `x`.

The function then enters a loop that continues until the input integer is less than 10. Inside the loop, the code multiplies all nonzero digits of the input integer together and updates the input integer to this product. The function finally returns the final product as the output.

Repeating this process, you eventually arrive at a single digit between $1$ and $9$. Write a program that reads $x$ and outputs the resulting digit.\n\n-----Input-----\nAn integer $x$ with $10 \\leq x \\leq 1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a digit between $1$ and $9$, the result of repeatedly multiplying the nonzero digits of $x$ as described above.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Inputs-----\nIn Sample Input $1$, we have $x = 808$. Multiplying $8$ and $8$, we arrive at $64$. Then we get $6 \\cdot 4 = 24$, and finally $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$, which is the sample output.\n\nIn Sample Input $2$, there is only a single nonzero digit, $2$. The product of all digits in a set containing only a single element is the digit itself. Thus the answer is $2$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n808\nSample Output:\n8\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
