An older bull moose tends to have more tines than a younger moose. However, just counting the number of tines can be misleading, as a moose can break off the tines, for example when fighting with other moose. Therefore, a point system is used when describing the antlers of a bull moose. \n\nThe point system works like this: If the number of tines on the left side and the right side match, the moose is said to have the even sum of the number of points. So, \u201can even $6$-point moose\u201d, would have three tines on each side. If the moose has a different number of tines on the left and right side, the moose is said to have twice the highest number of tines, but it is odd. So \u201can odd $10$-point moose\u201d would have $5$ tines on one side, and $4$ or less tines on the other side.\n\nCan you figure out how many points a moose has, given the number of tines on the left and right side?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single line with two integers $\\ell $ and $r$, where $0 \\le \\ell \\le 20$ is the number of tines on the left, and $0 \\le r \\le 20$ is the number of tines on the right.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line describing the moose. For even pointed moose, output \u201cEven $x$\u201d where $x$ is the points of the moose. For odd pointed moose, output \u201cOdd $x$\u201d where $x$ is the points of the moose. If the moose has no tines, output \u201cNot a moose\u201d\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 3\nSample Output 1:\nOdd 6\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 3\nSample Output 2:\nEven 6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
