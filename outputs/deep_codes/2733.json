The objects are droplets that are modeled in two dimensions as circles of various sizes, each moving at a constant velocity. When two circles touch they combine (i.e., agglomerate) into a single circular droplet with an area equal to the sum of the areas of the two combining droplets. The newly formed droplet\u2019s position is the area-weighted average position of the two droplets at the time of contact and its velocity is the area-weighted average velocity of the two circles. (See the following example.)The figure to the right illustrates the process of agglomeration. In the top panel of that figure, we see the leftmost droplet with radius $4$ centered at position $(-14,0)$ and with velocity $(1,0)$ moving toward a stationary droplet of radius\u00a0$3$ centered at the origin.

The first line contains the original number of droplets, $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$. This is followed by $N$ lines of data, each containing five integers, $x$, $y$, $v_ x$, $v_ y$, $r$, respectively specifying the $x$-coordinate of the center, the $y$-coordinate of the center, the $x$-component of the velocity, the $y$-component of the velocity, and the radius. These quantities are bounded such that $-10000 \\leq x,y,v_ x,v_ y \\leq 10000$ and $1 \\leq r \\leq 100$.\n\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with two values $k$ and $t$, where $k$ is the number of droplets in the final configuration and $t$ is the time at which the final agglomeration occurred. If a data set results in no agglomerations, $k$ will be the original number of droplets and $0$ should be reported as the time. The value of time should be reported to have an absolute or relative error of no more than $10^{-3}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n-2 0 2 0 1\n2 0 0 0 1\nSample Output 1:\n1 1.0\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n-2 0 -2 0 1\n2 0 -2 1 1\nSample Output 2:\n2 0.0\n\nSample Input 3:\n4\n-8 0 2 -2 2\n0 -8 -2 2 2\n2 8 0 -4 3\n8 2 -4 0 3\nSample Output 3:\n1 2.0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
