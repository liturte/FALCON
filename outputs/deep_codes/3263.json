So shy, in fact, that the only time she feels comfortable dealing with a customer is when she is wearing the same type of clothing as that customer! When she wears a particular type of clothing, she is able to assume the customer\u2019s personality and make a sale.

(This also means that if multiple customers arrive at the same moment of time, Fluttershy can serve all of them.)\n\nOriginally, Fluttershy is not wearing any clothing. To wear some clothing, she needs to follow the following process:\n - To put on clothing of type $i$, she needs to first ensure that she is not wearing any clothing. Then, she goes to the dressing room and takes $P_ i$ moments of time to put on the clothing. (That is, if she starts to put on clothing at time $t$, she is ready by time $t + P_ i$.)\n - To remove clothing of type $i$, she goes to the dressing room and takes $R_ i$ moments of time to remove the clothing.
