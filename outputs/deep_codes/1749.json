Initially the sequence of integers on the cubes was equal to [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. Stepan could at first swap cubes on positions 2 and 3 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 4, 3, 1]), and then swap cubes in positions 3 and 4 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 3, 4, 1]).\n\nIn the second example it is not possible that Stepan said truth because he said that he swapped cubes only between positions 1 and 2, but we can see that it is guaranteed that he changed the position of the cube which was on the position 3 at first. So it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\n\nIn the third example for any values l and r there is a situation when Stepan said the truth.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
