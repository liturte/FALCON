For every $i > 1$, let $g_ i$ be the leftmost integer in $A$ that is strictly larger than $g_{i-1}$. If there for a given $i$ is no such integer, we say that the GIS of the sequence is the sequence $(g_1, g_2, ..., g_{i - 1})$.\n\nYour task is to, given a permutation $A$, compute the GIS of $A$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $1 \\le N \\le 10^6$, the number of elements of the permutation $A$. The next line contains $N$ distinct integers between $1$ and $N$, the elements $a_1, \\dots , a_ N$ of the permutation $A$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFirst, output a line containing the length $l$ of the GIS of $A$. Then, output $l$ integers, containing (in order) the elements of the GIS.\n\n-----Explanation of sample 1-----\nIn this case, we have the permutation $2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6$. First, we have $g_1 = 2$. The leftmost integer larger than $2$ is $3$, so $g_2 = 3$. The leftmost integer larger than $3$ is $5$ ($1$ is too small), so $g_3 = 5$. The leftmost integer larger than $5$ is $7$, so $g_4 = 7$. Finally, there is no integer larger than $7$. Thus, the GIS of $2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6$ is $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n7\n2 3 1 5 4 7 6\nSample Output 1:\n4\n2 3 5 7\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 2:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
