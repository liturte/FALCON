The leftovers should now be shipped to Singapore. There is, however, one constraint: In the case that one box of apples is infested with apple-eating insects and the next one in the line is also a box of apples, the insects might move on to the neighboring box and infect it as well. This constraint is applicable for boxes of cherries and boxes of mangos too.\n\nIn order to avoid this, ACM decides that the boxes of fruits are to be sent in such a way that two consecutive boxes contain different types of fruits. The statistics department of ACM wants to know how many ways there are to arrange the shipments of $A$ boxes of apples, $C$ boxes of cherries and $M$ boxes of mangos under this constraint.\n\nPlease provide a computer program to compute this for various choices of $A$, $C$, and $M$. Two arrangements are different if there exists $i$ such that the $i$-th box delivered in the two arrangements contain different types of fruits. Since the answer may be very big, output the answer modulo a prime number $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line consisting of three single space separated integers $A$, $C$, and $M$, denoting the total number of boxes of apples, cherries, and mangos you need to ship to Singapore, respectively. All three integers will be between $1$ and $200000$, respectively.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of different possible arrangements of delivery, modulo a prime number $10^9+7$. If there is no such order, output $0$.Sample Data Explanation\n\nIn the first example, the $6$ possible ways are:\n - Apple, Cherry, Mango, Cherry.\n - Cherry, Apple, Cherry, Mango.\n - Cherry, Apple, Mango, Cherry.\n - Cherry, Mango, Apple, Cherry.\n - Cherry, Mango, Cherry, Apple.\n - Mango, Cherry, Apple, Cherry.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 2 2\nSample Output 2:\n30\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
