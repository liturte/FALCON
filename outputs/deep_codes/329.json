{"329": {"code": ["from collections import Counter\n\ns = input().strip()\ncount = Counter(s)\nprint(min(count['n'], count['i'], count['e'], count['t']))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe solution uses the Counter class from the collections module in Python to count the frequency of each character in the input string. Then it finds the minimum frequency of 'n', 'i', 'e', and 't' and prints it. This is because 'nineteen' contains 4 'n's, 2 'i's, 2 'e's, and 1 't'. So the minimum frequency of any of these characters determines the maximum number of 'nineteen's that can be formed.\n\nThis solution assumes that the frequency of 'n', 'i', 'e', and 't' in the string is", "from collections import Counter\n\ns = input()\nnineteen_count = Counter(s)\n\nprint(min(nineteen_count[ch]//19 for ch in 'nineteen'))\n\n\nThis code works by counting the occurrences of each character in the string. Then it finds the minimum count of 'n' and 'e' in the string and divides it by 19 (the length of \"nineteen\"). The result is the maximum number of \"nineteen\"s that can be formed from the given string.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the string contains only lowercase English letters and doesn't have any special characters or numbers. If the string can contain uppercase letters or other special characters, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the string is case sensitive, i.", "from collections import Counter\n\ndef max_nineteens(s):\n    count = Counter(s)\n    return min(count[c]//Counter('nineteen')[c] for c in 'nineteen')\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(max_nineteens(s))\n\n\nThis solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each letter in the string. It then calculates the minimum number of times 'nineteen' can be read from the string by dividing the count of each letter in the string by the count of that letter in 'nineteen'. The function then returns this minimum value.\n\nNote: The `Counter` class automatically handles cases where a letter does not appear in the string, in which case the count is 0. The `", "from collections import Counter\n\ndef max_nineteen(s):\n    c = Counter(s)\n    return min(c['n'], c['i'], c['e'], c['t'], c['e'], c['e'], c['n'])\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(max_nineteen(s))\n\n\nThis solution works by counting the frequency of each character in the string `s` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. Then it returns the minimum of these counts, which represents the maximum number of \"nineteen\"s that can be formed from the characters in `s`.\n\nThe `min` function is used to ensure that the program doesn't count more \"nineteen\"s than exist in the string. For example, if `s` contains 2 'n's", "from collections import Counter\n\ns = input()\ncount = Counter(s)\nnineteen_count = Counter('nineteen')\n\nresult = 0\nfor letter, letter_count in nineteen_count.items():\n    if letter not in count:\n        break\n    else:\n        result = min(result, count[letter] // letter_count)\nelse:\n    result = count['n'] // count['t'] // count['e'] // count['e']\n\nprint(result)\n\n\nThis Python solution uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each letter in the string. It then counts the occurrences of each letter in the word \"nineteen\". The minimum count of 'nineteen's that can be formed from the given string is then printed."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAlice likes word \"nineteen\" very much. She has a string s and wants the string to contain as many such words as possible. For that reason she can rearrange the letters of the string.\n\nFor example, if she has string \"xiineteenppnnnewtnee\", she can get string \"xnineteenppnineteenw\", containing (the occurrences marked) two such words. More formally, word \"nineteen\" occurs in the string the number of times you can read it starting from some letter of the string. Of course, you shouldn't skip letters.\n\nHelp her to find the maximum number of \"nineteen\"s that she can get in her string.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The length of string s doesn't exceed 100.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of \"nineteen\"s that she can get in her string.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nnniinneetteeeenn\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\nnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\nnineteenineteen\n\nOutput\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
