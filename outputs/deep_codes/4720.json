{"4720": {"code": ["N = int(input())\ngroups = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\noccupied = [0] * 100001\n\nfor l, r in groups:\n    occupied[l-1] += 1\n    occupied[r] -= 1\n\nfor i in range(1, 100001):\n    occupied[i] += occupied[i-1]\n\nprint(occupied.count(1))\n\n\nThis solution uses the concept of prefix sums to keep track of the number of people in each seat. For each group of people, we increment the count at the start seat and decrement the count at the end seat. Then, we accumulate these counts to get the total number of people in each seat. Finally, we count the number of seats where exactly one person is sitting.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is well-formed and does not check for errors. If the", "n = int(input())\ngroups = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\noccupied = [0]*100001\nfor group in groups:\n    occupied[group[0]:group[1]+1] = [1]*(group[1]-group[0]+1)\nprint(sum(occupied))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis program first reads the number of groups and the range of seats for each group. It then creates a list `occupied` where the i-th element is 1 if seat i is occupied and 0 otherwise. Finally, it prints the sum of the elements in `occupied`, which is the total number of people at the theater.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(N + M), where N is the number of groups and M is the total number of seats. The space complexity is O(M) for the `occupied` list", "n = int(input())\ngroups = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\noccupied_seats = set()\nfor group in groups:\n    for seat in range(group[0], group[1] + 1):\n        occupied_seats.add(seat)\nprint(len(occupied_seats))\n\n\nThe code works by first reading the number of groups and then the left and right bounds of each group. It then creates a set of occupied seats, adding each seat in each group. Finally, it prints the size of the set, which is the number of unique seats, giving the number of people at the theater.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not check for any errors. It also assumes that all seats are initially empty, so it doesn't need to subtract any seats if they were previously occupied.\n\nAlso note that the code uses Python's set data", "N = int(input())\ngroups = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\noccupied = [0] * 100001\nfor l, r in groups:\n    occupied[l-1:r] = [1]*(r-l+1)\nprint(sum(occupied))\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code first reads the number of groups N and the left and right bounds of each group. It then creates a list of 100001 zeros, representing the seats at the theater. For each group, it sets the seats from l_i to r_i to 1, indicating that they are occupied. Finally, it prints the sum of the occupied seats, which is the number of people currently sitting at the theater.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the number of groups. The space complexity is O(100001", "N = int(input())\ngroups = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\noccupied = set(seat for group in groups for seat in range(group[0], group[1]+1))\nprint(len(occupied))\n\n\nThe code first reads the number of groups and the ranges of seats for each group. It then creates a set of occupied seats. The set automatically removes duplicate seats, because a seat can't be occupied by more than one person. Finally, it prints the number of occupied seats.\n\nThe complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the number of groups. This is because it reads the groups, and for each group, it creates a set of occupied seats. The size of the set is at most the number of seats in the theater, so the time complexity is linear in the number of groups.\n\nThis code is efficient because it avoids unnecessary computation.
