He wants to distribute the balls into boxes in such a way that for every i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) i-th box will contain all balls with color i.\n\nIn order to do this, Ivan will make some turns. Each turn he does the following:  Ivan chooses any non-empty box and takes all balls from this box;  Then Ivan chooses any k empty boxes (the box from the first step becomes empty, and Ivan is allowed to choose it), separates the balls he took on the previous step into k non-empty groups and puts each group into one of the boxes. He should put each group into a separate box. He can choose either k = 2 or k = 3. \n\nThe penalty of the turn is the number of balls Ivan takes from the box during the first step of the turn. And penalty of the game is the total penalty of turns made by Ivan until he distributes all balls to corresponding boxes.\n\nHelp Ivan to determine the minimum possible penalty of the game!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the number of boxes and colors.\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), where a_{i} is the number of balls with color i.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number \u2014 the minimum possible penalty of the game.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n4\n2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n19\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you take all the balls from the first box, choose k = 3 and sort all colors to corresponding boxes. Penalty is 6.\n\nIn the second example you make two turns:   Take all the balls from the first box, choose k = 3, put balls of color 3 to the third box, of color 4 \u2014 to the fourth box and the rest put back into the first box. Penalty is 14;  Take all the balls from the first box, choose k = 2, put balls of color 1 to the first box, of color 2 \u2014 to the second box. Penalty is 5. \n\nTotal penalty is 19.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
