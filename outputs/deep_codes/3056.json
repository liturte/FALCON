Each step in the walk is either a jump onto the left child, onto the right child, or pause for rest (stay in the same node).\n\nA walk is described with a string of letters \u2019L\u2019, \u2019R\u2019 and \u2019P\u2019:\n - \u2019L\u2019 represents a jump to the left child;\n - \u2019R\u2019 represents a jump to the right child;\n - \u2019P\u2019 represents a pause.\n\nThe value of the walk is the label of the node we end up on. For example, the value of the walk LR is 5, while the value of the walk RPP is 3.\n\nA set of walks is described by a string of characters \u2019L\u2019, \u2019R\u2019, \u2019P\u2019 and \u2019*\u2019. Each \u2019*\u2019 can be any of the three moves; the set of walks contains all walks matching the pattern.\n\nFor example, the set L*R contains the walks LLR, LRR and LPR. The set ** contains the walks LL, LR, LP, RL, RR, RP, PL, PR and PP.\n\nFinally, the value of a set of walks is the sum of values of all walks in the set. Calculate the value of the given set of walks.\n\n-----Input-----\nA string describing the set. Only characters \u2019L\u2019, \u2019R\u2019, \u2019P\u2019 and \u2019*\u2019 will appear and there will be at most $10000$ of them.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the value of the set.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nP*P\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\nL*R\nSample Output 2:\n25\n\nSample Input 3:\n**\nSample Output 3:\n33\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
