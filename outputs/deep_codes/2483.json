The first program will be recorded. Note that this recorder will be unable to record other channels from time 0.5 to time 7.\n - With the second recorder, record Channel 1 from time 7 to time 12. The second and third programs will be recorded. Note that this recorder will be unable to record other channels from time 6.5 to time 12.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
