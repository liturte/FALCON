We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are \"abaca\", then the value of that path is $3$. Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two positive integers $n, m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 300\\,000$), denoting that the graph has $n$ nodes and $m$ directed edges.\n\nThe second line contains a string $s$ with only lowercase English letters. The $i$-th character is the letter assigned to the $i$-th node.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $x, y$ ($1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$), describing a directed edge from $x$ to $y$. Note that $x$ can be equal to $y$ and there can be multiple edges between $x$ and $y$. Also the graph can be not connected.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 4\nabaca\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6 6\nxzyabc\n1 2\n3 1\n2 3\n5 4\n4 3\n6 4\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n10 14\nxzyzyzyzqx\n1 2\n2 4\n3 5\n4 5\n2 6\n6 8\n6 5\n2 10\n3 9\n10 9\n4 6\n1 10\n2 8\n3 7\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the path with largest value is $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5$. The value is $3$ because the letter 'a' appears $3$ times.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
