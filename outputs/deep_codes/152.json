Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4\u00b75 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).\n\nIn the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20\u00b710 = 200.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
