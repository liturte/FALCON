Mr. Turtle then noticed that the marker behaved like an eraser for the remainder of his drawing.\n\nMr. Turtle has a picture in his head of how he wants his final drawing to appear. He plans out his entire drawing ahead of time, step by step. Mr. Turtle\u2019s plan is a sequence of commands: up, down, left or right, with a distance. He starts drawing in the bottom left corner of his whiteboard. Consider the $6 \\times 8$ whiteboard and sequence of commands in the first diagram.
