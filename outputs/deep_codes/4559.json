It then initializes a variable `res` to 1. For each integer in A, it multiplies `res` by that integer. If `res` exceeds 10^18, it prints -1 and breaks the loop.

It also assumes that the integers A_i are at least 0 and at most 10^{18}.\n\nThis solution uses a for loop to iterate over the N integers, and a for loop to calculate the product.
