It starts with an array dp where dp[i] represents the number of integers that end with i modulo 13. The array is initialized with dp[0]=1 and the rest of the elements to 0. Then it iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is '?', it doubles the count of all possible numbers so far (because it can be any digit from 0 to 9). If the character is a digit, it adds that digit to all possible numbers so far. The result is the count of numbers that end with 5 modulo 13, which is dp[5]. The result is then printed modulo 10^9+7.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\ndp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(100001)]\ndp[0][0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, 100001):\n    for j in range(13):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][(j-2*int(S[i-1])%13)%13] + dp[i-1][(j+2*int(S[i-1])%13)%13]) % MOD\nprint(dp[len(S)][5])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe code is a dynamic programming solution to this problem. \n\nIt creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is the number of ways to replace the `?` in the first `i` characters of the string so that the resulting integer has a remainder of `j` when divided by 13.\n\nThe base case is `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to replace the `?`", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\ndp = [0]*13\ndp[0] = 1\nfor _ in range(int(input().translate(str.maketrans('?', '0123456789')))):\n    dp = [sum(dp[j] for j in range(13))%MOD for _ in range(13)]\nprint(dp[5])\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe problem can be solved by dynamic programming.\nWe can calculate the number of strings of length i that end with remainder 0, 1, ..., 12 by adding a '0' or '1' to the strings of length i-1 that end with remainder 0, 1, ..., 12.\nWe can calculate the number of strings of length i that end with remainder 0, 1, ..., 12 by adding a '0' or '1' to the strings of length i-1 that end with remainder 0, 1, ..., 12.\nWe can calculate the number of strings of length i that end with remainder 0, 1,", "MOD = 10**9 + 7\ndp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(100005)]\ndp[0][0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, 100005):\n    for j in range(13):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][(j-1)%13] + dp[i-1][(j+1)%13]) % MOD\n\nS = input().strip()\nn = len(S)\ndp2 = [0]*(13)\ndp2[0] = 1\nfor i in range(n):\n    if S[i] == '?':\n        dp2 = [(dp2[(j-1)%13] + dp2[(j+1)%13]) % MOD for j in range(13)]\n    else:\n        dp2 = [(dp2[(j-1)%13] + dp2[(j+1)%13]) % MOD for j in range(13)]\n        d", "MOD = 10**9+7\ndp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(100005)]\ndp[0][0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, 100005):\n    for j in range(13):\n        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][(j-11)%13] + dp[i-1][(j+1)%13]) % MOD\n\nS = input()\ncnt = [0]*13\ncnt[0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(len(S)):\n    if S[i] == '?':\n        cnt = [(cnt[(j-11)%13] + cnt[(j+1)%13]) % MOD for j in range(13)]\n    else:\n        cnt = [(cnt[(j-11)%13] + cnt[(j+1)%13]) % MOD for j in range(13)]\n        cnt[(int(S["], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven is a string S.
