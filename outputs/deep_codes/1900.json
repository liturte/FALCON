Bus has n passenger seats, seat i can be occupied only by a participant from the city a_{i}.\n\nToday the bus has completed m trips, each time bringing n participants. The participants were then aligned in one line in the order they arrived, with people from the same bus standing in the order of their seats (i.\u00a0e. if we write down the cities where the participants came from, we get the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} repeated m times).\n\nAfter that some teams were formed, each consisting of k participants form the same city standing next to each other in the line. Once formed, teams left the line. The teams were formed until there were no k neighboring participants from the same city.\n\nHelp the organizers determine how many participants have left in the line after that process ended. We can prove that answer doesn't depend on the order in which teams were selected.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, k and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5), where a_{i} is the number of city, person from which must take seat i in the bus. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the number of remaining participants in the line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2 5\n1 2 3 1\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n1 9 10\n1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 2 10\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second example, the line consists of ten participants from the same city. Nine of them will form a team. At the end, only one participant will stay in the line.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
