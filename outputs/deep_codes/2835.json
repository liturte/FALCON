Count the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once.\n\nNote that a $substring$ and a $subsequence$ both consist of characters from the original string, in order. In a $substring$, the characters must be contiguous in the original string, but in a $subsequence$, they are not required to be contiguous. In the string abcde, ace is a subsequence but not a substring.\n\nIf $s$ is aa and $t$ is a, then the answer is $3$: [a]a, [aa], and a[a].\n\n-----Input-----\nEach test case will consist of exactly two lines.\n\nThe first line will contain string $s$ ($1\\! \\le \\! |s|\\! \\le \\! 10^5, s\\! \\in \\! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters.\n\nThe second line will contain string $t$ ($1\\! \\le \\! |t|\\! \\le \\! 100, |t|\\! \\le \\! |s|, t\\! \\in \\! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\na\nSample Output 1:\n26\n\nSample Input 2:\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nm\nSample Output 2:\n182\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
