For each length, it finds all substrings of that length and checks if it appears more than once in the string. If it does, it returns that substring.\n\nPlease note that this code is not efficient for large inputs, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2). If efficiency is a concern, you may need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as the Manber-Myers algorithm for finding the longest repeated substring in linear time.\n\nThis code also assumes that the input string will contain at least one repeated substring. If this is not guaranteed, you should add error checking to handle this case.\n\nAlso, this code does"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven an input string composed solely of lowercase English letters, find the longest substring that occurs more than once in the input string. The two occurrences are allowed to partially overlap.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is a single line containing a string of lowercase letters. The string contains more than one character, but no more than $10^5$. At least one letter will appear at least twice.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line of output: the longest substring that occurs more than once in the input string. If there are multiple longest repeated substrings, print the one the would come first when the longest substrings are sorted in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nabcefgabc\nSample Output 1:\nabc\n\nSample Input 2:\nabcbabcba\nSample Output 2:\nabcba\n\nSample Input 3:\naaaa\nSample Output 3:\naaa\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
