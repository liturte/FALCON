That is, the values \u200bof the elements \u200bdo not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array $a$ has exactly $2^n - 1$ different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array $a$.\n\nThe next line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint exactly one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of good subsequences taken modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n5\n2 2 1 22 14\n\nOutput\n13\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: $\\{1\\}$, $\\{1, 2\\}$, $\\{2\\}$\n\nIn the second example, the possible good subsequences are: $\\{2\\}$, $\\{2, 2\\}$, $\\{2, 22\\}$, $\\{2, 14\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{2, 22\\}$, $\\{2, 14\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{1, 22\\}$, $\\{1, 14\\}$, $\\{22\\}$, $\\{22, 14\\}$, $\\{14\\}$.\n\nNote, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
