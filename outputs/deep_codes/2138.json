Your task is to construct an undirected graph such that:\n\n  there are exactly d_{n} + 1 vertices;  there are no self-loops;  there are no multiple edges;  there are no more than 10^6 edges;  its degree set is equal to d. \n\nVertices should be numbered 1 through (d_{n} + 1).\n\nDegree sequence is an array a with length equal to the number of vertices in a graph such that a_{i} is the number of vertices adjacent to i-th vertex.\n\nDegree set is a sorted in increasing order sequence of all distinct values from the degree sequence.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists such a graph that all the conditions hold, and it contains no more than 10^6 edges.\n\nPrint the resulting graph.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300) \u2014 the size of the degree set.\n\nThe second line contains n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{n} (1 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 1000, d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_{n}) \u2014 the degree set.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print one integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of edges in the resulting graph. It is guaranteed that there exists such a graph that all the conditions hold and it contains no more than 10^6 edges.\n\nEach of the next m lines should contain two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 \u2264 v_{i}, u_{i} \u2264 d_{n} + 1) \u2014 the description of the i-th edge.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 4\n\nOutput\n8\n3 1\n4 2\n4 5\n2 5\n5 1\n3 2\n2 1\n5 3\n\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
