It iterates over all possible combinations of W and H for the boxes, calculates the number of empty squares for each combination, and keeps track of the minimum number of empty squares. The time complexity of this program is O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\nThe function min_empty_squares takes an integer n as input,", "import math\n\ndef smallest_empty_squares(N):\n    # Initialize the number of empty squares to 0\n    empty_squares = 0\n\n    # Loop from 1 to sqrt(N)\n    for i in range(1, math.isqrt(N) + 1):\n        # If N is divisible by i, increment the number of empty squares\n        if N % i == 0:\n            empty_squares += 1\n\n    # Return the number of empty squares\n    return empty_squares\n\n# Read the number of widgets from input\nN = int(input())\n\n# Print the smallest number of empty squares\nprint(smallest_empty_squares(N))\n\nThis code uses the property that the number of empty squares is equal to the number of divisors of N. It iterates from 1 to sqrt(N) and increments the count of empty squares whenever N is divisible by the current number.

This formula is derived from the fact that the number of squares of size `i` in a rectangle of size `n` is `floor(sqrt(n/i)) - ceil(n/(i+1))`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop runs up to the square root of `n`.

It iterates through possible values of W and H, checks if the current H*W is larger than the previous minimum and if it is, updates the minimum. The condition `H >= 2*W` ensures that the box size is within the required range. The number of empty squares is calculated as `H*W - n`, where `n` is the number of widgets", "def min_empty_squares(n):\n    i = 1\n    while True:\n        if n <= 2*i*i:\n            return i-1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(min_empty_squares(n))\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the possible box sizes starting from 1 and checking if the number of widgets fits within each box size. The condition `n <= 2*i*i` checks if the number of widgets fits within the box size. If it does, the function returns the previous box size as the minimum number of empty squares. If it doesn't, it increments the box size and continues the loop.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the widgets can be rotated to fit into the boxes. If the widgets cannot be rotated, the problem becomes more complex and the solution would need to take that into account.\n\nAlso, this solution is not optimal for large inputs.
