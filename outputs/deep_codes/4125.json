The i-th city is located at coordinate x_i.\nYour objective is to visit all these cities at least once.\nIn order to do so, you will first set a positive integer D.\nThen, you will depart from coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 below, as many times as you like:\n - Move 1: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y + D.\n - Move 2: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y - D.\nFind the maximum value of D that enables you to visit all the cities.\nHere, to visit a city is to travel to the coordinate where that city is located.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq X \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^9\n - x_i are all different.\n - x_1, x_2, ..., x_N \\neq X\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\nx_1 x_2 ... x_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum value of D that enables you to visit all the cities.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 3\n1 7 11\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nSetting D = 2 enables you to visit all the cities as follows, and this is the maximum value of such D.\n - Perform Move 2 to travel to coordinate 1.\n - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 3.\n - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 5.\n - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 7.\n - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 9.\n - Perform Move 1 to travel to coordinate 11.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
