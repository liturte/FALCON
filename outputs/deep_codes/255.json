However, the partners' dancing skill in each pair must differ by at most one.\n\nFor each boy, we know his dancing skills. Similarly, for each girl we know her dancing skills. Write a code that can determine the largest possible number of pairs that can be formed from n boys and m girls.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of boys. The second line contains sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100), where a_{i} is the i-th boy's dancing skill.\n\nSimilarly, the third line contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of girls. The fourth line contains sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 \u2264 b_{j} \u2264 100), where b_{j} is the j-th girl's dancing skill.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the required maximum possible number of pairs.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 4 6 2\n5\n5 1 5 7 9\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4\n10 11 12 13\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
