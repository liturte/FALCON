There are many ways of constructing really big numbers known to humankind, for instance: \n - Exponentiation: $42^{2016} = \\underbrace{42 \\cdot 42 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 42}_{2016\\text { times}}$.\n - Factorials: $2016! = 2016 \\cdot 2015 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$.\n\nIn this problem we look at their lesser-known love-child the exponial, which is an operation defined for all positive integers $n$ as\\[ \\operatorname {exponial}(n) = n^{(n-1)^{(n-2)^{\\cdots ^{2^{1}}}}}. \\]\n\nFor example, $\\operatorname {exponial}(1) = 1$ and $\\operatorname {exponial}(5) = 5^{4^{3^{2^1}}} \\approx 6.206 \\cdot 10^{183230}$ which is already pretty big. Note that exponentiation is right-associative: $a^{b^c} = a^{(b^c)}$.\n\nSince the exponials are really big, they can be a bit unwieldy to work with. Therefore we would like you to write a program which computes $\\operatorname {exponial}(n) \\bmod m$ (the remainder of $\\operatorname {exponial}(n)$ when dividing by $m$).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$) and $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10^9$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, the value of $\\operatorname {exponial}(n) \\bmod m$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 42\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 123456789\nSample Output 2:\n16317634\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
