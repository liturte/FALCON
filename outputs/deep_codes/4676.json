{"4676": {"code": ["O = input()\nE = input()\n\npassword = [\"\"] * (len(O) + len(E))\npassword[::2] = O\npassword[1::2] = E\n\nprint(\"\".join(password))\n\n\nThis Python code reads two strings O and E, and then constructs the original password by alternating characters from O and E. The resulting password is then printed.\n\nFor example, if O = \"xyz\" and E = \"abc\", the original password will be \"xaybzc\".\n\nThe code uses list slicing to alternate the characters from O and E, and the join function to convert the list of characters back into a string.\n\nNote that the len(O) + len(E) is used to ensure the list has enough space for all the characters.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where", "import sys\n\nO = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nE = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nP = [\"\"] * (len(O) + len(E))\nP[::2] = O\nP[1::2] = E\n\nprint(\"\".join(P))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem is to merge two strings, O and E, into one string P.\nThe characters in P are distributed in such a way that characters at the odd-numbered positions are from string O and characters at the even-numbered positions are from string E.\nThis can be achieved by using Python's list slicing.\nIn Python, the indexing starts from 0, so every even index is an odd-numbered position and every odd index is an even-numbered position.\nSo, we can use P[", "O = input()\nE = input()\npassword = [\"\"] * (len(O) + len(E))\npassword[::2] = O\npassword[1::2] = E\nprint(\"\".join(password))\n\n\nThis solution works by creating a list of empty strings with the length of the sum of the lengths of O and E. It then fills the even-numbered positions of the list with the characters in O and the odd-numbered positions with the characters in E. Finally, it joins the list into a string and prints it.\n\nThis solution assumes that the lengths of O and E are the same or O is one character longer than E. If this is not the case, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nNote: This solution uses Python's list slicing feature to fill the list with the characters from O and E. The syntax `[::2", "O = input()\nE = input()\n\npassword = [''] * (len(O) + len(E))\npassword[::2] = O\npassword[1::2] = E\n\nprint(''.join(password))\n\n\nThis code works by first initializing a list of empty strings of the appropriate length. It then populates the list with the characters from O at the even-numbered positions and the characters from E at the odd-numbered positions. Finally, it joins the list into a single string and prints it.\n\nThe '::2' and '1::2' in the code are used to select every second element from the list, starting from the first and the second respectively.\n\nThe 'input()' function is used to read the strings O and E from the standard input.\n\nThe 'join()' function is used to concatenate the elements of the list", "O = input()\nE = input()\nP = [''] * (len(O) + len(E))\nP[::2] = O\nP[1::2] = E\nprint(''.join(P))\n\n\nThis Python code reads two strings O and E, then creates a new string P of the same length as the longer of O and E. It fills P with the characters from O at even indices and with the characters from E at odd indices. Finally, it prints P.\n\nThis code assumes that the characters in O correspond to the characters in E at the same relative positions. If the lengths of O and E are not the same, the extra character will be placed at the end.\n\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the longer of O and E. The space complexity is also O(n).\n\nThe code works by"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nSnuke signed up for a new website which holds programming competitions.\nHe worried that he might forget his password, and he took notes of it.\nSince directly recording his password would cause him trouble if stolen,\nhe took two notes: one contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions, and the other contains the characters at the even-numbered positions.\nYou are given two strings O and E. O contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions retaining their relative order, and E contains the characters at the even-numbered positions retaining their relative order.\nRestore the original password.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - O and E consists of lowercase English letters (a - z).\n - 1 \\leq |O|,|E| \\leq 50\n - |O| - |E| is either 0 or 1.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nO\nE\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the original password.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nxyz\nabc\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nxaybzc\n\nThe original password is xaybzc. Extracting the characters at the odd-numbered positions results in xyz, and extracting the characters at the even-numbered positions results in abc.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
