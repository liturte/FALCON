Print the number of special n \u00d7 n matrices, such that the first m rows coincide with the given ones.\n\nAs the required value can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the value by the given number mod.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m, mod (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, 2 \u2264 mod \u2264 10^9). Then m lines follow, each of them contains n characters \u2014 the first rows of the required special matrices. Each of these lines contains exactly two characters '1', the rest characters are '0'. Each column of the given m \u00d7 n table contains at most two numbers one.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the remainder after dividing the required value by number mod.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1 1000\n011\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 4 100500\n0110\n1010\n0101\n1001\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test the required matrices are: \n\n011\n\n101\n\n110\n\n\n\n011\n\n110\n\n101\n\n\n\nIn the second test the required matrix is already fully given, so the answer is 1.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
