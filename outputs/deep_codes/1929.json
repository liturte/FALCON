As the prison can't accommodate all of them, the city mayor has decided to transfer c of the prisoners to a prison located in another city.\n\nFor this reason, he made the n prisoners to stand in a line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of the crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe his/her crime was.\n\nThen, the mayor told you to choose the c prisoners, who will be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They are,\n\n  The chosen c prisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners.  Any of the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater then t. Because, that will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to take the risk of his running away during the transfer. \n\nFind the number of ways you can choose the c prisoners.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input will contain three space separated integers n\u00a0(1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5), t\u00a0(0 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9) and c\u00a0(1 \u2264 c \u2264 n). The next line will contain n space separated integers, the i^{th} integer is the severity i^{th} prisoner's crime. The value of crime severities will be non-negative and will not exceed 10^9. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways you can choose the c prisoners.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3 3\n2 3 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 1 1\n2\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n11 4 2\n2 2 0 7 3 2 2 4 9 1 4\n\nOutput\n6\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
