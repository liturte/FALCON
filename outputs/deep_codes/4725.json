It does this by subtracting the maximum count of any letter from the total length of the string. The `set` function is used to get all unique letters in the string, and `count` is used to count the occurrences of each letter. The", "def min_erase(s):\n    return len(s) - max(s.count(ch) for ch in set(s))\n\ns = input()\nprint(min_erase(s))\n\n\nThis code works by counting the frequency of each character in the string and then subtracting the maximum count from the total length of the string. The result is the minimum number of characters that need to be erased to make the string simplicity at most 2.\n\nThis is because the maximum count represents the most common character in the string, and subtracting this count from the total length gives the", "def simplify_string(s):\n    return len(s) - max(s.count(c) for c in set(s))\n\nprint(simplify_string(input()))\n\n\nThis Python program solves the problem by counting the frequency of each character in the input string and subtracting the maximum frequency from the total length of the string. The result is the minimum number of letters that must be erased to simplify the string.\n\nThe function `simplify_string` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of letters that must be erased to simplify the string.", "def min_erase(s):\n    return len(s) - max(s.count(ch) for ch in set(s))\n\nprint(min_erase(input()))\n\n\nThis solution works by counting the frequency of each character in the string and then subtracting the maximum frequency from the total length of the string. This gives the minimum number of characters that need to be erased to get a string with at most 2 distinct characters.\n\nThe `set(s)` function is used to get all distinct characters in the string, and the `s.count(ch)` function"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nFor a string of letters, define the Simplicity of the string to be the number of distinct letters in the string. For example, the string string has simplicity $6$, and the string letter has simplicity $4$.\n\nYou like strings which have simplicity either $1$ or $2$. Your friend has given you a string and you want to turn it into a string that you like. You have a magic eraser which will delete one letter from any string. Compute the minimum number of letters you must erase in order to turn the string into a string with simplicity at most $2$.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input will consist of a line with a single string consisting of at least $1$ and at most $100$ lowercase letters \u2018a\u2019-\u2018z\u2019.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, indicating the minimum number letters you need to erase in order to give the string a simplicity of $1$ or $2$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nstring\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\nletter\nSample Output 2:\n2\n\nSample Input 3:\naaaaaa\nSample Output 3:\n0\n\nSample Input 4:\nuncopyrightable\nSample Output 4:\n13\n\nSample Input 5:\nambidextrously\nSample Output 5:\n12\n\nSample Input 6:\nassesses\nSample Output 6:\n1\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
