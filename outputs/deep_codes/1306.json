Peter wants all numbers in the sequence to equal h. He can perform the operation of \"adding one on the segment [l, r]\": add one to all elements of the sequence with indices from l to r (inclusive). At that, Peter never chooses any element as the beginning of the segment twice. Similarly, Peter never chooses any element as the end of the segment twice. In other words, for any two segments [l_1, r_1] and [l_2, r_2], where Peter added one, the following inequalities hold: l_1 \u2260 l_2 and r_1 \u2260 r_2.\n\nHow many distinct ways are there to make all numbers in the sequence equal h? Print this number of ways modulo 1000000007\u00a0(10^9 + 7). Two ways are considered distinct if one of them has a segment that isn't in the other way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, h (1 \u2264 n, h \u2264 2000). The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007\u00a0(10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 3\n3 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
