The average value is then equal to the average value of Kirill's values, and there are only two equal measurements.\n\nIn the second example Anya should write two values 100 and one value 101 (in any order), because it is the only possibility to make the average be the equal to the average of Kirill's values. Thus, all three measurements are equal.\n\nIn the third example the number of equal measurements is 5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
