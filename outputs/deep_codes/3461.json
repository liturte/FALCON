If the NASA hearing does end at time\u00a0$5$ you will immediately head to the oil and gas exploration hearing, and there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that hearing will end at time\u00a0$6$, allowing you to make yet a third hearing (about hurricane recovery efforts). If the NASA hearing instead ends at time\u00a0$6$, you will go straight to the hurricane hearing.\n\nBy this strategy you will attend $3$ hearings 12.5% of the time and $2$ hearings the other 87.5% of the time, and thus expected value of $2.125$. Note that if you were to start by attending the social media and elections hearing, you might optimistically make four hearings. However, a careful analysis will demonstrate that if you attend the first hearing, your optimal expected value is only $2.10714$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with an integer $n$ that designates the total number of scheduled hearings ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4$). Following that are $n$ lines, each containing three integers $s$, $a$, and $b$, respectively representing the start time, minimum length, and maximum length of a hearing, such that $1 \\leq s \\leq 10^6$ and $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 10^6$. The hearings will be listed in nondecreasing order of their start times.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the expected number of hearings of an optimal strategy. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-3}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 1 7\n3 2 3\n5 1 4\n6 10 10\nSample Output:\n2.125\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
