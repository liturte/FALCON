For example, the sequence BDF is a subsequence of ABCDEF. A substring of a string is a continuous subsequence of the string. For example, BCD is a substring of ABCDEF.\n\nYou are given two strings s_1, s_2 and another string called virus. Your task is to find the longest common subsequence of s_1 and s_2, such that it doesn't contain virus as a substring.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains three strings in three separate lines: s_1, s_2 and virus (1 \u2264 |s_1|, |s_2|, |virus| \u2264 100). Each string consists only of uppercase English letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the longest common subsequence of s_1 and s_2 without virus as a substring. If there are multiple answers, any of them will be accepted. \n\nIf there is no valid common subsequence, output 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nAJKEQSLOBSROFGZ\nOVGURWZLWVLUXTH\nOZ\n\nOutput\nORZ\n\nInput\nAA\nA\nA\n\nOutput\n0\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
