They have n chests with coins, the chests are numbered with integers from 1 to n. Chest number i has a_{i} coins. \n\nPolycarpus and Vasily move in turns. Polycarpus moves first. During a move a player is allowed to choose a positive integer x (2\u00b7x + 1 \u2264 n) and take a coin from each chest with numbers x, 2\u00b7x, 2\u00b7x + 1. It may turn out that some chest has no coins, in this case the player doesn't take a coin from this chest. The game finishes when all chests get emptied.\n\nPolycarpus isn't a greedy scrooge. Polycarpys is a lazy slob. So he wonders in what minimum number of moves the game can finish. Help Polycarpus, determine the minimum number of moves in which the game can finish. Note that Polycarpus counts not only his moves, he also counts Vasily's moves.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of chests with coins. The second line contains a sequence of space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000), where a_{i} is the number of coins in the chest number i at the beginning of the game.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to finish the game. If no sequence of turns leads to finishing the game, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case there isn't a single move that can be made. That's why the players won't be able to empty the chests.\n\nIn the second sample there is only one possible move x = 1. This move should be repeated at least 3 times to empty the third chest.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
