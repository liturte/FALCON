The i-th monster, standing at the coordinate X_i, has the health of H_i.\nSilver Fox can use bombs to attack the monsters.\nUsing a bomb at the coordinate x decreases the healths of all monsters between the coordinates x-D and x+D (inclusive) by A.\nThere is no way other than bombs to decrease the monster's health.\nSilver Fox wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.\nFind the minimum number of bombs needed to win.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 0 \\leq D \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq A \\leq 10^9\n - 0 \\leq X_i \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^9\n - X_i are distinct.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN D A\nX_1 H_1\n:\nX_N H_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of bombs needed to win.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 3 2\n1 2\n5 4\n9 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nFirst, let us use a bomb at the coordinate 4 to decrease the first and second monsters' health by 2.\nThen, use a bomb at the coordinate 6 to decrease the second and third monsters' health by 2.\nNow, all the monsters' healths are 0.\nWe cannot make all the monsters' health drop to 0 or below with just one bomb.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
