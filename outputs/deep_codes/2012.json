{"2012": {"code": ["n", "n", "def", "def", "n"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nStepan had a favorite string s which consisted of the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. \n\nAfter graduation, he decided to remember it, but it was a long time ago, so he can't now remember it. But Stepan remembers some information about the string, namely the sequence of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}, where n equals the length of the string s, and c_{i} equals the number of substrings in the string s with the length i, consisting of the same letters. The substring is a sequence of consecutive characters in the string s.\n\nFor example, if the Stepan's favorite string is equal to \"tttesst\", the sequence c looks like: c = [7, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nStepan asks you to help to repair his favorite string s according to the given sequence c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the length of the Stepan's favorite string.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (0 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 2000), where c_{i} equals the number of substrings of the string s with the length i, consisting of the same letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input data is such that the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the repaired Stepan's favorite string. If there are several answers, it is allowed to print any of them. The string should contain only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n6 3 1 0 0 0\n\nOutput\nkkrrrq\nInput\n4\n4 0 0 0\n\nOutput\nabcd\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test Stepan's favorite string, for example, can be the string \"kkrrrq\", because it contains 6 substrings with the length 1, consisting of identical letters (they begin in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), 3 substrings with the length 2, consisting of identical letters (they begin in positions 1, 3 and 4), and 1 substring with the length 3, consisting of identical letters (it begins in the position 3).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
