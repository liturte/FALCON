The announcer has informed the crowd that their scoreboard is broken, so they don\u2019t have a way to keep track of all the scores. As a seasoned programmer, you feel you can whip up a program that can keep track of the names of the players and the amount of points they\u2019ve scored, announcing the winner(s) at the end of the contest.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers: the number of participants $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100000$); the minimum number $p$ of points required to win the contest ($1 \\le p \\le 10001$); and $m$, the number of lines with player names and points ($1 \\le m \\le 200000$). The next $n$ lines contain the names of the participants, each mentioned exactly once. Each name consist of no more than $20$ alphanumerical characters. The remaining $m$ lines each contain the name of a participant, followed by how many points they scored ($1$, $2$, or $3$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the names of those participants who reached the minimum required score, one per line! Output \u201c<Winner> wins!\u201d for each winner. Output the winners in the order in which they\u2019ve reached the required score. If no one reaches the minimum required score, output \u201cNo winner!\u201d (including the exclamation mark!).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 10 13\nJohn\nKelly\nGeorge\nKelly 1\nGeorge 2\nKelly 1\nJohn 2\nGeorge 1\nJohn 3\nKelly 3\nKelly 1\nGeorge 3\nGeorge 1\nJohn 3\nGeorge 3\nKelly 1\nSample Output 1:\nGeorge wins!\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 10 13\nBob\nNina\nJess\nTim\nNina 2\nBob 2\nNina 1\nJess 3\nBob 2\nJess 2\nNina 1\nJess 2\nNina 3\nBob 1\nNina 3\nJess 3\nBob 2\nSample Output 2:\nNina wins!\nJess wins!\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
