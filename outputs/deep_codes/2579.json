Each potion is characterized by two integers\u00a0\u2014 amount of experience and cost. The efficiency of a potion is the ratio of the amount of experience to the cost. Efficiency may be a non-integer number.\n\nFor each two integer numbers a and b such that l \u2264 a \u2264 r and x \u2264 b \u2264 y there is a potion with experience a and cost b in the store (that is, there are (r - l + 1)\u00b7(y - x + 1) potions).\n\nKirill wants to buy a potion which has efficiency k. Will he be able to do this?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst string contains five integer numbers l, r, x, y, k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^7, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 y \u2264 10^7, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^7).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" without quotes if a potion with efficiency exactly k can be bought in the store and \"NO\" without quotes otherwise.\n\nYou can output each of the letters in any register.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 10 1 10 1\n\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n1 5 6 10 1\n\nOutput\nNO\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
