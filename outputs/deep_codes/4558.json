However, if this results in a negative number (which would mean all the sand was consumed), the program should print 0 instead.\n\n# So, the solution is:\n\n# Read the initial amount of sand (X) and the time (t) from the input.\n# Subtract t from X to get the final amount of sand.\n# If the final amount is negative, set it to 0.\n# Print the final amount of sand.\n\n# This solution is implemented in Python as follows:\n\nX, t = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X - t if X - t >= 0 else 0)\n\n# This solution works because the amount of", "X, t = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X - t if X - t >= 0 else 0)\n\n\nThis code will take two integers as input (X and t). It will then subtract t from X and print the result. If the result is less than 0, it will print 0 instead.\n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that the sand will keep falling evenly for all the time, which means there will be no sand left over. If the sand starts to accumulate at the top, the problem would require a different solution.\n\nThis solution also assumes that the rate of sand falling from the top is constant and does not change. If the rate of falling sand changes, the problem would need to be modified to account for that.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it will take the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), which means it will use the same amount of memory regardless of the size of the input.", "X, t = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X - t if X - t > 0 else 0)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is very straightforward. It just subtracts the time from the initial amount of sand to find the remaining sand. If the result is negative, it means all the sand has already been consumed, so it returns 0.\n\nFor example, if X=100 and t=17, the remaining sand is 100 - 17 = 83. If X=100 and t=200, there is no sand left, so it returns 0.\n\nThis solution works because the sand falls down from the upper bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second, so the amount of sand in the upper bulb decreases by the time elapsed.\n'''\n\nX, t = map(int, input().split())\nprint(X - t if X - t > 0 else 0)\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution is very straightforward.

If the amount of sand remaining is less than zero, it prints zero.\n\nThis is because the sand cannot be negative.\n\nThis solution assumes that the sand is evenly distributed among the bulbs, so there's no need to account for the lower bulb.\n\nThis solution is based on the fact that the sand drops from the upper bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second. So, the amount of sand remaining after t seconds is the initial amount of sand minus the time.

If the result is negative (i.e., t > X), the code prints 0, since there will be no sand left.\n\nThis solution assumes that the sand is evenly distributed over time.
