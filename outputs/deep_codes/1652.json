It first creates a string T which is the repeated string \"dreameraserdream\" for as many times as possible, and then appends the remaining characters of S. Then it checks if T is the reverse of S. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The reason this works is that by appending the strings in reverse order, we can ensure that we can always append the strings in the order of dreameraserdream to obtain S.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of S. The space complexity is also O(n), because we are storing the string T.\n\nPlease note that the string \"dreameraserdream\" is chosen to be the repeated string in order to maximize the number of times it can be appended to form S. This is because the length of this string is 14, and by repeating it as many", "def solve():\n    S = input()\n    T = 'dreameraserdream'*len(S)\n    if S in T:\n        print('YES')\n    else:\n        print('NO')\n\nsolve()\n\n\nThis solution works by creating a string T that is a repetition of 'dreameraserdream' as many times as the length of S. Then it checks if S is a substring of T. If it is, it means it is possible to obtain S by appending the appropriate strings to T, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.", "import sys\n\nS = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\nT = \"dreameraserdreameraserdreameraserdreameraserdreameraser\"\n\nif S in T:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThis code checks if the string S is a substring of T by using the in operator. If S is a substring of T, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\". The string T is constructed by repeating the string \"dreameraserdreameraserdreameraserdreameraserdreameraser\" four times. This is done to ensure that all possible permutations of the words \"dream\", \"dreamer\", \"erase\", and \"eraser\" are included.\n\nThis solution works because the problem is asking if it's possible to form the string S by appending the words \"dream\", \"dreamer\", \"erase\", and \"eraser\" to an empty string in any order. This is the same as asking if S is a substring of the string T.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of S. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of T.\n\nThis code assumes that the input string S", "S = input()\nT = \"\"\nwhile len(S) > 0:\n    if S.endswith('dreamer'):\n        T += 'dreamer'\n        S = S[:-7]\n    elif S.endswith('dream'):\n        T += 'dream'\n        S = S[:-5]\n    elif S.endswith('eraser'):\n        T += 'eraser'\n        S = S[:-6]\n    elif S.endswith('erase'):\n        T += 'erase'\n        S = S[:-5]\n    else:\n        print('NO')\n        exit()\nprint('YES')\n\n\nThis code first reads the input string S. Then it initializes an empty string T. It enters a while loop that continues until S is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if S ends with 'dreamer', 'dream', 'eraser', or 'erase' and appends the corresponding string to T and removes the last characters of S accordingly. If S does not end with any of these strings, it prints 'NO' and exits the program. If S is eventually empty, it prints 'YES'.\n\nNote: The code uses the `endswith` method of the string"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.\nAnother string T is initially empty.\nDetermine whether it is possible to obtain S = T by performing the following operation an arbitrary number of times:\n - Append one of the following at the end of T: dream, dreamer, erase and eraser.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266|S|\u226610^5\n - S consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to obtain S = T, print YES.
