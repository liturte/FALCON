There are $n$ students under your supervision, the programming skill of the $i$-th student is $a_i$.\n\nYou have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than $5$.\n\nYour task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is a programming skill of the $i$-th student.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 10 17 12 15 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n10\n1337 1337 1337 1337 1337 1337 1337 1337 1337 1337\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n6\n1 1000 10000 10 100 1000000000\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can create a team with skills $[12, 17, 15]$.\n\nIn the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.\n\nIn the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
