In one move, you can either multiply $n$ by two or divide $n$ by $6$ (if it is divisible by $6$ without the remainder).\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $n$ or determine if it's impossible to do that.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. \n\nThe only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $1$ from $n$ if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain $1$ from $n$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n1\n2\n3\n12\n12345\n15116544\n387420489\n\nOutput\n0\n-1\n2\n-1\n-1\n12\n36\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the sixth test case of the example. The answer can be obtained by the following sequence of moves from the given integer $15116544$:\n\n  Divide by $6$ and get $2519424$;  divide by $6$ and get $419904$;  divide by $6$ and get $69984$;  divide by $6$ and get $11664$;  multiply by $2$ and get $23328$;  divide by $6$ and get $3888$;  divide by $6$ and get $648$;  divide by $6$ and get $108$;  multiply by $2$ and get $216$;  divide by $6$ and get $36$;  divide by $6$ and get $6$;  divide by $6$ and get $1$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
