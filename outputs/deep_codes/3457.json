You start at the origin and your goal is to hop to the lattice point $(N, N)$. A hop consists of going from lattice point $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 < x_2$ and $y_1 < y_2$.\n\nYou dislike making small hops though. You\u2019ve decided that for every hop you make between two lattice points, the x-coordinate must increase by at least $X$ and the y-coordinate must increase by at least $Y$.\n\nCompute the number of distinct paths you can take between $(0, 0)$ and $(N, N)$ that respect the above constraints. Two paths are distinct if there is some lattice point that you visit in one path which you don\u2019t visit in the other.\n\nHint: The output involves arithmetic mod $10^9+7$. Note that with $p$ a prime like $10^9+7$, and $x$ an integer not equal to $0$ mod $p$, then $x(x^{p-2})$ mod $p$ equals $1$ mod $p$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a line of three integers, $N$ $X$ $Y$. You may assume $1 \\le X, Y \\le N \\le 10^{6}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe number of distinct paths you can take between the two lattice points can be very large. Hence output this number modulo 1\u2009000\u2009000\u2009007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 1 1\nSample Output:\n2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
