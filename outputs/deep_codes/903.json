{"903": {"code": ["import", "from", "from", "import", "from"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers, where $n$ is odd. You can make the following operation with it:  Choose one of the elements of the array (for example $a_i$) and increase it by $1$ (that is, replace it with $a_i + 1$). \n\nYou want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most $k$ operations.\n\nThe median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array $[1, 5, 2, 3, 5]$ is $3$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n$ is odd, $1 \\le k \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array and the largest number of operations you can make.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible median after the operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 3 5\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n5 5\n1 2 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n7 7\n4 1 2 4 3 4 4\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can increase the second element twice. Than array will be $[1, 5, 5]$ and it's median is $5$.\n\nIn the second example, it is optimal to increase the second number and than increase third and fifth. This way the answer is $3$.\n\nIn the third example, you can make four operations: increase first, fourth, sixth, seventh element. This way the array will be $[5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5]$ and the median will be $5$.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
