Otherwise, it prints 'TBD'.\n\nNote: The `strptime` function is used to convert the string to a datetime object, and the `datetime` class is used to create a datetime object representing April 30, 2019.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input date is always in the yyyy/mm/dd format. If this is not the case, you will need to add error checking to handle invalid input.\n\nAlso note that this code uses the datetime module, which is a standard Python library for working with dates and times.", "from datetime import datetime\n\nS = input()\n\nif datetime.strptime(S, \"%Y/%m/%d\") <= datetime(2019, 4, 30):\n    print(\"Heisei\")\nelse:\n    print(\"TBD\")\n\nThis code works by first importing the datetime module. It then takes the input date in the format yyyy/mm/dd and converts it into a datetime object. If this datetime object is less than or equal to the datetime object for April 30, 2019, it prints \"Heisei\". Otherwise, it prints \"TBD\".\n\nThe strptime function is used to convert the string into a datetime object, and the %Y, %m, and %d format codes are used to specify the format of the input string. The datetime function is used to create a datetime object for April 30, 2019.\n\nThe code uses the comparison operator <= to compare the two datetime objects. If the input date is not later than April 30, 2019, the condition is True and \"Heisei\" is printed. Otherwise, the condition is False and \"T", "import sys\n\nS = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n\nif S <= \"2019/04/30\":\n    print(\"Heisei\")\nelse:\n    print(\"TBD\")\n\n\nThis code reads a line from the standard input, removes any trailing newline character, and stores it in the variable S. It then compares S to the string \"2019/04/30\". If S is less than or equal to this string, it prints \"Heisei\". Otherwise, it prints \"TBD\".\n\nThis code assumes that the input is always in the correct format and that the input date is not later than April 30, 2019.

The comparison is done lexicographically, which means that it compares the strings character by character.\n\nIn this case, '2019/04/30' is lexicographically smaller than any date that is not later than it. Therefore, if the input date is not later than '2019/04/30', it will be lexicographically smaller or equal to it, and the program will print 'Heisei'. Otherwise, it will be lexicographically larger than '2019/04/30', and the program will print 'TBD'.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input date is always valid and in the correct format.

This works because the format of the date strings is `yyyy/mm/dd`, and in this format, the date is lexicographically ordered.\n\nThe `strip()` function is used to remove the newline character that is included when reading from the standard input.\n\nThe `sys.stdin.readline()` function is used to read the date from the standard input.\n\nThe `print()` function is used to print the result.\n\nThe `if`-`else` statement is used to check the date and print the appropriate message.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou are given a string S as input.
