It was possible to reach any city from any other city, via intermediate cities if necessary.\n - Different roads may have had different lengths, but all the lengths were positive integers.\nSnuke the archeologist found a table with N rows and N columns, A, in the ruin of Takahashi Kingdom.\nHe thought that it represented the shortest distances between the cities along the roads in the kingdom.\nDetermine whether there exists a road network such that for each u and v, the integer A_{u, v} at the u-th row and v-th column of A is equal to the length of the shortest path from City u to City v.\nIf such a network exist, find the shortest possible total length of the roads.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 300\n - If i \u2260 j, 1 \\leq A_{i, j} = A_{j, i} \\leq 10^9.\n - A_{i, i} = 0\n\n-----Inputs-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N}\nA_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N}\n...\nA_{N, 1} A_{N, 2} ... A_{N, N}\n\n-----Outputs-----\nIf there exists no network that satisfies the condition, print -1.\nIf it exists, print the shortest possible total length of the roads.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n0 1 3\n1 0 2\n3 2 0\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nThe network below satisfies the condition:\n - City 1 and City 2 is connected by a road of length 1.\n - City 2 and City 3 is connected by a road of length 2.\n - City 3 and City 1 is not connected by a road.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
