Find the lexicographically smallest string t of length k, such that its set of letters is a subset of the set of letters of s and s is lexicographically smaller than t.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\nNote that the set of letters is a set, not a multiset. For example, the set of letters of abadaba is {a, b, d}.\n\nString p is lexicographically smaller than string q, if p is a prefix of q, is not equal to q or there exists i, such that p_{i} < q_{i} and for all j < i it is satisfied that p_{j} = q_{j}. For example, abc is lexicographically smaller than abcd , abd is lexicographically smaller than abec, afa is not lexicographically smaller than ab and a is not lexicographically smaller than a.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains two space separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of s and the required length of t.\n\nThe second line of input contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the string t conforming to the requirements above.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\nabc\n\nOutput\naca\n\nInput\n3 2\nabc\n\nOutput\nac\n\nInput\n3 3\nayy\n\nOutput\nyaa\n\nInput\n2 3\nba\n\nOutput\nbaa\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the list of strings t of length 3, such that the set of letters of t is a subset of letters of s is as follows: aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, .... Among them, those are lexicographically greater than abc: aca, acb, .... Out of those the lexicographically smallest is aca.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
