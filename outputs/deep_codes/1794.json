There are n train stations in the city, and at the i-th station it's possible to buy only tickets to stations from i + 1 to a_{i} inclusive. No tickets are sold at the last station.\n\nLet \u03c1_{i}, j be the minimum number of tickets one needs to buy in order to get from stations i to station j. As Vasya is fond of different useless statistic he asks you to compute the sum of all values \u03c1_{i}, j among all pairs 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of stations.\n\nThe second line contains n - 1 integer a_{i} (i + 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n), the i-th of them means that at the i-th station one may buy tickets to each station from i + 1 to a_{i} inclusive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the sum of \u03c1_{i}, j among all pairs of 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n4 4 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n5\n2 3 5 5\n\nOutput\n17\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample it's possible to get from any station to any other (with greater index) using only one ticket. The total number of pairs is 6, so the answer is also 6.\n\nConsider the second sample:   \u03c1_{1, 2} = 1  \u03c1_{1, 3} = 2  \u03c1_{1, 4} = 3  \u03c1_{1, 5} = 3  \u03c1_{2, 3} = 1  \u03c1_{2, 4} = 2  \u03c1_{2, 5} = 2  \u03c1_{3, 4} = 1  \u03c1_{3, 5} = 1  \u03c1_{4, 5} = 1 \n\nThus the answer equals 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
