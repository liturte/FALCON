The regular expression pattern `[789]{1}\\d{9}$` is used to check the validity of a mobile number.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- `[789]{1}` checks if the first digit is either 7, 8, or 9.\n- `\\d{9}$` checks if there are exactly 9 digits after the first digit. The `$` sign ensures that we're checking from the end of the string.\n\nSo, if the string matches this pattern, it's a valid mobile number and the program prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it's not a valid mobile number and the program prints \"NO\".\n\nThe solution runs in O(N) time where N is the number of inputs. It checks each input string once.\n\"\"\"", "import re\n\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    num = input()\n    if re.match(r'[789]{1}\\d{9}$', num):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe regular expression r'[789]{1}\\d{9}$' is used to match the pattern of a valid mobile number. \n\nHere's what each part of the regex means:\n- [789]{1}: This matches any one digit from 7, 8 or 9.\n- \\d{9}: This matches any digit (0-9) exactly 9 times.\n- $: This asserts the position at the end of the string.\n\nThe match function of the re module is used to search the string from the start (^) till the end ($) for the pattern. If the pattern is found, match() returns a match object, else it returns None. Therefore, the condition in the if statement checks if the input matches the pattern of a valid mobile number. If it does, \"YES\" is printed, else \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is", "import re\n\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    number = input()\n    if re.match(r'[789]\\d{9}$', number):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution uses the built-in Python library \"re\" for regular expressions. The function \"match()\" checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, as specified by the '^' symbol. The regular expression '[789]\\d{9}$' checks for a string that starts with 7, 8, or 9, followed by 9 more digits, and nothing else. The '$' symbol ensures that the string ends here. If the string matches this pattern, it is a valid mobile number, so the program prints \"YES\". If not, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThe program repeats this process for each line of input, allowing it to handle multiple numbers at once.\n\nPlease note that you should run this program in a Python environment to see the output.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Enter your code here.

The regular expression `'[7-9]\\d{9}$'` checks for a number starting with a digit between 7 and 9 (inclusive), followed by 9 digits. The `$` symbol ensures that the number ends at the end of the string. If the input matches this pattern, we print 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.\n\nThe number of inputs `n` is read from the input, and for each of these inputs, we check if it matches the regular expression. The result is printed on separate lines.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN.
