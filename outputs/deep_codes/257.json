The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \\left(x_i, y_i\\right), and its hardness is c_i.\nTakahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \\left(X, Y\\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \\times \\sqrt{\\left(X - x_i\\right)^2 + \\left(Y-y_i\\right)^2} seconds.\nTakahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 60\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq N\n - -1000 \\leq x_i , y_i \\leq 1000\n - \\left(x_i, y_i\\right) \\neq \\left(x_j, y_j\\right) \\left(i \\neq j \\right)\n - 1 \\leq c_i \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\nx_1 y_1 c_1\n\\vdots\nx_N y_N c_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\nIt will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 3\n-1 0 3\n0 0 3\n1 0 2\n1 1 40\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2.4\n\nIf we put the heat source at \\left(-0.2, 0\\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
