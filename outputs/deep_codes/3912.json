A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.\n\nYour task is to help Kolya and determine the minimum number of palindromes of equal lengths to cut s into, if it is allowed to rearrange letters in s before cuttings.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4\u00b710^5) \u2014 the length of string s.\n\nThe second line contains a string s of length n consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint to the first line an integer k \u2014 minimum number of palindromes into which you can cut a given string.\n\nPrint to the second line k strings \u2014 the palindromes themselves. Separate them by a space. You are allowed to print palindromes in arbitrary order. All of them should have the same length.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\naabaac\n\nOutput\n2\naba aca \nInput\n8\n0rTrT022\n\nOutput\n1\n02TrrT20 \nInput\n2\naA\n\nOutput\n2\na A\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
