{"4607": {"code": ["a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(a, b))\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input of a and b, and then printing the smaller of the two. This is because the number of Takahashi days in a given month is equal to the number of days in that month. Therefore, the number of Takahashi days in a given month is the smaller of a and b. The minimum number of Takahashi days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b is thus the smaller of a and b.", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(a, b))\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of Takahashi days in a month is equal to the number of Takahashi days in the shorter month. So we take the minimum of a and b. If a is 5 and b is 3, then there are 3 Takahashi days in the month, not 5. If a is 3 and b is 5, then there are 3 Takahashi days in the month, not 5.\n\nThe number of Takahashi days in a year is equal to the number of Takahashi days in the shorter year. So we take the minimum of a", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a < b:\n    a, b = b, a\n\nprint((a*(a+1)//2)*(a+1)//2)\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe number of Takahashi days is the number of ways to choose two numbers from the set {1, 2, ..., a} such that the two numbers are equal. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers: n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6. Since the two numbers must be equal, we take the square root of the result, which gives us a, and then multiply by a to get", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(a, b))\n\n\nThis solution works by taking the input and splitting it into two variables `a` and `b`. It then prints the smaller of the two variables, which is the number of Takahashi days in the given range.\n\nThis works because the number of Takahashi days is equal to the smaller of `a` and `b`, because for each day of the month, the day and the month are equal, and there are at most 31 days in a month.\n\nThe `map` function is used to convert the input into integers, and the `input().split()` function is used to split the input into two parts", "a, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(min(a, b))\n\n\nThis program reads two integers a and b from the input, and then prints the smaller one. This is because the number of Takahashi days in a certain month is equal to that month's number, and since Takahashi days can only be in the range from 1 to min(a, b), the answer is min(a, b).\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is always valid, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nNOTE: This solution is written in Python, but it can be easily translated into any other programming language."], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn AtCoder Kingdom, Gregorian calendar is used, and dates are written in the \"year-month-day\" order, or the \"month-day\" order without the year.\n\nFor example, May 3, 2018 is written as 2018-5-3, or 5-3 without the year.  \nIn this country, a date is called Takahashi when the month and the day are equal as numbers. For example, 5-5 is Takahashi.\n\nHow many days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b are Takahashi?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - a is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive).\n - b is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive).\n - 2018-a-b is a valid date in Gregorian calendar.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of days from 2018-1-1 through 2018-a-b that are Takahashi.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nThere are five days that are Takahashi: 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4 and 5-5.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
