In particular, it implies that the sum of $t$ over all $ans$ testcases should be equal to $n$.\n\nNote that the answer always exists due to $c_k \\ge 1$ (and therefore $c_1 \\ge 1$).\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 2 2 3\n4 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n1 2\n2 1 3\n1 2\n\nInput\n6 10\n5 8 1 10 8 7\n6 6 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n3 8 5 7\n3 10 8 1\n\nInput\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n5\n\nOutput\n1\n5 1 1 1 1 1\n\nInput\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1\n\nOutput\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there is no way to distribute the tests into less than $3$ testcases. The given answer satisfies the conditions: each of the testcases includes no more than $4$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $1$ and no more than $1$ array of sizes greater than or equal to $2$ and $3$.\n\nNote that there are multiple valid answers for this test. For example, testcases with sizes $[[2], [1, 2], [3]]$ would also be correct.\n\nHowever, testcases with sizes $[[1, 2], [2, 3]]$ would be incorrect because there are $2$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $2$ in the second testcase.\n\nNote the difference between the third and the fourth examples. You can include up to $5$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $1$ in the third example, so you can put all arrays into a single testcase. And you can have only up to $1$ array in the fourth example. Thus, every array should be included in a separate testcase.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n"}}
