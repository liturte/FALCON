Jeff can choose several cards and put them in a line so that he gets some number. What is the largest possible number divisible by 90 Jeff can make from the cards he's got?\n\nJeff must make the number without leading zero. At that, we assume that number 0 doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Jeff doesn't have to use all the cards.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3). The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (a_{i} = 0 or a_{i} = 5). Number a_{i} represents the digit that is written on the i-th card.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the maximum number, divisible by 90. If you can't make any divisible by 90 number from the cards, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n5 0 5 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n11\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5\n\nOutput\n5555555550\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test you can make only one number that is a multiple of 90 \u2014 0.\n\nIn the second test you can make number 5555555550, it is a multiple of 90.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
