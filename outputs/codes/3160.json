But before continuing his exciting journey, Gon decides to visit his home in \u2018While Island\u2019.\n\nAunt Mito is happy that Gon has become a Hunter and has visited home. But at the same time, she feels worried about Gon\u00a0\u2014 the life of a Hunter is challenging. Thus, she will not allow Gon to leave \u2018While Island\u2019, unless Gon is able to solve a puzzle prepared by aunt Mito.\n\nBut what puzzle should Mito give to Gon? Mito opened \u2018IMO 2019 Problems\u2019 and found the following problem:\n\nThe Bank of Bath issues coins with an $H$ on one side and a $T$ on the other. Prof. Tuy has $n$ of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly $k > 0$ coins showing $H$, then he turns over the $k$-th coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show $T$ and he stops. For example, if $n = 3$ the process starting with the configuration $THT$ would be: $THT \\rightarrow HHT \\rightarrow HTT \\rightarrow TTT$, which stops after three operations.\n\nShow that, for each initial configuration, Prof. Tuy stops after a finite number of operations.\n\n\u2018This problem is too easy\u2019\u00a0\u2014 Mito thought. \u2018Gon will be able to solve it in no time\u2019.\n\nAfter some more thinking, Mito changed the above problem to the following harder version:\n\nFor each initial configuration $C$, let $L(C)$ be the number of operations before Prof. Tuy stops.\n\nGiven a sequence $S$ consisting of $H$, $T$ and $?$, representing some initial state, where $?$ denotes an unknown state. Calculate the average value of $L(C)$ over all possible sequences $C$ represented by $S$.\n\nEven though Gon is smart, he is still unable to solve this question. Please help Gon!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single non-empty line with at most $10^6$ characters\u00a0\u2014 the sequence $S$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output must contain a single number\u00a0\u2014 the average value of $L(C)$, as explained in the statement.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn\u2019t exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\nNamely: let\u2019s assume that your answer is $a$, and the answer of the jury is $b$. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nHH\nSample Output 1:\n2.0\n\nSample Input 2:\nH?\nSample Output 2:\n1.5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
