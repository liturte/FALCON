He performs $n$ steps. On each step he takes a subset of integers already added to the array and appends the mex of this subset to the array. \n\nThe mex of an multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not presented in the multiset. For example, the mex of the multiset $[0, 2, 3]$ is $1$, while the mex of the multiset $[1, 2, 1]$ is $0$.\n\nMore formally, on the step $m$, when Ildar already has an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{m-1}$, he chooses some subset of indices $1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k < m$ (possibly, empty), where $0 \\leq k < m$, and appends the $mex(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots a_{i_k})$ to the end of the array.\n\nAfter performing all the steps Ildar thinks that he might have made a mistake somewhere. He asks you to determine for a given array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ the minimum step $t$ such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps $1, 2, \\ldots, t$, or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of steps Ildar made.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the array Ildar obtained.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Ildar could have chosen the subsets on each step in such a way that the resulting array is $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise print a single integer $t$\u00a0\u2014 the smallest index of a step such that a mistake was made on at least one step among steps $1, 2, \\ldots, t$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n0 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\nInput\n3\n1 0 1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n4\n0 1 2 239\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is possible that Ildar made no mistakes. Here is the process he could have followed.  $1$-st step. The initial array is empty. He can choose an empty subset and obtain $0$, because the mex of an empty set is $0$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0]$.  $2$-nd step. The current array is $[0]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1]$.  $3$-rd step. The current array is $[0,1]$. He can choose a subset $[0,1]$ and obtain an integer $2$, because $mex(0,1) = 2$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2]$.  $4$-th step. The current array is $[0,1,2]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2,1]$. \n\nThus, he can get the array without mistakes, so the answer is $-1$.\n\nIn the second example he has definitely made a mistake on the very first step, because he could not have obtained anything different from $0$.\n\nIn the third example he could have obtained $[0, 1, 2]$ without mistakes, but $239$ is definitely wrong.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
