Youyou can lift $"], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nIn competitive weightlifting, you must perform a sequence of lifts. You have a constant strength $s$, and a decreasing energy reserve $e$. For each lift, you may choose any positive (not necessarily integer) weight $w$ to attempt. If $s \\ge w$, the lift succeeds and your energy goes down by $e_{\\text {success}}$; if $s < w$, the lift fails and your energy goes down by $e_{\\text {failure}}$. You may continue attempting lifts as long as $e > 0$. If at any point $e \\le 0$, you can make no further attempts. Your score is the maximum weight you successfully lift or $0$ if every attempt failed.\n\nIdeally, you should lift exactly at your strength limit. However, you do not know your strength $s$. You only know that you can definitely lift the empty bar ($25\\text { kg}$), and that the maximum conceivable lift is $225\\text { kg}$. How close to an optimal score can you guarantee? That is, what\u2019s the smallest $d$ for which you can ensure a score of at least $s-d$?\n\nFor example, suppose $e = 4$, $e_{\\text {success}} = 1$ and $e_{\\text {failure}} = 2$. You try to lift $200\\text { kg}$ and fail. Now, $e = 2$. You try $100\\text { kg}$ and succeed. Now, $e = 1$. You try $150\\text { kg}$ and succeed. Now, $e = 0$ and you must stop. You know that you can lift $150\\text { kg}$, but you cannot lift $200\\text { kg}$. Your strength $s$ must be somewhere between $150\\text { kg}$ and $200\\text { kg}$. You scored $150$, your optimal score might be as high as (just under) $200$. You still don\u2019t know $s$, but you know you\u2019re within $50$. In this case, $d = 50$.\n\nThat\u2019s a specific example, and the strategy used is certainly not optimal. You can do better. What\u2019s the smallest value of $d$ you can get so that you can guarantee a score of at least $s-d$ for any and all possible values of $s$?\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input consists of a single line with $3$ space-separated integers $e$, $e_{\\text {success}}$, $e_{\\text {failure}}$ ($1 \\le e, e_{\\text {success}}, e_{\\text {failure}} \\le 10^7$) where $e$ is your beginning energy reserve, $e_{\\text {success}}$ is the amount of energy expended in a successful lift, and $e_{\\text {failure}}$ is the amount of energy expended in a failed lift.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with a real number $d$, which is the minimum weight in $\\text {kg}$ such that you can ensure a score of at least $s-d$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 3 3\nSample Output 1:\n112.5\n\nSample Input 2:\n12 3 3\nSample Output 2:\n13.333333333333334\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
