This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has $n$ positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from $0$ to $n - 1$ on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.\n\nThere are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position $x$, post lamp of power $l$ illuminates the segment $[x; x + l]$. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.\n\nThe post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power $1$ to power $k$. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power $l$ cost $a_l$ each.\n\nWhat is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $[0; n]$ of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power $3$ in position $n - 1$ (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment $[0; n]$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integer numbers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^6$, $0 \\le m \\le n$) \u2014 the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.\n\nThe second line contains $m$ integer numbers $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_m$ ($0 \\le s_1 < s_2 < \\dots s_m < n$) \u2014 the blocked positions.\n\nThe third line contains $k$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the costs of the post lamps.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $[0; n]$ of the street.\n\nIf illumintaing the entire segment $[0; n]$ is impossible, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 2 3\n1 3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n4 3 4\n1 2 3\n1 10 100 1000\n\nOutput\n1000\n\nInput\n5 1 5\n0\n3 3 3 3 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n7 4 3\n2 4 5 6\n3 14 15\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
