It is meant to denote the set of integers that lie between the values a and b. For example [3,5] denotes the set {3,4,5} while the interval [3, 3] denotes the set {3}.\n\nWe say that an interval [a, b] is covered by an integer i, if i belongs to the set defined by [a, b]. For example interval [3, 5] is covered by 3 and so is the interval [3, 3].\n\nGiven a set of intervals I, and a set of integers S we say that I is covered by S if for each interval [a, b] in I there is an integer i in S such that [a, b] is covered by i. For example, the set {[3, 5], [3, 3]} is covered by the set {3}. The set of intervals {[6, 9], [3, 5], [4, 8]} is covered by the set {4, 5, 8}. It is also covered by the set {4, 7}.\n\nWe would like to compute, for any set of intervals I, the size of the smallest set S that covers it. You can check that for the set of intervals {[6, 9], [3, 5], [4, 8]} the answer is 2 while for the set of intervals {[3, 5], [3, 3]} the answer is 1.\n\nYour program should take the set of intervals as input and output the size of the smallest set that covers it as the answer.\n\n-----Input format-----\nThe first line contains a single integer N, giving the number of intervals in the input.\n\nThis is followed by N lines, each containing two integers separated by a space describing an interval, with the first integer guaranteed to be less than or equal to the second integer.\n\n-----Output format-----\nOutput a single integer giving the size of the smallest set of integers that covers the given set of intervals.\n\n-----Test data-----\nYou may assume that all integers in the input are in the range 1 to 10^8 inclusive.\n\nSubtask 1 (100 marks) : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000.\n\n-----Sample Input 1-----\n2 \n3 5 \n3 3\n\n-----Sample Output 1-----\n1\n\n-----Sample Input 2-----\n3 \n6 9 \n3 5 \n4 8\n\n-----Sample Output 2-----\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
