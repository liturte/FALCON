VisuAlgo visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms in the Computer Science curriculum. Currently, it receives approximately 2000 hits/day from CS students and instructors worldwide.\n\nOne new feature of VisuAlgo is the online quiz. As an example, the above figure shows a question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination) Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this online quiz feature is that the question parameters are randomized. The drawn graph G is taken from a collection of hundreds of directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in VisuAlgo\u2019s internal database. The graph G has $V$ vertices numbered from $[0..V-1]$. The source vertex $s$ and the destination vertex $t$ are selected at random from $[0..V-1]$.\n\nHowever, such randomization of the question parameters may produce either a trivial question (e.g. \u201cNo Answer\u201d when $s$ and $t$ are disconnected, $0$ when $s = t$, simple tracing of a path if there is only a single unique path from $s$ to $t$ as shown in the above figure) or insanely difficult question to be computed manually if there are too many possible shortest paths from $s$ to $t$.\n\nThe developers of VisuAlgo want to calibrate such Shortest Paths question with randomized parameters so that it is possible for a normal Computer Science student to answer the randomly generated question manually within a reasonable amount of time. Please help them.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two non-negative integers $1 \\leq V \\leq 10000$ and $0 \\leq E \\leq 200000$, giving the number of vertices and edges of the drawn graph G.\n\nThereafter follow\u00a0$E$ lines, each describing the directed weighted edges in G by three integers $0 \\leq u, v \\leq V-1$ and $1 \\leq w \\leq 99$ (VisuAlgo limits the edge weight to be at most 2 characters for visual aesthetic purpose), where\u00a0$u$ and\u00a0$v$ are the vertex numbers and\u00a0$w$ is the weight of the directed edge $u \\rightarrow v$. It is guaranteed that G is a simple graph without self-loops or multiple directed edges with the same direction between the same pair of vertices.\n\nFinally, there are two integers in the last line of input $0 \\leq s, t \\leq V-1$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a line with the number of different shortest paths between $s$ to $t$ in G. Two shortest paths $p_1$ and $p_2$ are considered different if there exists at least one edge in $p_1$ that is not found in $p_2$. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer data type.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6 10\n0 1 26\n1 3 29\n1 5 9\n2 3 25\n2 4 43\n4 2 3\n5 0 13\n5 2 33\n5 3 18\n5 4 58\n5 1\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9\n0 1 1\n0 2 2\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 3\n3 4 1\n4 5 1\n4 6 2\n5 6 1\n0 6\nSample Output 2:\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
