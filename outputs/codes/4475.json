Initially, $a \\ge x$ and $b \\ge y$. You can do the following operation no more than $n$ times:\n\n  Choose either $a$ or $b$ and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of $a$ cannot become less than $x$, and value of $b$ cannot become less than $y$. \n\nYour task is to find the minimum possible product of $a$ and $b$ ($a \\cdot b$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $n$ times.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains five integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ and $n$ ($1 \\le a, b, x, y, n \\le 10^9$). Additional constraint on the input: $a \\ge x$ and $b \\ge y$ always holds.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of $a$ and $b$ ($a \\cdot b$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $n$ times.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n10 10 8 5 3\n12 8 8 7 2\n12343 43 4543 39 123212\n1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1\n1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000000\n10 11 2 1 5\n10 11 9 1 10\n\nOutput\n70\n77\n177177\n999999999000000000\n999999999\n55\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, you need to decrease $b$ three times and obtain $10 \\cdot 7 = 70$.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, you need to decrease $a$ one time, $b$ one time and obtain $11 \\cdot 7 = 77$.\n\nIn the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease $a$ five times and obtain $5 \\cdot 11 = 55$.\n\nIn the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease $b$ ten times and obtain $10 \\cdot 1 = 10$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
