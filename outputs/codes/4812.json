For example,\n - replacing the word \u201cstairs\u201d with the rhyming phrase \u201capples and pears\u201d,\n - or replacing \u201crotten\u201d with the phrase \u201cbales of cotton\u201d.\n\nEnglish has such a wide variety of spellings and pronunciations that for any non-native speaker telling what rhymes isn\u2019t always easy. Perhaps you can help?\n\nTypically, two words rhyme (or can be forced to rhyme) if both of their endings can be found on the same list of word endings that sound the same.\n\nGiven a common word, a number of lists, each containing word endings that sound the same, and a number of phrases, determine if those phrases could be rhyming slang.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing the single common word $S$ ($1 \\le |S| \\le 20$).\n - One line containing an integer $E$ ($1 \\le E \\le 10$), the number of lists of word endings that sound the same.\n - $E$ lines, each no more than $100$ characters long. Each a list of space-separated word endings.\n - One line containing an integer $P$ ($1 \\le P \\le 10$), the number of phrases to test.\n - $P$ lines, each no more than $100$ characters long, containing a phrase $p_ i$ of two or three words that might rhyme with the common word.\n\nAll words and letters will be in lower case. The common word\u2019s ending will appear in at least one ending list.\n\n-----Output-----\n - $P$ lines, each consisting of either:\n - \u2019YES\u2019: The phrase $p_ i$ rhymes with the common word.\n - \u2019NO\u2019: The phrase $p_ i$ does not rhyme with the common word.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nstairs\n2\nerres airs ears ares aires\neet eat\n2\napples and pears\nplates of meat\nSample Output 1:\nYES\nNO\n\nSample Input 2:\ndrought\n2\naught ought aut acht\nought oubt outte out oute\n5\ntasty sprout\ndifficult route\nworried and fraught\nforever in doubt\napples and pears\nSample Output 2:\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
