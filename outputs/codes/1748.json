Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift\u00a0\u2014 a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day i he will make a pile of snow of volume V_{i} and put it in her garden.\n\nEach day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is T_{i}, each pile will reduce its volume by T_{i}. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other. \n\nNote that the pile made on day i already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.\n\nYou are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of days. \n\nThe second line contains N integers V_1, V_2, ..., V_{N} (0 \u2264 V_{i} \u2264 10^9), where V_{i} is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day i.\n\nThe third line contains N integers T_1, T_2, ..., T_{N} (0 \u2264 T_{i} \u2264 10^9), where T_{i} is the temperature on the day i.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day i.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n10 10 5\n5 7 2\n\nOutput\n5 12 4\n\nInput\n5\n30 25 20 15 10\n9 10 12 4 13\n\nOutput\n9 20 35 11 25\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
