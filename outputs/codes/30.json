Also the $x$-mouse lives in the campus. The $x$-mouse is not just a mouse: each second $x$-mouse moves from room $i$ to the room $i \\cdot x \\mod{m}$ (in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the $x$-mouse is unknown.\n\nYou are responsible to catch the $x$-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the $x$-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.\n\nAnd the only observation you made is $\\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers $m$ and $x$ ($2 \\le m \\le 10^{14}$, $1 \\le x < m$, $\\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$) \u2014 the number of rooms and the parameter of $x$-mouse. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer \u2014 minimum number of traps you need to install to catch the $x$-mouse.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can, for example, put traps in rooms $0$, $2$, $3$. If the $x$-mouse starts in one of this rooms it will be caught immediately. If $x$-mouse starts in the $1$-st rooms then it will move to the room $3$, where it will be caught.\n\nIn the second example you can put one trap in room $0$ and one trap in any other room since $x$-mouse will visit all rooms $1..m-1$ if it will start in any of these rooms.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
