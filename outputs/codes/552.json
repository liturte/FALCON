The lengths of strings $a$ and $b$ are equal to $n$, the length of the string $s$ is equal to $m$. \n\nVasya decided to choose a substring of the string $a$, then choose a substring of the string $b$ and concatenate them. Formally, he chooses a segment $[l_1, r_1]$ ($1 \\leq l_1 \\leq r_1 \\leq n$) and a segment $[l_2, r_2]$ ($1 \\leq l_2 \\leq r_2 \\leq n$), and after concatenation he obtains a string $a[l_1, r_1] + b[l_2, r_2] = a_{l_1} a_{l_1 + 1} \\ldots a_{r_1} b_{l_2} b_{l_2 + 1} \\ldots b_{r_2}$.\n\nNow, Vasya is interested in counting number of ways to choose those segments adhering to the following conditions:\n\n  segments $[l_1, r_1]$ and $[l_2, r_2]$ have non-empty intersection, i.e. there exists at least one integer $x$, such that $l_1 \\leq x \\leq r_1$ and $l_2 \\leq x \\leq r_2$;  the string $a[l_1, r_1] + b[l_2, r_2]$ is equal to the string $s$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 500\\,000, 2 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot n$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of strings $a$ and $b$ and the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe next three lines contain strings $a$, $b$ and $s$, respectively.
