Therefore, during the next team training A decided to make teams so that newbies are solving problems together with experienced participants.\n\nA believes that the optimal team of three people should consist of one experienced participant and two newbies. Thus, each experienced participant can share the experience with a large number of people.\n\nHowever, B believes that the optimal team should have two experienced members plus one newbie. Thus, each newbie can gain more knowledge and experience.\n\nAs a result, A and B have decided that all the teams during the training session should belong to one of the two types described above. Furthermore, they agree that the total number of teams should be as much as possible.\n\nThere are n experienced members and m newbies on the training session. Can you calculate what maximum number of teams can be formed?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of experienced participants and newbies that are present at the training session. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number of teams that can be formed.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's represent the experienced players as XP and newbies as NB.\n\nIn the first test the teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB).\n\nIn the second test sample the teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB), (XP, XP, NB).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
