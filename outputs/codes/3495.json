However, since he knows little about robotics and mathematics, he decided to build a $2$-dimensional robotic arm to bootstrap his knowledge.\n\nThe robotic arm is composed of $N$ segments of various lengths. The segments can form any angle between them, including configurations that make it appear to self-intersect when viewed from above. The robotic arm works great, but it is not trivial to position the arm\u2019s tip as close as possible to given $x$, $y$ target coordinates with so many joints to control. Can you help Jo\u00e3o?\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven the robotic arm description and target coordinates relative to the arm\u2019s origin, calculate a configuration that places the arm\u2019s tip as close as possible to the target.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains $N$, the number of segments composing the robotic arm. $N$ lines follow, each with an integer $L_ i$ describing the length of the $i$th segment from the fixed point until the arm\u2019s tip. There is one more line with $2$ integers: the $x$, $y$ coordinates of the target point to reach.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\n$1$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$N$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$20$\n\nNumber of segments in the robotic arm\n\n$1$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$L_ i$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$1000$\n\nLength of the $i$th segment\n\n$-20000$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$x, y$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$20000$\n\nTarget coordinates to attempt to reach\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should contain $N$ lines, each containing two real numbers $x_ i$, $y_ i$ indicating the coordinates of the tip of the $i$th segment.\n\nThe length of the $i$th segment computed from the solution and input $L_ i$ may not differ by more than $0.01$. Similarly, the absolute error between the solution\u2019s distance to the target and the minimum possible distance to the target cannot exceed $0.01$.\n\nNote that, in general, there are many solutions. Your program may output any of them.\n\n-----Explanation for Sample Input 1-----\nSample output 1 corresponds to the drawing on the left:\n\n\n\nThe drawing on the right corresponds to the following, equally acceptable output for sample input 1:\n\n3.923 3.100\n1.118 2.037\n5.000 3.000\n\n\n-----Explanation for Sample Input 2-----\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n5\n3\n4\n5 3\nSample Output:\n4.114 -2.842\n6.297 -0.784\n5.000 3.000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
