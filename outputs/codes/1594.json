He has n songs in his play list. We know that song number i has the duration of t_{i} minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number i c_{i} times. Eugeny's play list is organized as follows: first song number 1 plays c_1 times, then song number 2 plays c_2 times, ..., in the end the song number n plays c_{n} times.\n\nEugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out m moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment x means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the x-th minute of his listening to the play list.\n\nHelp Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5). The next n lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers c_{i}, t_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i}, t_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the description of the play list. It is guaranteed that the play list's total duration doesn't exceed 10^9 $(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{i} \\cdot t_{i} \\leq 10^{9})$.\n\nThe next line contains m positive integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{m}, that describe the moments Eugeny has written out. It is guaranteed that there isn't such moment of time v_{i}, when the music doesn't play any longer. It is guaranteed that v_{i} < v_{i} + 1 (i < m).\n\nThe moment of time v_{i} means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the v_{i}-th munite from the start of listening to the playlist.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint m integers \u2014 the i-th number must equal the number of the song that was playing during the v_{i}-th minute after Eugeny started listening to the play list.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2\n2 8\n1 16\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n\nInput\n4 9\n1 2\n2 1\n1 1\n2 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
