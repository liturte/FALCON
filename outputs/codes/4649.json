Your task is to change the minimum number of characters in the initial string $s$ so that after the changes there will be a string of length $k$ that is a substring of $s$, and is also a substring of the infinite string \"RGBRGBRGB ...\".\n\nA string $a$ is a substring of string $b$ if there exists a positive integer $i$ such that $a_1 = b_i$, $a_2 = b_{i + 1}$, $a_3 = b_{i + 2}$, ..., $a_{|a|} = b_{i + |a| - 1}$.
