It is the final round. He has only one opponent\u00a0\u2014 Elodreip. The are $n$ students in the school. Each student has exactly $k$ votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives $a_i$ votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly $k - a_i$ votes from this person. Of course $0 \\le k - a_i$ holds.\n\nAwruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ \u2014 how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number $k$ to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger $k$ means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.\n\nSo, Awruk knows $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ \u2014 how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number $k$. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of students in the school.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the smallest integer $k$ ($k \\ge \\max a_i$) which gives Awruk the victory. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 1 1 5 1\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n5\n2 2 3 2 2\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Elodreip gets $1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9$ votes. The smallest possible $k$ is $5$ (it surely can't be less due to the fourth person), and it leads to $4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 16$ votes for Awruk, which is enough to win.\n\nIn the second example, Elodreip gets $11$ votes. If $k = 4$, Awruk gets $9$ votes and loses to Elodreip.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
