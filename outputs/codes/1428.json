Let (i,j) be the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.\nThese squares have to be painted in one of the C colors from Color 1 to Color C. Initially, (i,j) is painted in Color c_{i,j}.\nWe say the grid is a good grid when the following condition is met for all i,j,x,y satisfying 1 \\leq i,j,x,y \\leq N:\n - If (i+j) \\% 3=(x+y) \\% 3, the color of (i,j) and the color of (x,y) are the same.\n - If (i+j) \\%  3 \\neq (x+y) \\% 3, the color of (i,j) and the color of (x,y) are different.\nHere, X \\% Y represents X modulo Y.\nWe will repaint zero or more squares so that the grid will be a good grid.\nFor a square, the wrongness when the color of the square is X before repainting and Y after repainting, is D_{X,Y}.\nFind the minimum possible sum of the wrongness of all the squares.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 500\n - 3 \\leq C \\leq 30\n - 1 \\leq D_{i,j} \\leq 1000 (i \\neq j),D_{i,j}=0 (i=j)\n - 1 \\leq c_{i,j} \\leq C\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN C\nD_{1,1} ...

The wrongness of (1,1) becomes D_{1,2}=1.\n - Repaint (1,2) to Color 3. The wrongness of (1,2) becomes D_{2,3}=1.\n - Repaint (2,2) to Color 1.
