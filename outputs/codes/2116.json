Recently his department has started a ''click and collect\" service which allows users to shop online. \n\nThe store contains k items. n customers have already used the above service. Each user paid for m items. Let a_{ij} denote the j-th item in the i-th person's order.\n\nDue to the space limitations all the items are arranged in one single row. When Ayush receives the i-th order he will find one by one all the items a_{ij} (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) in the row. Let pos(x) denote the position of the item x in the row at the moment of its collection. Then Ayush takes time equal to pos(a_{i}1) + pos(a_{i}2) + ... + pos(a_{im}) for the i-th customer.\n\nWhen Ayush accesses the x-th element he keeps a new stock in the front of the row and takes away the x-th element. Thus the values are updating.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total time it takes for Ayush to process all the orders.\n\nYou can assume that the market has endless stock.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k) \u2014 the number of users, the number of items each user wants to buy and the total number of items at the market.\n\nThe next line contains k distinct integers p_{l} (1 \u2264 p_{l} \u2264 k) denoting the initial positions of the items in the store. The items are numbered with integers from 1 to k.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains m distinct integers a_{ij} (1 \u2264 a_{ij} \u2264 k) \u2014 the order of the i-th person.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer t \u2014 the total time needed for Ayush to process all the orders.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2 2 5\n3 4 1 2 5\n1 5\n3 1\n\nOutput\n14\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nCustomer 1 wants the items 1 and 5.\n\npos(1) = 3, so the new positions are: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5].\n\npos(5) = 5, so the new positions are: [5, 1, 3, 4, 2].\n\nTime taken for the first customer is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nCustomer 2 wants the items 3 and 1.\n\npos(3) = 3, so the new positions are: [3, 5, 1, 4, 2].\n\npos(1) = 3, so the new positions are: [1, 3, 5, 4, 2].\n\nTime taken for the second customer is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nTotal time is 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nFormally pos(x) is the index of x in the current row.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
