She has only s burles for that. She can buy each gadget for dollars or for pounds. So each gadget is selling only for some type of currency. The type of currency and the cost in that currency are not changing.\n\nNura can buy gadgets for n days. For each day you know the exchange rates of dollar and pound, so you know the cost of conversion burles to dollars or to pounds.\n\nEach day (from 1 to n) Nura can buy some gadgets by current exchange rate. Each day she can buy any gadgets she wants, but each gadget can be bought no more than once during n days.\n\nHelp Nura to find the minimum day index when she will have k gadgets. Nura always pays with burles, which are converted according to the exchange rate of the purchase day. Nura can't buy dollars or pounds, she always stores only burles. Gadgets are numbered with integers from 1 to m in order of their appearing in input.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains four integers n, m, k, s (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 10^9) \u2014 number of days, total number and required number of gadgets, number of burles Nura has.\n\nSecond line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the cost of one dollar in burles on i-th day.\n\nThird line contains n integers b_{i} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the cost of one pound in burles on i-th day.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers t_{i}, c_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 type of the gadget and it's cost. For the gadgets of the first type cost is specified in dollars. For the gadgets of the second type cost is specified in pounds.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Nura can't buy k gadgets print the only line with the number -1.\n\nOtherwise the first line should contain integer d \u2014 the minimum day index, when Nura will have k gadgets. On each of the next k lines print two integers q_{i}, d_{i} \u2014 the number of gadget and the day gadget should be bought. All values q_{i} should be different, but the values d_{i} can coincide (so Nura can buy several gadgets at one day). The days are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nIn case there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 4 2 2\n1 2 3 2 1\n3 2 1 2 3\n1 1\n2 1\n1 2\n2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n1 1\n2 3\n\nInput\n4 3 2 200\n69 70 71 72\n104 105 106 107\n1 1\n2 2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n4 3 1 1000000000\n900000 910000 940000 990000\n990000 999000 999900 999990\n1 87654\n2 76543\n1 65432\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
