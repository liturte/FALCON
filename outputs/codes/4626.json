Initially, the first friend stays at the position $x = a$, the second friend stays at the position $x = b$ and the third friend stays at the position $x = c$ on the coordinate axis $Ox$.\n\nIn one minute each friend independently from other friends can change the position $x$ by $1$ to the left or by $1$ to the right (i.e. set $x := x - 1$ or $x := x + 1$) or even don't change it.\n\nLet's introduce the total pairwise distance \u2014 the sum of distances between each pair of friends. Let $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$ be the final positions of the first, the second and the third friend, correspondingly. Then the total pairwise distance is $|a' - b'| + |a' - c'| + |b' - c'|$, where $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$.\n\nFriends are interested in the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach if they will move optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, they want to know the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe test cases. The $i$-th test case is given as three integers $a, b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^9$) \u2014 initial positions of the first, second and third friend correspondingly. The positions of friends can be equal.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print the answer on it \u2014 the minimum total pairwise distance (the minimum sum of distances between each pair of friends) if friends change their positions optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, you have to find the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n8\n3 3 4\n10 20 30\n5 5 5\n2 4 3\n1 1000000000 1000000000\n1 1000000000 999999999\n3 2 5\n3 2 6\n\nOutput\n0\n36\n0\n0\n1999999994\n1999999994\n2\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
