Usually \"zzz\" comes out of people's mouth while sleeping, but string s of length n comes out from Tavas' mouth instead. [Image] \n\nToday Tavas fell asleep in Malekas' place. While he was sleeping, Malekas did a little process on s. Malekas has a favorite string p. He determined all positions x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{k} where p matches s. More formally, for each x_{i} (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) he condition s_{x}_{i}s_{x}_{i} + 1... s_{x}_{i} + |p| - 1 = p is fullfilled.\n\nThen Malekas wrote down one of subsequences of x_1, x_2, ... x_{k} (possibly, he didn't write anything) on a piece of paper. Here a sequence b is a subsequence of sequence a if and only if we can turn a into b by removing some of its elements (maybe no one of them or all).\n\nAfter Tavas woke up, Malekas told him everything. He couldn't remember string s, but he knew that both p and s only contains lowercase English letters and also he had the subsequence he had written on that piece of paper.\n\nTavas wonders, what is the number of possible values of s? He asked SaDDas, but he wasn't smart enough to solve this. So, Tavas asked you to calculate this number for him.\n\nAnswer can be very large, so Tavas wants you to print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m, the length of s and the length of the subsequence Malekas wrote down (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6 and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n - |p| + 1).\n\nThe second line contains string p (1 \u2264 |p| \u2264 n).\n\nThe next line contains m space separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m}, Malekas' subsequence (1 \u2264 y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_{m} \u2264 n - |p| + 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the answer modulo 1000 000 007.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 2\nioi\n1 3\n\nOutput\n26\n\nInput\n5 2\nioi\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all strings of form \"ioioi?\" where the question mark replaces arbitrary English letter satisfy.\n\nHere |x| denotes the length of string x.\n\nPlease note that it's possible that there is no such string (answer is 0).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
