She knows that it will take t seconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.\n\nBut she has some work to do in each of n next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during i-th day is a_{i}. If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.\n\nHelp Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed n.\n\nRemember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of days and the time required to read the book.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 86400) \u2014 the time Luba has to spend on her work during i-th day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.\n\nIt is guaranteed that answer doesn't exceed n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\n86400 86398\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2 86400\n0 86400\n\nOutput\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
