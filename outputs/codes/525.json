To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!\n\nA password is an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index $i$ such that $1 \\leq i < n$ and $a_{i} \\neq a_{i+1}$, delete both $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ from the array and put $a_{i}+a_{i+1}$ in their place. \n\nFor example, for array $[7, 4, 3, 7]$ you can choose $i = 2$ and the array will become $[7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]$. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.\n\nNotice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by $1$. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly $0$) of operations?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the password.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{n}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial contents of your password.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n4\n2 1 3 1\n2\n420 420\n\nOutput\n1\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of $1$:\n\nPick $i=2$ to get $[2, 4, 1]$\n\nPick $i=1$ to get $[6, 1]$\n\nPick $i=1$ to get $[7]$\n\nIn the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid $i$ that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
