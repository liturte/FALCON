Once he wanted to expand his collection with exactly one antique item.\n\nValera knows n sellers of antiques, the i-th of them auctioned k_{i} items. Currently the auction price of the j-th object of the i-th seller is s_{ij}. Valera gets on well with each of the n sellers. He is perfectly sure that if he outbids the current price of one of the items in the auction (in other words, offers the seller the money that is strictly greater than the current price of the item at the auction), the seller of the object will immediately sign a contract with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Valera has only v units of money. Help him to determine which of the n sellers he can make a deal with.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, v (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50;\u00a010^4 \u2264 v \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of sellers and the units of money the Valera has.\n\nThen n lines follow. The i-th line first contains integer k_{i} (1 \u2264 k_{i} \u2264 50) the number of items of the i-th seller. Then go k_{i} space-separated integers s_{i}1, s_{i}2, ..., s_{ik}_{i} (10^4 \u2264 s_{ij} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the current prices of the items of the i-th seller. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print integer p \u2014 the number of sellers with who Valera can make a deal.\n\nIn the second line print p space-separated integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{p} (1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the numbers of the sellers with who Valera can make a deal. Print the numbers of the sellers in the increasing order. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 50000\n1 40000\n2 20000 60000\n3 10000 70000 190000\n\nOutput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nInput\n3 50000\n1 50000\n3 100000 120000 110000\n3 120000 110000 120000\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Valera can bargain with each of the sellers. He can outbid the following items: a 40000 item from the first seller, a 20000 item from the second seller, and a 10000 item from the third seller.\n\nIn the second sample Valera can not make a deal with any of the sellers, as the prices of all items in the auction too big for him.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
