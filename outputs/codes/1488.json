He wants to become a tourist himself, so he planned a trip. There are n destinations on a straight road that Iahub wants to visit. Iahub starts the excursion from kilometer 0. The n destinations are described by a non-negative integers sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The number a_{k} represents that the kth destination is at distance a_{k} kilometers from the starting point. No two destinations are located in the same place. \n\nIahub wants to visit each destination only once. Note that, crossing through a destination is not considered visiting, unless Iahub explicitly wants to visit it at that point. Also, after Iahub visits his last destination, he doesn't come back to kilometer 0, as he stops his trip at the last destination. \n\nThe distance between destination located at kilometer x and next destination, located at kilometer y, is |x - y| kilometers. We call a \"route\" an order of visiting the destinations. Iahub can visit destinations in any order he wants, as long as he visits all n destinations and he doesn't visit a destination more than once. \n\nIahub starts writing out on a paper all possible routes and for each of them, he notes the total distance he would walk. He's interested in the average number of kilometers he would walk by choosing a route. As he got bored of writing out all the routes, he asks you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). Next line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^7).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput two integers \u2014 the numerator and denominator of a fraction which is equal to the wanted average number. The fraction must be irreducible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 5\n\nOutput\n22 3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider 6 possible routes:  [2, 3, 5]: total distance traveled: |2 \u2013 0| + |3 \u2013 2| + |5 \u2013 3| = 5;  [2, 5, 3]: |2 \u2013 0| + |5 \u2013 2| + |3 \u2013 5| = 7;  [3, 2, 5]: |3 \u2013 0| + |2 \u2013 3| + |5 \u2013 2| = 7;  [3, 5, 2]: |3 \u2013 0| + |5 \u2013 3| + |2 \u2013 5| = 8;  [5, 2, 3]: |5 \u2013 0| + |2 \u2013 5| + |3 \u2013 2| = 9;  [5, 3, 2]: |5 \u2013 0| + |3 \u2013 5| + |2 \u2013 3| = 8. \n\nThe average travel distance is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot(5 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 8)$ = $\\frac{44}{6}$ = $\\frac{22}{3}$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
