One can prove that if at least one answer exists, there exists an answer of length no more than 1 000 000.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains four non-negative integers a_00, a_01, a_10 and a_11. Each of them doesn't exceed 10^9.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a non-empty string that matches four integers from the input, print it in the only line of the output. Otherwise, print \"Impossible\". The length of your answer must not exceed 1 000 000.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\nImpossible\n\nInput\n1 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n0110\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
