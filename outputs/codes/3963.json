Conveniently, the denomination of the coin type k divides the denomination of the coin type k + 1, the denomination of the coin type 1 equals 1 tugrick. The ratio of the denominations of coin types k + 1 and k equals a_{k}. It is known that for each x there are at most 20 coin types of denomination x.\n\nByteasar has b_{k} coins of type k with him, and he needs to pay exactly m tugricks. It is known that Byteasar never has more than 3\u00b710^5 coins with him. Byteasar want to know how many ways there are to pay exactly m tugricks. Two ways are different if there is an integer k such that the amount of coins of type k differs in these two ways. As all Byteland citizens, Byteasar wants to know the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of coin types.\n\nThe second line contains n - 1 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 \u2264 a_{k} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the ratios between the coin types denominations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of these integers doesn't exceed 3\u00b710^5.\n\nThe fourth line contains single integer m (0 \u2264 m < 10^10000)\u00a0\u2014 the amount in tugricks Byteasar needs to pay.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of ways to pay exactly m tugricks modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\n4\n2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2\n1\n4 4\n2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n3 3\n10 10 10\n17\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Byteasar has 4 coins of denomination 1, and he has to pay 2 tugricks.

There are 3 ways: pay one coin of the first type and one coin of the other, pay two coins of the first type, and pay two coins of the second type.\n\nIn the third example the denominations are equal to 1, 3, 9.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
