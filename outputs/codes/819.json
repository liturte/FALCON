You have to split the array into exactly k non-empty subsegments. You'll then compute the minimum integer on each subsegment, and take the maximum integer over the k obtained minimums. What is the maximum possible integer you can get?\n\nDefinitions of subsegment and array splitting are given in notes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264  10^5) \u2014 the size of the array a and the number of subsegments you have to split the array to.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_{n} ( - 10^9  \u2264  a_{i} \u2264  10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer \u2014 the maximum possible integer you can get if you split the array into k non-empty subsegments and take maximum of minimums on the subsegments.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n5 1\n-4 -5 -3 -2 -1\n\nOutput\n-5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nA subsegment [l,  r] (l \u2264 r) of array a is the sequence a_{l},  a_{l} + 1,  ...,  a_{r}.\n\nSplitting of array a of n elements into k subsegments [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_{k}, r_{k}] (l_1 = 1, r_{k} = n, l_{i} = r_{i} - 1 + 1 for all i > 1) is k sequences (a_{l}_1, ..., a_{r}_1), ..., (a_{l}_{k}, ..., a_{r}_{k}).\n\nIn the first example you should split the array into subsegments [1, 4] and [5, 5] that results in sequences (1, 2, 3, 4) and (5). The minimums are min(1, 2, 3, 4) = 1 and min(5) = 5. The resulting maximum is max(1, 5) = 5. It is obvious that you can't reach greater result.\n\nIn the second example the only option you have is to split the array into one subsegment [1, 5], that results in one sequence ( - 4,  - 5,  - 3,  - 2,  - 1). The only minimum is min( - 4,  - 5,  - 3,  - 2,  - 1) =  - 5. The resulting maximum is  - 5.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
