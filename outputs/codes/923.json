He is now investigating a case of frauds who make fake copies of the famous Stolp's gears, puzzles that are as famous as the Rubik's cube once was.\n\nIts most important components are a button and a line of n similar gears. Each gear has n teeth containing all numbers from 0 to n - 1 in the counter-clockwise order. When you push a button, the first gear rotates clockwise, then the second gear rotates counter-clockwise, the the third gear rotates clockwise an so on.\n\nBesides, each gear has exactly one active tooth. When a gear turns, a new active tooth is the one following after the current active tooth according to the direction of the rotation. For example, if n = 5, and the active tooth is the one containing number 0, then clockwise rotation makes the tooth with number 1 active, or the counter-clockwise rotating makes the tooth number 4 active.\n\nAndrewid remembers that the real puzzle has the following property: you can push the button multiple times in such a way that in the end the numbers on the active teeth of the gears from first to last form sequence 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1. Write a program that determines whether the given puzzle is real or fake.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of gears.\n\nThe second line contains n digits a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n - 1) \u2014 the sequence of active teeth: the active tooth of the i-th gear contains number a_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the given Stolp's gears puzzle is real, and \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 0 0\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n5\n4 2 1 4 3\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n4\n0 2 3 1\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test when you push the button for the first time, the sequence of active teeth will be 2 2 1, when you push it for the second time, you get 0 1 2.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
