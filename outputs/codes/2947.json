She believes the whole world revolves around them, and that everything is connected by numbers. Her friends, Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diane, are not convinced. But she gives them an example:  Alice lives in house number 25 on her street, but that is exactly Bob\u2019s age. Bob is born on June 4th, and Charlie was his parents\u2019 fourth child. Finally, Diane has five fingers on her left hand, which happens to be the same as the number of toes that Bob has on his right foot! \n\nThis shows that her friends are all connected\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014by numbers. But she still has to convince her family as well as her coworkers.\n\nGiven a group of $n$ individuals, and a set of numbers that describe each individual, help Lily come up with a proof that shows that everyone in this group is either directly or indirectly connected by numbers, or determine that this is not possible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line with an integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$), the number of individuals in the group. The individuals are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n - $n$ lines, describing the individuals in the group.\n\nThe $i$th such line starts with an integer $m_ i$ ($1 \\leq m_ i \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$), the number of numbers that describe individual $i$.\n\nThe remainder of the line has $m_ i$ distinct integers $d_{i,1},\\ldots ,d_{i,m_ i}$ ($1 \\leq d_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$ for each $j$), the set of numbers that describe individual $i$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum over all $m_ i$ is at most $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a proof in the form of $n-1$ lines, each of which contains three integers $p$, $q$ and $r$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct individuals that are both described by the number $r$. Using only these relations, it must be possible to show that any pair of individuals in the group are connected either directly or indirectly.\n\nIf no such proof exists, output \u201cimpossible\u201d. If there are multiple proofs, you may output any one of them.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6\n2 17 10\n1 5\n2 10 22\n3 17 22 9\n2 17 8\n3 9 22 16\nSample Output:\nimpossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
