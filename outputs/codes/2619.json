There you can see n stars, the i-th has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}), a maximum brightness c, equal for all stars, and an initial brightness s_{i} (0 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 c).\n\nOver time the stars twinkle. At moment 0 the i-th star has brightness s_{i}. Let at moment t some star has brightness x. Then at moment (t + 1) this star will have brightness x + 1, if x + 1 \u2264 c, and 0, otherwise.\n\nYou want to look at the sky q times. In the i-th time you will look at the moment t_{i} and you will see a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left corner has coordinates (x_1i, y_1i) and the upper right\u00a0\u2014 (x_2i, y_2i). For each view, you want to know the total brightness of the stars lying in the viewed rectangle.\n\nA star lies in a rectangle if it lies on its border or lies strictly inside it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, q, c (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the stars, the number of the views and the maximum brightness of the stars.\n\nThe next n lines contain the stars description. The i-th from these lines contains three integers x_{i}, y_{i}, s_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 c \u2264 10)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of i-th star and its initial brightness.\n\nThe next q lines contain the views description. The i-th from these lines contains five integers t_{i}, x_1i, y_1i, x_2i, y_2i (0 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x_1i < x_2i \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 y_1i < y_2i \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the moment of the i-th view and the coordinates of the viewed rectangle.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each view print the total brightness of the viewed stars.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3 3\n1 1 1\n3 2 0\n2 1 1 2 2\n0 2 1 4 5\n5 1 1 5 5\n\nOutput\n3\n0\n3\n\nInput\n3 4 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 0\n3 3 1\n0 1 1 100 100\n1 2 2 4 4\n2 2 1 4 7\n1 50 50 51 51\n\nOutput\n3\n3\n5\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example.\n\nAt the first view, you can see only the first star. At moment 2 its brightness is 3, so the answer is 3.\n\nAt the second view, you can see only the second star. At moment 0 its brightness is 0, so the answer is 0.\n\nAt the third view, you can see both stars. At moment 5 brightness of the first is 2, and brightness of the second is 1, so the answer is 3.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
