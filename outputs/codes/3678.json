They are smart and lovely kids, and they are both very good at math and programming. One day, chubby Trung set a puzzle to challenge skinny Hanh. Trung gives a list of $n$ distinct points on a Cartesian coordinate plane to Hanh and asks Hanh to draw a single loop connecting all these points with some conditions:\n - The loop consists of exactly $n$ segments that are parallel to the axes.\n - Each segment\u2019s two ends must be $2$ of the given points. Other than these $2$ points, the segment must not go through any other points from the list.\n - Two consecutive segments in the loop must be perpendicular (i.e. they must form a $90$ degree angle), and they must have exactly one intersection (which is at their common end).\n - The loop must go through all $n$ points. The first and last point of the loop must be the same.\n - The loop must not self-intersect.\n\nIn the following examples, the first figure shows a valid loop. The second figure shows an invalid loop because there are segments\u2019 ends at $(2,2)$ which is not in the list. The third one is also invalid because it does not go through all $n$ points. And the last figure is also invalid because there exists $2$ consecutive segments that are not perpendicular.\n\nYour task is to help skinny Hanh determine whether it is possible to create such loop.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with an positive integer $t$ \u2013 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow, each has the following format:\n - The first line consists of an integer $n$ \u2013 the number of points in the list ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$). The sum of $n$ in all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n - The $i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains $2$ integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$ describing the $i$-th point ($0 \\leq \\lvert x_ i \\rvert ,\\lvert y_ i \\rvert \\leq 10^9$). It is guaranteed that no two points have the same coordinates.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, if it is possible to draw the loop, print \u2018YES\u2019; otherwise, print \u2018NO\u2019.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n6\n1 1\n1 3\n2 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 2\n3\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\nSample Output:\nYES\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
