By pressing this button, you watch the current minute of the movie and the player automatically proceeds to the next minute of the movie.  Skip exactly x minutes of the movie (x is some fixed positive integer). If the player is now at the t-th minute of the movie, then as a result of pressing this button, it proceeds to the minute (t + x). \n\nInitially the movie is turned on in the player on the first minute, and you want to watch exactly n best moments of the movie, the i-th best moment starts at the l_{i}-th minute and ends at the r_{i}-th minute (more formally, the i-th best moment consists of minutes: l_{i}, l_{i} + 1, ..., r_{i}). \n\nDetermine, what is the minimum number of minutes of the movie you have to watch if you want to watch all the best moments?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of the best moments of the movie and the value of x for the second button.\n\nThe following n lines contain the descriptions of the best moments of the movie, the i-th line of the description contains two integers separated by a space l_{i}, r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 10^5).\n\nIt is guaranteed that for all integers i from 2 to n the following condition holds: r_{i} - 1 < l_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n5 6\n10 12\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n1 1\n1 100000\n\nOutput\n100000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the player was initially standing on the first minute. As the minutes from the 1-st to the 4-th one don't contain interesting moments, we press the second button. Now we can not press the second button and skip 3 more minutes, because some of them contain interesting moments. Therefore, we watch the movie from the 4-th to the 6-th minute, after that the current time is 7. Similarly, we again skip 3 minutes and then watch from the 10-th to the 12-th minute of the movie. In total, we watch 6 minutes of the movie.\n\nIn the second sample, the movie is very interesting, so you'll have to watch all 100000 minutes of the movie.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
