Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf b appears in the sequence s print \"YES\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 7 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n10 10 0\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n1 -4 5\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n0 60 50\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.\n\nIn the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.\n\nIn the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
