They brought a really huge candy matrix, it's big even for Sereja! Let's number the rows of the giant matrix from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m, from left to right. We'll represent the cell on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column as (i, j). Just as is expected, some cells of the giant candy matrix contain candies. Overall the matrix has p candies: the k-th candy is at cell (x_{k}, y_{k}).\n\nThe time moved closer to dinner and Inna was already going to eat p of her favourite sweets from the matrix, when suddenly Sereja (for the reason he didn't share with anyone) rotated the matrix x times clockwise by 90 degrees. Then he performed the horizontal rotate of the matrix y times. And then he rotated the matrix z times counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The figure below shows how the rotates of the matrix looks like. [Image] \n\nInna got really upset, but Duma suddenly understood two things: the candies didn't get damaged and he remembered which cells contained Inna's favourite sweets before Sereja's strange actions. Help guys to find the new coordinates in the candy matrix after the transformation Sereja made!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains fix integers n, m, x, y, z, p (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^9;\u00a00 \u2264 x, y, z \u2264 10^9;\u00a01 \u2264 p \u2264 10^5).\n\nEach of the following p lines contains two integers x_{k}, y_{k} (1 \u2264 x_{k} \u2264 n;\u00a01 \u2264 y_{k} \u2264 m) \u2014 the initial coordinates of the k-th candy. Two candies can lie on the same cell.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each of the p candies, print on a single line its space-separated new coordinates.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 3 1 1 9\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n\nOutput\n1 3\n1 2\n1 1\n2 3\n2 2\n2 1\n3 3\n3 2\n3 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nJust for clarity. Horizontal rotating is like a mirroring of the matrix. For matrix:\n\nQWER      REWQ \n\nASDF  ->  FDSA\n\nZXCV      VCXZ\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
