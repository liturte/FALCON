(Can you speak pig latin?) If you can\u2019t, here are the rules:\n - If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of the word, then add ay to the end of the word. Examples: pig $\\to $ igpay, there$\\to $ erethay.\n - If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), simply add yay to the end of the word. For this problem, y is always a vowel.
