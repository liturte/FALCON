One day you notice that someone has touched your collection, and that some of the cards are now out of order. The most natural suspect, of course, is your little brother Billy, who was absolutely $100\\% $ forbidden from playing with your cards. After a few minutes of interrogation Billy confesses that he indeed took a few consecutive cards from the middle of the stack, but he swears that he put them back in exactly the same order as they were. You suspect that Billy, being so young, may have simply mistakenly reversed the order of the cards that he took. Now you want to check your theory and decide if you can find the batch of cards that Billy took to play with. \n\nIs it possible to restore the order of the cards into non-decreasing order of their rarity by reversing just one contiguous batch of cards?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - One line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$), the number of cards in your collection.\n - One line containing $n$ integers $v_1, \\ldots , v_ n$ ($1 \\le v_{i} \\le 10^9$ for all $i$), the current order of the cards\u2019 rarity values.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the cards can be sorted by reversing exactly one contiguous subsequence of the list, then output the $1$-based start and end indices of such a subsequence. Otherwise, output \u201cimpossible\u201d. If there are multiple valid solutions you may output any one of them.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n7\n10 13 19 19 15 14 20\nSample Output 1:\n3 6\n\nSample Input 2:\n6\n9 1 8 2 7 3\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
