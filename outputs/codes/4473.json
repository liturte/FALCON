It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is $a$ units to the right, the second jump is $b$ units to the left, the third jump is $a$ units to the right, the fourth jump is $b$ units to the left, and so on.\n\nFormally:   if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position $x$ to position $x+a$;  otherwise it jumps from its current position $x$ to position $x-b$. \n\nYour task is to calculate the position of the frog after $k$ jumps.\n\nBut... One more thing. You are watching $t$ different frogs so you have to answer $t$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $t$ lines contain queries (one query per line).\n\nThe query is described as three space-separated integers $a, b, k$ ($1 \\le a, b, k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the lengths of two types of jumps and the number of jumps, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ integers. The $i$-th integer should be the answer for the $i$-th query.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n5 2 3\n100 1 4\n1 10 5\n1000000000 1 6\n1 1 1000000000\n1 1 999999999\n\nOutput\n8\n198\n-17\n2999999997\n0\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query frog jumps $5$ to the right, $2$ to the left and $5$ to the right so the answer is $5 - 2 + 5 = 8$.\n\nIn the second query frog jumps $100$ to the right, $1$ to the left, $100$ to the right and $1$ to the left so the answer is $100 - 1 + 100 - 1 = 198$.\n\nIn the third query the answer is $1 - 10 + 1 - 10 + 1 = -17$.\n\nIn the fourth query the answer is $10^9 - 1 + 10^9 - 1 + 10^9 - 1 = 2999999997$.\n\nIn the fifth query all frog's jumps are neutralized by each other so the answer is $0$.\n\nThe sixth query is the same as the fifth but without the last jump so the answer is $1$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
