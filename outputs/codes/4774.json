In order to continue their work, they need to get some materials from the closest asteroid. To do that though, they need to start up the chemical engines, which haven\u2019t been started for multiple centuries.\n\nGloisa has been reading the manual for the last three weeks, and is almost able to start it up. However, there is one equation she needs that has some operators smudged out. That equation is\\[ a~ ?~ b~ =~ c~ ?~ d \\]\n\nwhere the question marks are the unknown operators. So far, Gloisa has only managed to narrow the operators down to $+$, $-$, $*$ and $/$ (integer division).\n\nAlthough there may be multiple valid sets of operators for this equation, Mildra wants to help out by making a program that narrows the possibility space for Gloisa.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line and only line consist of $4$ integers, $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, the values in the expression above.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint out all the expressions that evaluate to true, separated by a newline and sorted alphanumerically. ($\\texttt{`*'} < \\texttt{`+'} < \\texttt{`-'} < \\texttt{`/'}$)\n\nA valid expression must have a space between the integers, operators and the equal sign. Note that expression including division by zero is not a valid expression.\n\nIf none of the expressions are valid, print out \u201cproblems ahead\u201d (without the quotes).\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $0 \\leq a,b,c,d \\leq 100$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 2 3 4\nSample Output 1:\n1 - 2 = 3 - 4\n1 / 2 = 3 / 4\n\nSample Input 2:\n0 4 2 2\nSample Output 2:\n0 * 4 = 2 - 2\n0 + 4 = 2 * 2\n0 + 4 = 2 + 2\n0 / 4 = 2 - 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
