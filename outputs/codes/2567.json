Two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer $i$ such that $a_i = b_i$). For example:  10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position $4$);  10010 and 11111 are similar;  111 and 111 are similar;  0110 and 1001 are not similar. \n\nYou are given an integer $n$ and a binary string $s$ consisting of $2n-1$ characters. Let's denote $s[l..r]$ as the contiguous substring of $s$ starting with $l$-th character and ending with $r$-th character (in other words, $s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} \\dots s_r$).\n\nYou have to construct a binary string $w$ of length $n$ which is similar to all of the following strings: $s[1..n]$, $s[2..n+1]$, $s[3..n+2]$, ..., $s[n..2n-1]$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the binary string $s$ of length $2n - 1$. Each character $s_i$ is either 0 or 1.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the corresponding binary string $w$ of length $n$. If there are multiple such strings \u2014 print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string $w$ meeting the constraints always exists.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1\n1\n3\n00000\n4\n1110000\n2\n101\n\nOutput\n1\n000\n1010\n00\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):\n\nThe first test case:   $\\mathbf{1}$ is similar to $s[1..1] = \\mathbf{1}$. \n\nThe second test case:   $\\mathbf{000}$ is similar to $s[1..3] = \\mathbf{000}$;  $\\mathbf{000}$ is similar to $s[2..4] = \\mathbf{000}$;  $\\mathbf{000}$ is similar to $s[3..5] = \\mathbf{000}$. \n\nThe third test case:   $\\mathbf{1}0\\mathbf{10}$ is similar to $s[1..4] = \\mathbf{1}1\\mathbf{10}$;  $\\mathbf{1}01\\mathbf{0}$ is similar to $s[2..5] = \\mathbf{1}10\\mathbf{0}$;  $\\mathbf{10}1\\mathbf{0}$ is similar to $s[3..6] = \\mathbf{10}0\\mathbf{0}$;  $1\\mathbf{0}1\\mathbf{0}$ is similar to $s[4..7] = 0\\mathbf{0}0\\mathbf{0}$. \n\nThe fourth test case:   $0\\mathbf{0}$ is similar to $s[1..2] = 1\\mathbf{0}$;  $\\mathbf{0}0$ is similar to $s[2..3] = \\mathbf{0}1$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
