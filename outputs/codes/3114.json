These cities are connected, i.e., one can reach from any city $X$ to any other city $Y$ by going through some of these roads. One day, the government wishes to assign for each road a direction, such that one can still reach from any city to any other. You are asked to determine whether this task is possible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of each test case consists of two integers, $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50$), and $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq N(N - 1)/2$). Each of the next $M$ lines describes a road, and consists of two integers, $X$ and $Y$, ($1 \\leq X, Y \\leq N$; $X \\neq Y$), indicating that there is a road between city $X$ and $Y$. There is at most one road that directly connects each pair of cities.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is impossible, output a single line NO. Otherwise, output YES on the first line, followed by $M$ lines describing one possible direction assignment to these $M$ roads. Each of these $M$ lines should consist of two integers, $X$, $Y$, indicating that there is a one-way road from city $X$ to city $Y$. These $M$ lines can be output in any order.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\nSample Output 1:\nYES\n1 3\n2 1\n3 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nSample Output 2:\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
