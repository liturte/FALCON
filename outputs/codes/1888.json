A owes B 20 rubles and B owes C 20 rubles. The total sum of the debts is 40 rubles. You can see that the debts are not organized in a very optimal manner. Let's rearrange them like that: assume that A owes C 20 rubles and B doesn't owe anything to anybody. The debts still mean the same but the total sum of the debts now equals 20 rubles.\n\nThis task is a generalisation of a described example. Imagine that your group of friends has n people and you know the debts between the people. Optimize the given debts without changing their meaning. In other words, finally for each friend the difference between the total money he should give and the total money he should take must be the same. Print the minimum sum of all debts in the optimal rearrangement of the debts. See the notes to the test samples to better understand the problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100;\u00a00 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4). The next m lines contain the debts. The i-th line contains three integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n;\u00a0a_{i} \u2260 b_{i};\u00a01 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 100), which mean that person a_{i} owes person b_{i} c_{i} rubles.\n\nAssume that the people are numbered by integers from 1 to n.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the same pair of people occurs at most once in the input. The input doesn't simultaneously contain pair of people (x, y) and pair of people (y, x).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum sum of debts in the optimal rearrangement.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, you can assume that person number 1 owes 8 rubles to person number 2, 1 ruble to person number 3 and 1 ruble to person number 4. He doesn't owe anybody else anything. In the end, the total debt equals 10.\n\nIn the second sample, there are no debts.\n\nIn the third sample, you can annul all the debts.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
