As the New Year is coming, he wants to make his permutation as pretty as possible.\n\nPermutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is prettier than permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, if and only if there exists an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) where a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_{k} - 1 = b_{k} - 1 and a_{k} < b_{k} all holds.\n\nAs known, permutation p is so sensitive that it could be only modified by swapping two distinct elements. But swapping two elements is harder than you think. Given an n \u00d7 n binary matrix A, user ainta can swap the values of p_{i} and p_{j} (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i \u2260 j) if and only if A_{i}, j = 1.\n\nGiven the permutation p and the matrix A, user ainta wants to know the prettiest permutation that he can obtain.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300) \u2014 the size of the permutation p.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} \u2014 the permutation p that user ainta has. Each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once in the given permutation.\n\nNext n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' and describes the i-th row of A. The j-th character of the i-th line A_{i}, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A. It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, A_{i}, j = A_{j}, i holds. Also, for all integers i where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, A_{i}, i = 0 holds.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, describing the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n5 2 4 3 6 7 1\n0001001\n0000000\n0000010\n1000001\n0000000\n0010000\n1001000\n\nOutput\n1 2 4 3 6 7 5\n\nInput\n5\n4 2 1 5 3\n00100\n00011\n10010\n01101\n01010\n\nOutput\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the swap needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is: (p_1, p_7).\n\nIn the second sample, the swaps needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is (p_1, p_3), (p_4, p_5), (p_3, p_4).  [Image] \n\nA permutation p is a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. The i-th element of the permutation p is denoted as p_{i}. The size of the permutation p is denoted as n.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
