From a given square that has digit $k$ on it, a Move consists of jumping exactly $k$ squares in one of the four cardinal directions. A move cannot go beyond the edges of the grid; it does not wrap. What is the minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner?\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 500$), indicating the size of the grid. It is guaranteed that at least one of $n$ and $m$ is greater than $1$.\n\nThe next $n$ lines will each consist of $m$ digits, with no spaces, indicating the $n \\times m$ grid. Each digit is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nThe top-left corner of the grid will be the square corresponding to the first character in the first line of the test case. The bottom-right corner of the grid will be the square corresponding to the last character in the last line of the test case.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer on a line by itself representing the minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right. If it isn\u2019t possible, output -1.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 2\n11\n11\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 2\n22\n22\nSample Output 2:\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
