But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that $a$ yuan for $b$ kilos (You don't need to care about what \"yuan\" is), the same as $a/b$ yuan for a kilo.\n\nNow imagine you'd like to buy $m$ kilos of apples. You've asked $n$ supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.\n\nYou can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\,000$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 100$), denoting that there are $n$ supermarkets and you want to buy $m$ kilos of apples.\n\nThe following $n$ lines describe the information of the supermarkets. Each line contains two positive integers $a, b$ ($1 \\leq a, b \\leq 100$), denoting that in this supermarket, you are supposed to pay $a$ yuan for $b$ kilos of apples.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line, denoting the minimum cost for $m$ kilos of apples. Please make sure that the absolute or relative error between your answer and the correct answer won't exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\nFormally, let your answer be $x$, and the jury's answer be $y$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|x - y|}{\\max{(1, |y|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n1 2\n3 4\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1.66666667\n\nInput\n2 1\n99 100\n98 99\n\nOutput\n0.98989899\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, you are supposed to buy $5$ kilos of apples in supermarket $3$. The cost is $5/3$ yuan.\n\nIn the second sample, you are supposed to buy $1$ kilo of apples in supermarket $2$. The cost is $98/99$ yuan.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
