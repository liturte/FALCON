The balls of the same color cannot be distinguished. Snuke and Takahashi are playing with these balls.\nFirst, Snuke will arrange the N balls in a row from left to right.\nThen, Takahashi will collect only the K blue balls. In one move, he can collect any number of consecutive blue balls. He will collect all the blue balls in the fewest moves possible.\nHow many ways are there for Snuke to arrange the N balls in a row so that Takahashi will need exactly i moves to collect all the blue balls? Compute this number modulo 10^9+7 for each i such that 1 \\leq i \\leq K.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 2000\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint K lines. The i-th line (1 \\leq i \\leq K) should contain the number of ways to arrange the N balls so that Takahashi will need exactly i moves to collect all the blue balls, modulo 10^9+7.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5 3\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n6\n1\n\nThere are three ways to arrange the balls so that Takahashi will need exactly one move: (B, B, B, R, R), (R, B, B, B, R), and (R, R, B, B, B). (R and B stands for red and blue, respectively).\nThere are six ways to arrange the balls so that Takahashi will need exactly two moves: (B, B, R, B, R), (B, B, R, R, B), (R, B, B, R, B), (R, B, R, B, B), (B, R, B, B, R), and (B, R, R, B, B).\nThere is one way to arrange the balls so that Takahashi will need exactly three moves: (B, R, B, R, B).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
