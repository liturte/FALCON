Initially the memory of the mechanism is filled with n strings. Then the mechanism should be able to process queries of the following type: \"Given string s, determine if the memory of the mechanism contains string t that consists of the same number of characters as s and differs from s in exactly one position\".\n\nWatto has already compiled the mechanism, all that's left is to write a program for it and check it on the data consisting of n initial lines and m queries. He decided to entrust this job to you.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two non-negative numbers n and m (0 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of the initial strings and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nNext follow n non-empty strings that are uploaded to the memory of the mechanism.\n\nNext follow m non-empty strings that are the queries to the mechanism.\n\nThe total length of lines in the input doesn't exceed 6\u00b710^5. Each line consists only of letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query print on a single line \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the memory of the mechanism contains the required string, otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\naaaaa\nacacaca\naabaa\nccacacc\ncaaac\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
