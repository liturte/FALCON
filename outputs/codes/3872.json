Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:   They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a_1 and a_2, and string b into two halves of the same size b_1 and b_2, then one of the following is correct:   a_1 is equivalent to b_1, and a_2 is equivalent to b_2  a_1 is equivalent to b_2, and a_2 is equivalent to b_1  \n\nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200 000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\naaba\nabaa\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\naabb\nabab\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
