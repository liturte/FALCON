A binary decision diagram (BDD) over these variables is a diagrammatic representation of a boolean function $f(x_0, \\ldots , x_{n-1})$ as inputs.\n\nA BDD is a rooted binary tree such that all internal vertices $v$ have precisely two children. The edges connecting an internal vertex $v$ with its children are labelled with a $0$ or $1$ (exactly one of each). Each leaf vertex is also labelled with a $0$ or $1$. We note that a BDD may consist of a single vertex, which is considered to be both the root and a leaf vertex.\n\nGiven input $(x_0, \\ldots , x_{n-1})$, the boolean function represented by the BDD is evaluated as follows.\n - let $v$ be the root vertex\n - let $i \\leftarrow 0$\n - while $v$ is not a leaf do\n - replace $v$ with the child vertex of $v$ by traversing the edge labelled $x_ i$\n - increase $i$ by $1$\n - output the label of leaf vertex $v$\n\nConsider the function $f(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ represented by the BDD above. To evaluate $f(1,0,1)$, we start from the root, we descend along edges labelled $1$, $0$, and then $1$. We reach a leaf vertex labelled $1$, so $f(1,0,1) = 1$.\n\nA BDD is minimal if there is no way to replace any subtree of an internal vertex of the BDD by a single leaf vertex to get a new BDD defining the same boolean function. The BDD depicted above is minimal. It is a fact that for each boolean function $f$, there is a unique minimal BDD that represents the boolean function.\n\nIn this problem, you are given an $n$-variable boolean function specified by a list of the $2^n$ different values the function should take for various inputs. Compute the number of vertices in the minimal BDD representing this function.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 18$. Then one more line follows that contains $2^n$ values (either $0$ or $1$) describing an $n$-variable boolean function.\n\nWe think of these values as being indexed from $0$ to $2^n-1$. The $i$th such value represents $f(x_0, \\ldots , x_{n-1})$ where $x_ j$ is the $j$th least-significant bit of the binary representation of $i$. In other words, $x_ j$ is the coefficient of $2^j$ in the binary expansion of $i$.\n\nThe third sample input below corresponds to the BDD depicted above.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput consists of a single integer $m$ that is the number of vertices in the unique minimal BDD representing the boolean function from the input.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n1 1 0 1\nSample Output 1:\n5\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n0 0 0 0\nSample Output 2:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
