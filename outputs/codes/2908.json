In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that add up to a given sum. However, to make things more interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below) means that certain cards will display different numbers if turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of the cards if necessary to generate the sum. Please help Simon win the game!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers, $n$, the number of cards, and $s$, the desired sum. The second line will contain $n$ integers between $1$ and $100000000$ inclusive. You may assume that $1\\leq n\\leq 100000$ and $2\\leq s\\leq 200000000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should be a single line consisting of the string YES if two cards can be chosen such that (in some orientation) they add up to $s$, and the string NO otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 66\n15 21 22\nSample Output:\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
