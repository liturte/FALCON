This string is known for you and given in the input.\n\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\n\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\n\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \n\nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\n\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then $q$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines:  the first line contains string $s$, which has a length from $1$ to $50$ and consists of lowercase English letters;  the second line contains positive integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le |s|$), where $|s|$ is the length of the string $s$, and $m$ is the length of the array $b$;  the third line contains the integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$ ($0 \\le b_i \\le 1225$). \n\nIt is guaranteed that in each test case an answer exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $q$ lines: the $k$-th of them should contain the answer (string $t$) to the $k$-th test case. It is guaranteed that an answer to each test case exists. If there are several answers, output any.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\nabac\n3\n2 1 0\nabc\n1\n0\nabba\n3\n1 0 1\necoosdcefr\n10\n38 13 24 14 11 5 3 24 17 0\n\nOutput\naac\nb\naba\ncodeforces\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, such strings $t$ are suitable: \"aac', \"aab\".\n\nIn the second test case, such trings $t$ are suitable: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\".\n\nIn the third test case, only the string $t$ equals to \"aba\" is suitable, but the character 'b' can be from the second or third position.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
