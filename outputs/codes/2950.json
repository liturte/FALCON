Originally the plan was to accomplish this with controlled explosions, one for each tower block, but time constraints now require a hastier solution.\n\nTo help you remove the blocks more rapidly you have been given the use of a Universal Kinetic / Incandescent Energy Particle Cannon (UKIEPC). On a single charge, this cutting-edge contraption can remove either all of the floors in a single tower block, or all the $x$-th floors in all the blocks simultaneously, for user\u2019s choice of the floor number $x$. In the latter case, the blocks that are less than $x$ floors high are left untouched, while for blocks having more than $x$ floors, all the floors above the removed $x$-th one fall down by one level.\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven the number of floors of all towers, output the minimum number of charges needed to eliminate all floors of all blocks.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the number of blocks $n$, where $2 \\leq n \\leq 100000$. The second line contains $n$ consecutive block heights $h_ i$ for $i=1,2,\\ldots ,n$, where $1 \\leq h_ i \\leq 1000000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line containing one integer: the minimum number of charges needed to tear down all the blocks.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6\n2 1 8 8 2 3\nSample Output:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
