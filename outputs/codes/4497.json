Among the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), find the one that can be divisible by 2 for the most number of times. The solution is always unique.\nHere, the number of times an integer can be divisible by 2, is how many times the integer can be divided by 2 without remainder.\nFor example,\n - 6 can be divided by 2 once: 6 -> 3.\n - 8 can be divided by 2 three times: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.\n - 3 can be divided by 2 zero times.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the answer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n7\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4\n\n4 can be divided by 2 twice, which is the most number of times among 1, 2, ..., 7.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
