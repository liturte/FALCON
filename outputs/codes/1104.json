Let's denote the elements of the first sequence as $a_i$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 3$), and the elements of the second sequence as $b_i$ ($0 \\le b_i \\le 3$).\n\nMasha became interested if or not there is an integer sequence of length $n$, which elements we will denote as $t_i$ ($0 \\le t_i \\le 3$), so that for every $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n - 1$) the following is true:   $a_i = t_i | t_{i + 1}$ (where $|$ denotes the bitwise OR operation) and  $b_i = t_i \\& t_{i + 1}$ (where $\\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation). \n\nThe question appeared to be too difficult for Masha, so now she asked you to check whether such a sequence $t_i$ of length $n$ exists. If it exists, find such a sequence. If there are multiple such sequences, find any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence $t_i$. \n\nThe second line contains $n - 1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 3$)\u00a0\u2014 the first sequence on the blackboard.\n\nThe third line contains $n - 1$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{n-1}$ ($0 \\le b_i \\le 3$)\u00a0\u2014 the second sequence on the blackboard.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes), if there is a sequence $t_i$ that satisfies the conditions from the statements, and \"NO\" (without quotes), if there is no such sequence.\n\nIf there is such a sequence, on the second line print $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n$ ($0 \\le t_i \\le 3$)\u00a0\u2014 the sequence that satisfies the statements conditions.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n3 3 2\n1 2 0\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 3 2 0 \nInput\n3\n1 3\n3 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it's easy to see that the sequence from output satisfies the given conditions:   $t_1 | t_2 = (01_2) | (11_2) = (11_2) = 3 = a_1$ and $t_1 \\& t_2 = (01_2) \\& (11_2) = (01_2) = 1 = b_1$;  $t_2 | t_3 = (11_2) | (10_2) = (11_2) = 3 = a_2$ and $t_2 \\& t_3 = (11_2) \\& (10_2) = (10_2) = 2 = b_2$;  $t_3 | t_4 = (10_2) | (00_2) = (10_2) = 2 = a_3$ and $t_3 \\& t_4 = (10_2) \\& (00_2) = (00_2) = 0 = b_3$. \n\nIn the second example there is no such sequence.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
