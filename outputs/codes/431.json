As a hausmeister of DHBW, Sagheer waits till all students and professors leave the university building, then goes and turns all the lights off.\n\nThe building consists of n floors with stairs at the left and the right sides. Each floor has m rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with n rows and m + 2 columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the m columns in the middle represent rooms.\n\nSagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off. It takes one minute for Sagheer to go to the next floor using stairs or to move from the current room/stairs to a neighboring room/stairs on the same floor. It takes no time for him to switch the light off in the room he is currently standing in. Help Sagheer find the minimum total time to turn off all the lights.\n\nNote that Sagheer does not have to go back to his starting position, and he does not have to visit rooms where the light is already switched off.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 15 and 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively.\n\nThe next n lines contains the building description. Each line contains a binary string of length m + 2 representing a floor (the left stairs, then m rooms, then the right stairs) where 0 indicates that the light is off and 1 indicates that the light is on. The floors are listed from top to bottom, so that the last line represents the ground floor.\n\nThe first and last characters of each string represent the left and the right stairs, respectively, so they are always 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum total time needed to turn off all the lights.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\n0010\n0100\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n3 4\n001000\n000010\n000010\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n4 3\n01110\n01110\n01110\n01110\n\nOutput\n18\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Sagheer will go to room 1 in the ground floor, then he will go to room 2 in the second floor using the left or right stairs.\n\nIn the second example, he will go to the fourth room in the ground floor, use right stairs, go to the fourth room in the second floor, use right stairs again, then go to the second room in the last floor.\n\nIn the third example, he will walk through the whole corridor alternating between the left and right stairs at each floor.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
