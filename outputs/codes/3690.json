Misha had. And this time he has a really strong excuse: he faced a space-time paradox! Space and time replaced each other.\n\nThe entire universe turned into an enormous clock face with three hands\u00a0\u2014 hour, minute, and second. Time froze, and clocks now show the time h hours, m minutes, s seconds.\n\nLast time Misha talked with the coordinator at t_1 o'clock, so now he stands on the number t_1 on the clock face. The contest should be ready by t_2 o'clock. In the terms of paradox it means that Misha has to go to number t_2 somehow. Note that he doesn't have to move forward only: in these circumstances time has no direction.\n\nClock hands are very long, and Misha cannot get round them. He also cannot step over as it leads to the collapse of space-time. That is, if hour clock points 12 and Misha stands at 11 then he cannot move to 1 along the top arc. He has to follow all the way round the clock center (of course, if there are no other hands on his way).\n\nGiven the hands' positions, t_1, and t_2, find if Misha can prepare the contest on time (or should we say on space?). That is, find if he can move from t_1 to t_2 by the clock face.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFive integers h, m, s, t_1, t_2 (1 \u2264 h \u2264 12, 0 \u2264 m, s \u2264 59, 1 \u2264 t_1, t_2 \u2264 12, t_1 \u2260 t_2).\n\nMisha's position and the target time do not coincide with the position of any hand.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (quotes for clarity), if Misha can prepare the contest on time, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print each character either upper- or lowercase (\"YeS\" and \"yes\" are valid when the answer is \"YES\").\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n12 30 45 3 11\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n12 0 1 12 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3 47 0 4 9\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe three examples are shown on the pictures below from left to right. The starting position of Misha is shown with green, the ending position is shown with pink. Note that the positions of the hands on the pictures are not exact, but are close to the exact and the answer is the same. $\\oplus 0 \\theta$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
