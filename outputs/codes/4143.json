A train can occupy at most A people.\n - Bus: travels from City 2 to 3 in one minute. A bus can occupy at most B people.\n - Taxi: travels from City 3 to 4 in one minute. A taxi can occupy at most C people.\n - Airplane: travels from City 4 to 5 in one minute. An airplane can occupy at most D people.\n - Ship: travels from City 5 to 6 in one minute. A ship can occupy at most E people.\nFor each of them, one vehicle leaves the city at each integer time (time 0, 1, 2, ...).\nThere is a group of N people at City 1, and they all want to go to City 6.\n\nAt least how long does it take for all of them to reach there? \nYou can ignore the time needed to transfer.  \n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N, A, B, C, D, E \\leq 10^{15}\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum time required for all of the people to reach City 6, in minutes.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5\n3\n2\n4\n3\n5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n\nOne possible way to travel is as follows.\nFirst, there are N = 5 people at City 1, as shown in the following image:\n\nIn the first minute, three people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train. Note that a train can only occupy at most three people.\n\nIn the second minute, the remaining two people travels from City 1 to City 2 by train, and two of the three people who were already at City 2 travels to City 3 by bus. Note that a bus can only occupy at most two people.\n\nIn the third minute, two people travels from City 2 to City 3 by train, and another two people travels from City 3 to City 4 by taxi.\n\nFrom then on, if they continue traveling without stopping until they reach City 6, all of them can reach there in seven minutes.\n\nThere is no way for them to reach City 6 in 6 minutes or less.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
