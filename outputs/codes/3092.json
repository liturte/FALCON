The cities are numbered $1$ through $N$. For each road we know the origin and destination cities, as well as its length.\n\nWe say that the road $F$ is a continuation of road $E$ if the destination city of road $E$ is the same as the origin city of road $F$. A path from city $A$ to city $B$ is a sequence of road such that origin of the first road is city $A$, each other road is a continuation of the one before it, and the destination of the last road is city $B$. The length of the path is the sum of lengths of all roads in it.\n\nA path from $A$ to $B$ is a shortest path if there is no other path from $A$ to $B$ that is shorter in length.\n\nYour task is to, for each road, output how many different shortest paths contain that road, modulo $1000000007$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$ $(1 \\le N \\le 1500, 1 \\le M \\le 5000)$, the number of cities and roads.\n\nEach of the following $M$ lines contains three positive integers $O$, $D$ and $L$. These represent a one-way road from city $O$ to city $D$ of length $L$. The numbers $O$ and $D$ will be different and $L$ will be at most $10000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $M$ integers each on its own line \u2013 for each road, the number of different shortest paths containing it, modulo $1000000007$. The order of these numbers should match the order of roads in the input.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n1 2 5\n2 3 5\n3 4 5\nSample Output 1:\n3\n4\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n1 2 5\n2 3 5\n3 4 5\n1 4 8\nSample Output 2:\n2\n3\n2\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
