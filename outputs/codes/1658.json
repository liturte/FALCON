The Sith Lord loves counting the number of nodes in the tree that are at a distance at most x from the root. The distance is the sum of the lengths of edges on the path between nodes.\n\nBut he has got used to this activity and even grew bored of it. 'Why does he do that, then?' \u2014 you may ask. It's just that he feels superior knowing that only he can solve this problem. \n\nDo you want to challenge Darth Vader himself? Count the required number of nodes. As the answer can be rather large, find it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of children of each node and the distance from the root within the range of which you need to count the nodes.\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers d_{i} (1 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the edge that connects each node with its i-th child.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of vertexes in the tree at distance from the root equal to at most x. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nPictures to the sample (the yellow color marks the nodes the distance to which is at most three) [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
