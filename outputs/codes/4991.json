Although this theory has never been proven, the conjecture is known as the Collatz Conjecture (named after Lothar Collatz, who posed the idea in 1937). Given an integer, $n\\geqslant 1$, this conjecture pertains to the sequence $h(n)$, which we recursively define as follows:\n - If $n=1$, the sequence is composed of a single integer: $1$\n - If $n$ is even, the sequence is composed of $n$ followed by sequence $h(n/2)$\n - If $n$ is odd, the sequence is composed of $n$ followed by sequence $h(3\\cdot n + 1)$\n\nFor example, the following are the sequences for the numbers $5$ and $7$:\n\n$h(5) = (5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)$\n\n$h(7) = (7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)$\n\nThe $h(n)$ sequence is commonly known as the hailstone sequence, because of its nature of going up and down like a hailstone in a cloud before eventually falling to Earth. In this problem, you will calculate the sum of all the values in a hailstone sequence. Using the sequences above, the sum of $h(5)$ is $36$ and the sum of $h(7)$ is $288$.\n\nYour solution must use a RECURSIVE function,\n\n based on the recursive definition of $h(n)$ presented above.\n\nOn the exam, any other type of solution will receive zero points!\n\nEVEN IF KATTIS JUDGES IT AS CORRECT!\n\nNote: You are allowed to add up the numbers iteratively, as long as the $h(n)$ sequence is computed recursively.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single positive integer, $n$ ($0 < n \\leqslant 2^{32}-1$).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains a single integer: the sum of all the values in $h(n)$. You may assume that this sum will fit in an unsigned 64-bit integer.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\nSample Output:\n36\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
