You are free to choose from a number of weekends this autumn, and have to find a suitable hotel to stay at, preferably as cheap as possible. \n\nYou have some constraints: The total cost of the trip must be within budget, of course. All participants must stay at the same hotel, to avoid last years catastrophe, where some members got lost in the city, never being seen again.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of four integers: $1 \\leq N \\leq 200$, the number of participants, $1 \\leq B \\leq 500000$, the budget, $1 \\leq H \\leq 18$, the number of hotels to consider, and $1 \\leq W \\leq 13$, the number of weeks you can choose between. Then follow two lines for each of the $H$ hotels. The first gives $1 \\leq p \\leq 10000$, the price for one person staying the weekend at the hotel. The second contains $W$ integers, $0 \\leq a \\leq 1000$, giving the number of available beds for each weekend at the hotel.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum cost of the stay for your group, or \u201cstay home\u201d if nothing can be found within the budget.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 1000 2 3\n200\n0 2 2\n300\n27 3 20\nSample Output:\n900\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
