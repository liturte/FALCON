He remembered that he had a set of n sticks and an instrument. Each stick is characterized by its length l_{i}.\n\nIlya decided to make a rectangle from the sticks. And due to his whim, he decided to make rectangles in such a way that maximizes their total area. Each stick is used in making at most one rectangle, it is possible that some of sticks remain unused. Bending sticks is not allowed.\n\nSticks with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3 and a_4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed:  a_1 \u2264 a_2 \u2264 a_3 \u2264 a_4  a_1 = a_2  a_3 = a_4 \n\nA rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of, for example, 3\u00a03\u00a03\u00a03 or 2\u00a02\u00a04\u00a04. A rectangle cannot be made of, for example, sticks 5\u00a05\u00a05\u00a07.\n\nIlya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks. The sticks are made of a special material, so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one. For example, a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4.\n\nYou have to answer the question \u2014 what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of the available sticks.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n positive integers l_{i} (2 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the lengths of the sticks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of the output must contain a single non-negative integer\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the maximum total area of the rectangles that Ilya can make from the available sticks.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 4 4 2\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n4\n2 2 3 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4\n100003 100004 100005 100006\n\nOutput\n10000800015\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
