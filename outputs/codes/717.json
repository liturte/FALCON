He is going visit n doctors to find out the exact diagnosis. Each of the doctors needs the information about all previous visits, so Borya has to visit them in the prescribed order (i.e. Borya should first visit doctor 1, then doctor 2, then doctor 3 and so on). Borya will get the information about his health from the last doctor.\n\nDoctors have a strange working schedule. The doctor i goes to work on the s_{i}-th day and works every d_{i} day. So, he works on days s_{i}, s_{i} + d_{i}, s_{i} + 2d_{i}, ....\n\nThe doctor's appointment takes quite a long time, so Borya can not see more than one doctor per day.
