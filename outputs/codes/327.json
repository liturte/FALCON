The bag contains n sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from 1 to n corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness.\n\nThe choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones\u00a0\u2014 but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!\n\nA xor-sum of a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: $a_{1} \\oplus a_{2} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{m}$, here $\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found here.\n\nDed Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than k candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe sole string contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^18).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one number\u00a0\u2014 the largest possible xor-sum.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n6 6\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, one optimal answer is 1, 2 and 4, giving the xor-sum of 7.\n\nIn the second sample case, one can, for example, take all six candies and obtain the xor-sum of 7.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
