A permutation of length n is a sequence of distinct positive integers, each is at most n.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that value gcd(a, b) shows the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. Levko assumes that element p_{i} of permutation p_1, p_2, ... , p_{n} is good if gcd(i, p_{i}) > 1. Levko considers a permutation beautiful, if it has exactly k good elements. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print either any beautiful permutation or -1, if such permutation doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf there are multiple suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2\n\nOutput\n2 4 3 1\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample elements 4 and 3 are good because gcd(2, 4) = 2 > 1 and gcd(3, 3) = 3 > 1. Elements 2 and 1 are not good because gcd(1, 2) = 1 and gcd(4, 1) = 1. As there are exactly 2 good elements, the permutation is beautiful.\n\nThe second sample has no beautiful permutations.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
