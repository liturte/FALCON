Since they love winter, they want to visit the Southern Hemisphere, in particular Chile. Chile is, geographically speaking, a rather one-dimensional country, and can be represented as an infinitely long $y$-axis. There are $N$ cities in Chile, numbered from $1$ to $N$, where the $i$th city is located at $y$-coordinate $y_ i$. Alice and Bob will start their journey in city number $1$, and travel to some other city from there.\n\nEach city has an airport with a direct connection to other cities. However, flights cannot be arbitrarily short: For each city $i$ there is a minimal distance $d_ i$ such that there is a flight to city $j$ if and only if $|y_ i-y_ j|\\geq d_ i$. The time for a flight is $|y_ i - y_ j|$ minutes, but it also takes time to travel to the airport, check in, pass security, etc. Thus, for each city there is an additional time $r_ i$ such that the total time to fly from $i$ to $j$ is $r_ i + |y_ i - y_ j|$ minutes.\n\nFind the shortest possible time to get to each of the other cities, provided that Alice and Bob start in city\u00a0$1$. Flights are the only means of transportation, but Alice and Bob can take as many flights as they like.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$, the number of cities, where $2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$. The following $N$ lines each consist of three integers $y_ i$, $d_ i$, and $r_ i$, where $0 \\leq y_ i, d_ i, r_ i \\leq 10^9$. All $y$-coordinates are distinct.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint $N-1$ lines, each containing an integer. On the $i$th line, print the shortest possible total time for getting from city\u00a01 to city\u00a0$i+1$, if possible. If there is no way to get to city $i+1$, print $-1$ instead.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\n1 3 2\n2 5 2\n3 0 0\n4 2 4\n5 3 0\nSample Output:\n9\n-1\n5\n6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
