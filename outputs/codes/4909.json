The Cu Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns in the 1960s. Nowadays, it is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThere are documents from trusted sources about a private network of tunnels in this area used by a secret forces unit but it has not been discovered. According to the documents, this private network has $N$ rooms (numbered from $1$ to $N$) connected by $N-1$ bidirectional tunnels. Room $1$ is the entry point from the ground surface to this underground network. From room $1$, you can follow the tunnels to go to any of the rooms. The rooms are numbered in such a way that, if you follow the shortest path from room $1$ to any room $X$, the sequence of visited rooms\u2019 indices will be increasing. The image below shows a valid map of this network.\n\nThe network below is invalid, since the path from $1$ to $4$ is $1$ - $3$ - $2$ - $4$, which is not increasing:\n\nThere is also an old article from an unknown source mentioning about $D_ i$ which is the number of rooms directly connected to room $i$.\n\nGiven an array $D$ of size $N$, your task is to verify if it is possible to have such a network.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line contains an integer $N$ - the number of rooms in the network $(2 \\leq N \\leq 1000)$.\n - The second line consists of $N$ integers $D_ i$ - the number of rooms that are directly connected to room $i$ $(1 \\leq D_ i \\leq N - 1)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint YES/NO if it is possible/impossible to have such a network, respectively.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n8\n3 2 2 1 1 3 1 1\nSample Output:\nYES\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
