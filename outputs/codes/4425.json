He will play the following game with them:\n - Throw the die. The current score is the result of the die.\n - As long as the score is between 1 and K-1 (inclusive), keep flipping the coin. The score is doubled each time the coin lands heads up, and the score becomes 0 if the coin lands tails up.\n - The game ends when the score becomes 0 or becomes K or above. Snuke wins if the score is K or above, and loses if the score is 0.\nYou are given N and K. Find the probability that Snuke wins the game.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n - 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^5\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the probability that Snuke wins the game.

The probability of this happening is \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{48}.\n - If the die shows 2, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{1}{24}.\n - If the die shows 3, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is \\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{12}.\nThus, the probability that Snuke wins is \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{7}{48} \\simeq 0.1458333333.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
