For each visitor Denis himself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so, Denis is guided by the following rules:  every visitor should receive at least one dish (dumplings, cranberry juice, pancakes with condensed milk are all considered to be dishes);  each visitor should receive no more than one portion of dumplings, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one pancake with condensed milk;  all visitors should receive different sets of dishes. \n\nWhat is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 500$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases to solve.\n\nEach of the remaining $t$ lines contains integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($0 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 10$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of portions of dumplings, the number of portions of cranberry juice and the number of condensed milk pancakes Denis made.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n1 2 1\n0 0 0\n9 1 7\n2 2 3\n2 3 2\n3 2 2\n4 4 4\n\nOutput\n3\n0\n4\n5\n5\n5\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, Denis can feed the first visitor with dumplings, give the second a portion of cranberry juice, and give the third visitor a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with a condensed milk.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, the restaurant Denis is not very promising: he can serve no customers.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, Denise can serve four visitors. The first guest will receive a full lunch of dumplings, a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with condensed milk. The second visitor will get only dumplings. The third guest will receive a pancake with condensed milk, and the fourth guest will receive a pancake and a portion of dumplings. Please note that Denis hasn't used all of the prepared products, but is unable to serve more visitors.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
