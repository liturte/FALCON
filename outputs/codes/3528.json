Mirko hammered the nails into the board as fast as possible. The board can be modeled by a coordinate plane and the nails as points in it. No two nails have the same $x$- or the same $y$-coordinate.\n\nIn order to keep having fun, Mirko stole his sister\u2019s elastic hair band, spread it over all nails and then let go. The elastic, naturally, tightened around the nails.\n\nMirko then repeats these steps while there are at least three nails in the board:\n - Write down the area of the shape enclosed by the hair band.\n - Picks the leftmost, rightmost, topmost or bottommost nail in the board.\n - Remove the chosen nail from the board; the elastic tightens again around the remaining nails.\n\nWrite a program that calculates the numbers written in step 1 of each iteration, if we know the nail Mirko picks in step 2 of each iteration.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $N$ $(3 \\leq N \\leq 300000)$, the number of nails.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains two integers separated by a space, the coordinates of a nail. All coordinates will be between 1 and $1000000000$. No two nails will share the same $x$- or $y$-coordinate. The next line contains $N-2$ letters \u2019L\u2019, \u2019R\u2019, \u2019U\u2019 or \u2019D\u2019. The letters represent the nails Mirko picked in order:\n - \u2019L\u2019 for the leftmost nail (smallest $x$-coordinate),\n - \u2019R\u2019 for the rightmost nail (largest $x$-coordinate),\n - \u2019U\u2019 for the topmost nail (largest $y$-coordinate),\n - \u2019D\u2019 for the bottommost nail (smallest $y$-coordinate).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $N-2$ numbers, each on a separate line. The numbers are, in order, the areas that Mirko wrote down. Output numbers with one digit after the decimal point.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\n1 4\n2 2\n4 1\n3 5\n5 3\nLUR\nSample Output:\n9.0\n6.5\n2.5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
