However, before we go through that effort, it would be nice to know whether the boxes we have are the right size!\n\nA box has three dimensions, $l$, $w$, and $h$, and a box\u2019s volume $v$ is simply $l\\cdot w \\cdot h$. We have many small items to pack, and we don\u2019t care about their exact geometry: we know that, as long as a box has a volume of, at least, $\\mathbf{V}$, we will be able to pack all those items into that single box. So, given a box $i$, and its volume $v_ i$, then the difference $d_ i=v_ i-\\mathbf{V}$ can tell us whether the box is big enough or not to pack all the items. If $d_ i$ is greater than or equal to zero, the box is big enough; otherwise, the box is too small.\n\nSo, we want to answer a simple question: given multiple boxes, is the largest box (by volume) large enough to store all our items? For example, suppose $\\mathbf{V}=10$ and we have three boxes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, with dimensions $(1,1,2)$, $(2,2,2)$, and $(3,2,1)$, respectively. Their volumes will be $v_ A=2$, $v_ B=8$, and $v_ C=6$, which means the largest box is $B$. Unfortunately, $d_ B=v_ B-\\mathbf{V}=8-10=-2$, which means our largest box is not large enough.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose $\\mathbf{V}=980$, and we had four boxes, $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ with dimensions $(10,10,10)$, $(10,5,2)$, $(5,3,2)$, and $(90,5,2)$, respectively. Their volumes will be $v_ W=1000$, $v_ X=100$, $v_ Y=30$ and $v_ Z=900$, making $W$ the largest box and, since $d_ W=v_ W-\\mathbf{V}=1000-980=20$, that means $W$ is big enough for all our items.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input specifies a set of boxes. It begins with a line containing two integers: $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$), specifying the number of boxes, and $\\mathbf{V}$, as defined above. The remaining input is composed of $n$ lines, each specifying one box. Each line contains the dimensions $l$, $w$, and $h$ for the box. You may assume that $1 \\leqslant l, w, h, \\mathbf{V} < 2^{32}$. You may also assume that, for any given box $i$, its volume $v_ i$ will always be less than\u00a0$2^{32}$\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is a single integer: the value of $d_ i$ for the largest box by volume.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 10\n1 1 2\n2 2 2\n3 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n-2\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 30\n1 1 1\n5 2 3\n5 2 1\nSample Output 2:\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
