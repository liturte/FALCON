His MeTube channel has recently reached $100$ million subscribers. In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?\n\nYou're given a tree \u2014 a connected undirected graph consisting of $n$ vertices connected by $n - 1$ edges. The tree is rooted at vertex $1$. A vertex $u$ is called an ancestor of $v$ if it lies on the shortest path between the root and $v$. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.\n\nEach vertex $v$ is assigned its beauty $x_v$ \u2014 a non-negative integer not larger than $10^{12}$. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let $u$ be an ancestor of $v$. Then we define the beauty $f(u, v)$ as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. Formally, if $u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \\dots, t_k=v$ are the vertices on the shortest path between $u$ and $v$, then $f(u, v) = \\gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \\dots, x_{t_k})$. Here, $\\gcd$ denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, $f(u, u) = \\gcd(x_u) = x_u$.\n\nYour task is to find the sum\n\n$$ \\sum_{u\\text{ is an ancestor of }v} f(u, v). $$\n\nAs the result might be too large, please output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nNote that for each $y$, $\\gcd(0, y) = \\gcd(y, 0) = y$. In particular, $\\gcd(0, 0) = 0$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following line contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ ($0 \\le x_i \\le 10^{12}$). The value $x_v$ denotes the beauty of vertex $v$.\n\nThe following $n - 1$ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each of them contains two integers $a, b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le n$, $a \\neq b$) \u2014 the vertices connected by a single edge.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the sum of the beauties on all paths $(u, v)$ such that $u$ is ancestor of $v$. This sum should be printed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 5 6 0 8\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n42\n\nInput\n7\n0 2 3 0 0 0 0\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n\nOutput\n30\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe following figure shows all $10$ possible paths for which one endpoint is an ancestor of another endpoint.
