The topmost book has number $a_1$, the next one \u2014 $a_2$, and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number $a_n$. All numbers are distinct.\n\nVasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in $n$ steps. During $i$-th step he wants to move the book number $b_i$ into his backpack. If the book with number $b_i$ is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book $b_i$, and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order $[1, 2, 3]$ (book $1$ is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order $[2, 1, 3]$, then during the first step he will move two books ($1$ and $2$), during the second step he will do nothing (since book $1$ is already in the backpack), and during the third step \u2014 one book (the book number $3$). Note that $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ are distinct.\n\nHelp Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n~(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ \u2014 the number of books in the stack.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n~(1 \\le a_i \\le n)$ denoting the stack of books.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n~(1 \\le b_i \\le n)$ denoting the steps Vasya is going to perform.\n\nAll numbers $a_1 \\dots a_n$ are distinct, the same goes for $b_1 \\dots b_n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n$ integers. The $i$-th of them should be equal to the number of books Vasya moves to his backpack during the $i$-th step.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n2 1 3\n\nOutput\n2 0 1 \n\nInput\n5\n3 1 4 2 5\n4 5 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n3 2 0 0 0 \n\nInput\n6\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n6 5 3 4 2 1\n\nOutput\n1 1 2 0 1 1 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described in the statement.\n\nIn the second example, during the first step Vasya will move the books $[3, 1, 4]$. After that only books $2$ and $5$ remain in the stack ($2$ is above $5$). During the second step Vasya will take the books $2$ and $5$. After that the stack becomes empty, so during next steps Vasya won't move any books.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
