In each round, both players show one of the following things at the same time: rock, paper or scissors. If both players showed the same things then the round outcome is a draw. Otherwise, the following rules applied:\n\n  if one player showed rock and the other one showed scissors, then the player who showed rock is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed scissors and the other one showed paper, then the player who showed scissors is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed paper and the other one showed rock, then the player who showed paper is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser. \n\nAlice and Bob decided to play exactly $n$ rounds of the game described above. Alice decided to show rock $a_1$ times, show scissors $a_2$ times and show paper $a_3$ times. Bob decided to show rock $b_1$ times, show scissors $b_2$ times and show paper $b_3$ times. Though, both Alice and Bob did not choose the sequence in which they show things. It is guaranteed that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n$ and $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n$.\n\nYour task is to find two numbers:\n\n  the minimum number of round Alice can win;  the maximum number of rounds Alice can win. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{9}$) \u2014 the number of rounds.\n\nThe second line of the input contains three integers $a_1, a_2, a_3$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le n$) \u2014 the number of times Alice will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n$.\n\nThe third line of the input contains three integers $b_1, b_2, b_3$ ($0 \\le b_j \\le n$) \u2014 the number of times Bob will show rock, scissors and paper, respectively. It is guaranteed that $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers: the minimum and the maximum number of rounds Alice can win.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n0 1 1\n1 1 0\n\nOutput\n0 1\n\nInput\n15\n5 5 5\n5 5 5\n\nOutput\n0 15\n\nInput\n3\n0 0 3\n3 0 0\n\nOutput\n3 3\n\nInput\n686\n479 178 29\n11 145 530\n\nOutput\n22 334\n\nInput\n319\n10 53 256\n182 103 34\n\nOutput\n119 226\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Alice will not win any rounds if she shows scissors and then paper and Bob shows rock and then scissors. In the best outcome, Alice will win one round if she shows paper and then scissors, and Bob shows rock and then scissors.\n\nIn the second example, Alice will not win any rounds if Bob shows the same things as Alice each round.\n\nIn the third example, Alice always shows paper and Bob always shows rock so Alice will win all three rounds anyway.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
