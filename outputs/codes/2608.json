The columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$ from left to right. Therefore, each cell can be specified with the coordinates $(x,y)$, where $x$ is the column number, and $y$ is the row number (do not mix up).\n\nLet us call a rectangle with coordinates $(a,b,c,d)$ a rectangle lower left point of which has coordinates $(a,b)$, and the upper right one\u00a0\u2014 $(c,d)$.\n\nThe chessboard is painted black and white as follows:\n\n [Image] \n\n An example of a chessboard. \n\nMasha was very happy with the gift and, therefore, invited her friends Maxim and Denis to show off. The guys decided to make her a treat\u00a0\u2014 they bought her a can of white and a can of black paint, so that if the old board deteriorates, it can be repainted. When they came to Masha, something unpleasant happened: first, Maxim went over the threshold and spilled white paint on the rectangle $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)$. Then after him Denis spilled black paint on the rectangle $(x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4)$.\n\nTo spill paint of color $color$ onto a certain rectangle means that all the cells that belong to the given rectangle become $color$. The cell dyeing is superimposed on each other (if at first some cell is spilled with white paint and then with black one, then its color will be black).\n\nMasha was shocked! She drove away from the guests and decided to find out how spoiled the gift was. For this, she needs to know the number of cells of white and black color. Help her find these numbers!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach of them is described in the following format:\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n,m \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the board.\n\nThe second line contains four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$ ($1 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le m, 1 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the rectangle, the white paint was spilled on.\n\nThe third line contains four integers $x_3$, $y_3$, $x_4$, $y_4$ ($1 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le m, 1 \\le y_3 \\le y_4 \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the rectangle, the black paint was spilled on.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $t$ lines, each of which contains two numbers\u00a0\u2014 the number of white and black cells after spilling paint, respectively.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2 2\n1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n3 4\n2 2 3 2\n3 1 4 3\n1 5\n1 1 5 1\n3 1 5 1\n4 4\n1 1 4 2\n1 3 4 4\n3 4\n1 2 4 2\n2 1 3 3\n\nOutput\n0 4\n3 9\n2 3\n8 8\n4 8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nExplanation for examples:\n\nThe first picture of each illustration shows how the field looked before the dyes were spilled.
