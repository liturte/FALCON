For example, bracket sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\" and \"(\" are not.\n\nYou can change the type of some bracket $s_i$. It means that if $s_i = $ ')' then you can change it to '(' and vice versa.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of positions $i$ such that if you change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the length of the bracket sequence.\n\nThe second line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ opening '(' and closing ')' brackets.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of positions $i$ such that if you change the type of the $i$-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n(((())\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6\n()()()\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n1\n)\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n8\n)))(((((\n\nOutput\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
