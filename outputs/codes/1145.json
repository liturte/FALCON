He wants to give one badge to every of his n soldiers. Each badge has a coolness factor, which shows how much it's owner reached. Coolness factor can be increased by one for the cost of one coin. \n\nFor every pair of soldiers one of them should get a badge with strictly higher factor than the second one. Exact values of their factors aren't important, they just need to have distinct factors. \n\nColonel knows, which soldier is supposed to get which badge initially, but there is a problem. Some of badges may have the same factor of coolness. Help him and calculate how much money has to be paid for making all badges have different factors of coolness.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input consists of one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000).\n\nNext line consists of n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n), which stand for coolness factor of each badge.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput single integer \u2014 minimum amount of coins the colonel has to pay.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 3 1 4\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 2 5\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first sample test we can increase factor of first badge by 1.\n\nIn second sample test we can increase factors of the second and the third badge by 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
