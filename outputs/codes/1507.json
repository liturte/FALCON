Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nTwo integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the number of guards k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26).\n\nIn the second string, n uppercase English letters s_1s_2... s_{n} are given, where s_{i} is the entrance used by the i-th guest.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput \u00abYES\u00bb if at least one door was unguarded during some time, and \u00abNO\u00bb otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1\nAABBB\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n5 1\nABABB\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, the door A is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle. The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened.\n\nIn the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
