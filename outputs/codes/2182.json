He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $n$ of them how much effort they needed to reach red.\n\n\"Oh, I just spent $x_i$ hours solving problems\", said the $i$-th of them. \n\nBob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of minutes ($60 \\cdot x_i$), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes \u2014 for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $2$ hours, Bob could write $000120$ instead of $120$.\n\nAlice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:   rearranged its digits, or  wrote a random number. \n\nThis way, Alice generated $n$ numbers, denoted $y_1$, ..., $y_n$.\n\nFor each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $y_i$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $60$ (possibly with leading zeroes).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 418$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of grandmasters Bob asked.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains a single integer $y_i$\u00a0\u2014 the number that Alice wrote down.\n\nEach of these numbers has between $2$ and $100$ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $n$ lines.\n\nFor each $i$, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $y_i$ such that the resulting number is divisible by $60$, output \"red\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output \"cyan\".\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n603\n006\n205\n228\n1053\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nOutput\nred\nred\ncyan\ncyan\ncyan\nred\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there is one rearrangement that yields a number divisible by $60$, and that is $360$.\n\nIn the second example, there are two solutions. One is $060$ and the second is $600$.\n\nIn the third example, there are $6$ possible rearrangments: $025$, $052$, $205$, $250$, $502$, $520$. None of these numbers is divisible by $60$.\n\nIn the fourth example, there are $3$ rearrangements: $228$, $282$, $822$.\n\nIn the fifth example, none of the $24$ rearrangements result in a number divisible by $60$.\n\nIn the sixth example, note that $000\\dots0$ is a valid solution.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
