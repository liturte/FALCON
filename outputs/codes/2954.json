Anthony the Ant is a huge fan of Jimmy\u2019s music, so he can\u2019t wait to get to the concert.\n\nByteLand consists of of $N$ intersections and $M$ roads. Every road is bidirectional and connects two distinct intersections. Anthony is currently on intersection $s$ and the concert is being held at intersection $t$. Anthony must get to the concert in $T$ seconds and he can travel at $1$ meter/second.\n\nUnfortunately for Anthony, he has a huge fear of spiders and ByteLand is full of spiders. Spiders reside at certain intersections in ByteLand. Anthony will choose a path from $s$ to $t$ that maximizes $D$, the minimum distance between any intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can be travelled in no more than $T$ seconds.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $N$ ($2\\leq N\\leq 100000$), $M$ ($1\\leq M\\leq \\min (200000, n(n-1)/2)$), and $T$ ($1\\leq T\\leq 10^9$).\n\nEach of the next $M$ lines specify the roads. A road is described by three integers $u, v$ ($0\\leq u, v\\leq N-1$ and $u\\neq v$) and $d$ ($1\\leq d\\leq 10000$), which means that a $d$ meters long road connects intersections $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that at most one road connect any two intersections, and that there exists a path between any two intersections.\n\nThe next line contains $s, t$ ($0\\leq s, t\\leq N-1$ and $s\\neq t$, representing Anthony\u2019s current location and the location of the concert. You may assume Anthony can always travel from $s$ to $t$ in no more than $T$ seconds.\n\nThe last line contains a integer $1\\leq K\\leq N$, denoting the number of intersections occupied by spiders, followed by $K$ integers $0\\leq a_ i\\leq N-1$ denoting the intersections with spiders.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum $D$ (as defined earlier) for the path Anthony takes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 4 3000\n0 1 1\n1 3 1\n2 0 2018\n2 3 42\n0 3\n1 1\nSample Output:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
