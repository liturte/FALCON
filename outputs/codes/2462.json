Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.\n\nRecently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer $x$ as nearly prime if it can be represented as $p \\cdot q$, where $1 < p < q$ and $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. For example, integers $6$ and $10$ are nearly primes (since $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ and $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$), but integers $1$, $3$, $4$, $16$, $17$ or $44$ are not.\n\nCaptain Flint guessed an integer $n$ and asked you: can you represent it as the sum of $4$ different positive integers where at least $3$ of them should be nearly prime.\n\nUncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nNext $t$ lines contain test cases\u00a0\u2014 one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$\u00a0\u2014 the number Flint guessed.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print:   YES and $4$ different positive integers such that at least $3$ of them are nearly prime and their sum is equal to $n$ (if there are multiple answers print any of them);  NO if there is no way to represent $n$ as the sum of $4$ different positive integers where at least $3$ of them are nearly prime.  You can print each character of YES or NO in any case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n7\n23\n31\n36\n44\n100\n258\n\nOutput\nNO\nNO\nYES\n14 10 6 1\nYES\n5 6 10 15\nYES\n6 7 10 21\nYES\n2 10 33 55\nYES\n10 21 221 6\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first and second test cases, it can be proven that there are no four different positive integers such that at least three of them are nearly prime.\n\nIn the third test case, $n=31=2 \\cdot 7 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 1$: integers $14$, $10$, $6$ are nearly prime.\n\nIn the fourth test case, $n=36=5 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 5$: integers $6$, $10$, $15$ are nearly prime.\n\nIn the fifth test case, $n=44=2 \\cdot 3 + 7 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 7$: integers $6$, $10$, $21$ are nearly prime.\n\nIn the sixth test case, $n=100=2 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 11 + 5 \\cdot 11$: integers $10$, $33$, $55$ are nearly prime.\n\nIn the seventh test case, $n=258=2 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 7 + 13 \\cdot 17 + 2 \\cdot 3$: integers $10$, $21$, $221$, $6$ are nearly prime.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
