A sub-matrix is described by $4$ parameters\u00a0\u2014 $r_1$, $r_2$, $c_1$, and $c_2$; here, $1 \\leq r_1 \\leq r_2 \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq c_1 \\leq c_2 \\leq m$.  This sub-matrix contains all elements $a_{i,j}$ that satisfy both $r_1 \\leq i \\leq r_2$ and $c_1 \\leq j \\leq c_2$.  A sub-matrix is, further, called an even length square if $r_2-r_1 = c_2-c_1$ and $r_2-r_1+1$ is divisible by $2$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
