The index of the $i$-th student is $p_i$. It is guaranteed that all indices of students are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ (i. e. they form a permutation).\n\nStudents want to start a round dance. A clockwise round dance can be started if the student $2$ comes right after the student $1$ in clockwise order (there are no students between them), the student $3$ comes right after the student $2$ in clockwise order, and so on, and the student $n$ comes right after the student $n - 1$ in clockwise order. A counterclockwise round dance is almost the same thing \u2014 the only difference is that the student $i$ should be right after the student $i - 1$ in counterclockwise order (this condition should be met for every $i$ from $2$ to $n$). \n\nFor example, if the indices of students listed in clockwise order are $[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$, then they can start a clockwise round dance. If the students have indices $[3, 2, 1, 4]$ in clockwise order, then they can start a counterclockwise round dance.\n\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to start a round dance. Note that the students cannot change their positions before starting the dance; they cannot swap or leave the circle, and no other student can enter the circle. \n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.\n\nThe first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe second line of the query contains a permutation of indices $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$), where $p_i$ is the index of the $i$-th student (in clockwise order). It is guaranteed that all $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ (i. e. they form a permutation).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query, print the answer on it. If a round dance can be started with the given order of students, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n1 3 2\n5\n1 2 3 5 4\n1\n1\n5\n3 2 1 5 4\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
