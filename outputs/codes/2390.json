The outer circumference of the counter is C meters. Customers cannot go inside the counter.\nNakahashi entered Teishi-zushi, and he was guided to the counter. Now, there are N pieces of sushi (vinegared rice with seafood and so on) on the counter. The distance measured clockwise from the point where Nakahashi is standing to the point where the i-th sushi is placed, is x_i meters. Also, the i-th sushi has a nutritive value of v_i kilocalories.\nNakahashi can freely walk around the circumference of the counter. When he reach a point where a sushi is placed, he can eat that sushi and take in its nutrition (naturally, the sushi disappears). However, while walking, he consumes 1 kilocalories per meter.\nWhenever he is satisfied, he can leave the restaurant from any place (he does not have to return to the initial place). On balance, at most how much nutrition can he take in before he leaves? That is, what is the maximum possible value of the total nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed? Assume that there are no other customers, and no new sushi will be added to the counter. Also, since Nakahashi has plenty of nutrition in his body, assume that no matter how much he walks and consumes energy, he never dies from hunger.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n - 2 \u2264 C \u2264 10^{14}\n - 1 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N < C\n - 1 \u2264 v_i \u2264 10^9\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Subscores-----\n - 300 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying N \u2264 100.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN C\nx_1 v_1\nx_2 v_2\n:\nx_N v_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Nakahashi can take in at most c kilocalories on balance before he leaves the restaurant, print c.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 20\n2 80\n9 120\n16 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n191\n\nThere are three sushi on the counter with a circumference of 20 meters. If he walks two meters clockwise from the initial place, he can eat a sushi of 80 kilocalories. If he walks seven more meters clockwise, he can eat a sushi of 120 kilocalories. If he leaves now, the total nutrition taken in is 200 kilocalories, and the total energy consumed is 9 kilocalories, thus he can take in 191 kilocalories on balance, which is the largest possible value.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
