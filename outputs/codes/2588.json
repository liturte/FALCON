Let's consider the road (for simplicity) as a segment $[0, n]$ on $OX$ axis. The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we'll denote each crossroad as an interval $(x, x + 1)$ with integer $x$. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of $n$ characters, where character 0 means that current interval doesn't contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad.\n\nUsually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of $1$ unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for $[0, n]$ road, we must install $n + 1$ pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height $2$, so the pipeline won't obstruct the way for cars.\n\nWe can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment $[x, x + 1]$ with integer $x$ consisting of three parts: $0.5$ units of horizontal pipe + $1$ unit of vertical pipe + $0.5$ of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height $2$, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to $2$ units.\n\n [Image] \n\nEach unit of gas pipeline costs us $a$ bourles, and each unit of pillar \u2014 $b$ bourles. So, it's not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height $2$. Find the shape of the pipeline with minimum possible cost and calculate that cost.\n\nNote that you must start and finish the pipeline on height $1$ and, also, it's guaranteed that the first and last characters of the input string are equal to 0.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe fist line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of queries. Next $2 \\cdot T$ lines contain independent queries \u2014 one query per two lines.\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $a$, $b$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le a \\le 10^8$, $1 \\le b \\le 10^8$) \u2014 the length of the road, the cost of one unit of the pipeline and the cost of one unit of the pillar, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, $s_1 = s_n = 0$) \u2014 the description of the road.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total length of all strings $s$ doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ integers \u2014 one per query. For each query print the minimum possible cost of the constructed pipeline.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n8 2 5\n00110010\n8 1 1\n00110010\n9 100000000 100000000\n010101010\n2 5 1\n00\n\nOutput\n94\n25\n2900000000\n13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe optimal pipeline for the first query is shown at the picture above.\n\nThe optimal pipeline for the second query is pictured below:\n\n [Image] \n\nThe optimal (and the only possible) pipeline for the third query is shown below:\n\n [Image] \n\nThe optimal pipeline for the fourth query is shown below:\n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
