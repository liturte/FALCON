Help Mirko by reconstructing the equation from the three integers\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains three integers less than 100, separated by spaces. The input data will guarantee that a solution, although not necessarily unique, will always exist.\n\n-----Output-----\nOn a single line, output a valid equation containing the three integers (in the same order), an equals sign and one of the four operations. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 3 8\nSample Output:\n5+3=8\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
