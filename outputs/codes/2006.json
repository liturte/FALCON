Today, she came up with the new game \"Candy Matrix 2: Reload\".\n\nThe field for the new game is a rectangle table of size n \u00d7 m. Each line of the table contains one cell with a dwarf figurine, one cell with a candy, the other cells of the line are empty. The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout \"Let's go!\". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell. The movement continues until one of the following events occurs:\n\n  some dwarf in one of the chosen lines is located in the rightmost cell of his row;  some dwarf in the chosen lines is located in the cell with the candy. \n\nThe point of the game is to transport all the dwarves to the candy cells.\n\nInna is fabulous, as she came up with such an interesting game. But what about you? Your task is to play this game optimally well. Specifically, you should say by the given game field what minimum number of moves the player needs to reach the goal of the game.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000;\u00a02 \u2264 m \u2264 1000). \n\nNext n lines each contain m characters \u2014 the game field for the \"Candy Martix 2: Reload\". Character \"*\" represents an empty cell of the field, character \"G\" represents a dwarf and character \"S\" represents a candy. The matrix doesn't contain other characters. It is guaranteed that each line contains exactly one character \"G\" and one character \"S\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 either the minimum number of moves needed to achieve the aim of the game, or -1, if the aim cannot be achieved on the given game field.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n*G*S\nG**S\n*G*S\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 3\nS*G\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
