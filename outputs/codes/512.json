Each person i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) got on at Floor A_i and off at Floor B_i. Here, 1 \\leq A_i < B_i \\leq 2N, and just one person got on or off at each floor.\nAdditionally, because of their difficult personalities, the following condition was satisfied:\n - Let C_i (= B_i - A_i - 1) be the number of times, while Person i were on the elevator, other persons got on or off. Then, the following holds:\n - If there was a moment when both Person i and Person j were on the elevator, C_i = C_j.\nWe recorded the sequences A and B, but unfortunately, we have lost some of the records. If the record of A_i or B_i is lost, it will be given to you as -1.\nAdditionally, the remaining records may be incorrect.\nDetermine whether there is a pair of A and B that is consistent with the remaining records.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - A_i = -1 or 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 2N.\n - B_i = -1 or 1 \\leq B_i \\leq 2N.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n:\nA_N B_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is a pair of A and B that is consistent with the remaining records, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n1 -1\n-1 4\n-1 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nFor example, if B_1 = 3, A_2 = 2, and A_3 = 5, all the requirements are met.\nIn this case, there is a moment when both Person 1 and Person 2 were on the elevator, which is fine since C_1 = C_2 = 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
