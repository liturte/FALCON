We know that a one ride subway ticket costs a rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special ticket for m rides (she can buy it several times). It costs b rubles. Ann did the math; she will need to use subway n times. Help Ann, tell her what is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make n rides?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains four space-separated integers n, m, a, b (1 \u2264 n, m, a, b \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the m ride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an m ride ticket. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to spend.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n5 2 2 3\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride ticket. There are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three m ride tickets.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
