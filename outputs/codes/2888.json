Ash has planned his route\nfor the journey so that it passes through N cities, numbered 1, 2, \u2026, N, and in this order.\n\nWhen they set out, Pikachu has an initial strength of Sin as well as an experience\nvalue (XV) of 0. As they travel they may increase his strength and experience value\nin a manner to be described below.\n\nIn each city,  Ash can choose either to train Pikachu or let Pikachu battle the\nGym-leader (but not both).  The Gym-leader in ith city has experience E[i]. If\nPikachu enters a city i with strength S and decides to train, then this\nincreases his strength by the cube of the sum of the digits in his current\nstrength. For example, if he entered a city with a strength of 12, then\ntraining will increase his strength to 12 + (1+2)3 = 39.  On the other hand,\nif he enters city i with strength S and battles the Gym-leader, then this\nincreases his experience value XV by S*E[i].\n\nAsh wants your help to find out the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain \nat the end of his journey.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains two space separated integers, N and Sin, which are the number of cities, and the initial strength, respectively.\n\n- The second line contains N space separated integers, which correspond to E[1], E[2],..., E[N].\n\n-----Output-----\n- A single integer which is the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain.\n\n-----Constraints-----\nFor all test cases you may assume that: \n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000\n- 0 \u2264 Sin \u2264 109\n- 0 \u2264 E[i] \u2264 104\n\nSubtask 1: For 10% of the score,\n\n- N \u2264 20 and Sin = 1\n\nSubtask 2: For further 40% of the score,\n\n- E[i] = k for all i\ni.e. E[i] is some constant k, for all i\n\nSubtask 3: For further 50% of the score,\n\n- \nNo further constraints.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput 1:\n2 12\n5 10\n\nOutput 1:\n390\n\n-----Explanation 1-----\nSuppose Pikachu trains in the first city, his strength will increase to 39, because as explained above, 12 + (1+2)3 = 39. If he battles in the first city, his XV will increase by (12*5) = 60.\n\nIf Pikachu trains in the first city, and then battles in the second city, his XV will increase by 39*10 = 390. So, the final XV will be 0+390 = 390. You can check that you cannot do better than this. Hence the answer is 390.\n\nInput 2:\n4 1\n100 1 6 2\n\nOutput 2:\n120\n\n-----Explanation 2-----\nPikachu battles in the first city, trains in the second and third, and then battles in the fourth city. So his strength going into each of the four cities is (1, 1, 2, 10). And so he gains 1*100 XV from the first city and 10*2 XV from the fourth city. This gets him a total of 120 XV, and you can verify that nothing better can be done.\n\nNote:\nYou may download the problem statements PDF and test cases zipped files here: http://pd.codechef.com/com/inoi/problems.zip.
