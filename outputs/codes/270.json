The rooms are numbered 1 through N.\nTakahashi is now in Room 1, and Room N has the exit. The i-th passage connects Room s_i and Room t_i (s_i < t_i) and can only be traversed in the direction from Room s_i to Room t_i. It is known that, for each room except Room N, there is at least one passage going from that room.\nTakahashi will escape from the cave. Each time he reaches a room (assume that he has reached Room 1 at the beginning), he will choose a passage uniformly at random from the ones going from that room and take that passage.\nAoki, a friend of Takahashi's, can block one of the passages (or do nothing) before Takahashi leaves Room 1. However, it is not allowed to block a passage so that Takahashi is potentially unable to reach Room N.\nLet E be the expected number of passages Takahashi takes before he reaches Room N. Find the value of E when Aoki makes a choice that minimizes E.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 600\n - N-1 \\leq M \\leq \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\n - s_i < t_i\n - If i != j, (s_i, t_i) \\neq (s_j, t_j).
