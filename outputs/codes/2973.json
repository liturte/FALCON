Recently, the needle on the speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she might have placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads $s$, her true speed is $s+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant (possibly negative). \n\nSheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to use this to compute $c$. The journey consisted of $n$ segments. In the $i^{\\text {th}}$ segment she traveled a distance of $d_ i$ and the speedometer read $s_ i$ for the entire segment. This whole journey took time $t$. Help Sheila by computing $c$.\n\nNote that while Sheila\u2019s speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$), the number of sections in Sheila\u2019s journey, and $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^6$), the total time. This is followed by $n$ lines, each describing one segment of Sheila\u2019s journey. The $i^{\\text {th}}$ of these lines contains two integers $d_ i$ ($1 \\le d_ i \\le 1000$) and $s_ i$ ($|s_ i| \\le 1000$), the distance and speedometer reading for the $i^{\\text {th}}$ segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the constant $c$ in miles per hour. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 5\n4 -1\n4 0\n10 3\nSample Output:\n3.000000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
