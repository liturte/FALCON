After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.\n\nIf a solution exists, you should print it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"NO\" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. \n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3454\n\nOutput\nYES\n344\n\nInput\n10\n\nOutput\nYES\n0\n\nInput\n111111\n\nOutput\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
