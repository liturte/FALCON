You were tasked with SIS logistics, so you really care about travel time between different locations: it is important to know how long it would take to get from the lecture room to the canteen, or from the gym to the server room.\n\nThe building consists of n towers, h floors each, where the towers are labeled from 1 to n, the floors are labeled from 1 to h. There is a passage between any two adjacent towers (two towers i and i + 1 for all i: 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) on every floor x, where a \u2264 x \u2264 b. It takes exactly one minute to walk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two adjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not permitted to leave the building.\n\n [Image]\n\nThe picture illustrates the first example. \n\nYou have given k pairs of locations (t_{a}, f_{a}), (t_{b}, f_{b}): floor f_{a} of tower t_{a} and floor f_{b} of tower t_{b}. For each pair you need to determine the minimum walking time between these locations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains following integers:\n\n  n: the number of towers in the building (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^8),  h: the number of floors in each tower (1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^8),  a and b: the lowest and highest floor where it's possible to move between adjacent towers (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 h),  k: total number of queries (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^4). \n\nNext k lines contain description of the queries. Each description consists of four integers t_{a}, f_{a}, t_{b}, f_{b} (1 \u2264 t_{a}, t_{b} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 f_{a}, f_{b} \u2264 h). This corresponds to a query to find the minimum travel time between f_{a}-th floor of the t_{a}-th tower and f_{b}-th floor of the t_{b}-th tower.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query print a single integer: the minimum walking time between the locations in minutes.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3 6 2 3 3\n1 2 1 3\n1 4 3 4\n1 2 2 3\n\nOutput\n1\n4\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
