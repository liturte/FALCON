Therefore he decided to solve some crosswords. It's well known that it is a very interesting occupation though it can be very difficult from time to time. In the course of solving one of the crosswords, Leha had to solve a simple task. You are able to do it too, aren't you?\n\nLeha has two strings s and t. The hacker wants to change the string s at such way, that it can be found in t as a substring. All the changes should be the following: Leha chooses one position in the string s and replaces the symbol in this position with the question mark \"?\". The hacker is sure that the question mark in comparison can play the role of an arbitrary symbol. For example, if he gets string s=\"ab?b\" as a result, it will appear in t=\"aabrbb\" as a substring.\n\nGuaranteed that the length of the string s doesn't exceed the length of the string t. Help the hacker to replace in s as few symbols as possible so that the result of the replacements can be found in t as a substring. The symbol \"?\" should be considered equal to any other symbol.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the length of the string s and the length of the string t correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains n lowercase English letters \u2014 string s.\n\nThe third line contains m lowercase English letters \u2014 string t.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print single integer k \u2014 the minimal number of symbols that need to be replaced.\n\nIn the second line print k distinct integers denoting the positions of symbols in the string s which need to be replaced. Print the positions in any order. If there are several solutions print any of them. The numbering of the positions begins from one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\nabc\nxaybz\n\nOutput\n2\n2 3 \n\nInput\n4 10\nabcd\nebceabazcd\n\nOutput\n1\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
