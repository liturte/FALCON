In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.\n\nThere is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.\n\nCuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, $[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]$ $\\to$ two cuts $\\to$ $[4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5]$. On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.\n\nThe cost of the cut between $x$ and $y$ numbers is $|x - y|$ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) and an integer $B$ ($1 \\le B \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the sequence and the number of bitcoins you have.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ integers: $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the sequence, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible number of cuts which can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 4\n1 2 5 10 15 20\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 10\n1 3 2 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n6 100\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the optimal answer is to split sequence between $2$ and $5$. Price of this cut is equal to $3$ bitcoins.\n\nIn the second sample it is not possible to make even one cut even with unlimited number of bitcoins.\n\nIn the third sample the sequence should be cut between $2$ and $3$, and between $4$ and $5$. The total price of the cuts is $1 + 1 = 2$ bitcoins.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
