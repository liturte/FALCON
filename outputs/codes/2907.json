Messages at this station are encoded with a rotation (\u201cCaesar\u201d) cipher that replaces each letter with one at a set offset in the alphabet, e.g., for offset $2$ an \u2018a\u2019 is replaced by a \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 is replaced by \u2018a\u2019. In order to encode a message, this cipher may be applied more than once. Each such application counts as a step in the encoding process. Boris teaches the new employees to encode messages by demonstrating each step of the encoding individually. However, Boris does not does not like seeing messages that contain at least half as many vowels as consonants after applying an encoding step. (Boris considers \u2018a\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 as vowels.) He grows annoyed and more and more unhappy with each step where this situation occurs.\n\nYour job is to encode a given message and determine whether Boris will see fewer steps that annoy him than ones that don\u2019t. Since Boris wants to be happy in his job he will give a message that annoys him too much to a colleague.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $O$ ($1 \\le O \\le 25$) that represent the offset used for the rotation cipher. The second line contains the message to encode, which consists entirely of lowercase English characters. The length of the message is between $1$ and $80$ characters. The third line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 26$), the number of times the cipher must be applied.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u2018Boris\u2019 if strictly more steps sound good than bad, and \u2018Colleague\u2019 otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nthequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog\n10\nSample Output:\nBoris\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
