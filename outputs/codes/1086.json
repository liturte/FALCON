Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.\nThe square (i, j) has two numbers A_{ij} and B_{ij} written on it.\nFirst, for each square, Takahashi paints one of the written numbers red and the other blue.\nThen, he travels from the square (1, 1) to the square (H, W). In one move, he can move from a square (i, j) to the square (i+1, j) or the square (i, j+1). He must not leave the grid.\nLet the unbalancedness be the absolute difference of the sum of red numbers and the sum of blue numbers written on the squares along Takahashi's path, including the squares (1, 1) and (H, W).\nTakahashi wants to make the unbalancedness as small as possible by appropriately painting the grid and traveling on it.\nFind the minimum unbalancedness possible.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq H \\leq 80\n - 2 \\leq W \\leq 80\n - 0 \\leq A_{ij} \\leq 80\n - 0 \\leq B_{ij} \\leq 80\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nA_{11} A_{12} \\ldots A_{1W}\n:\nA_{H1} A_{H2} \\ldots A_{HW}\nB_{11} B_{12} \\ldots B_{1W}\n:\nB_{H1} B_{H2} \\ldots B_{HW}\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum unbalancedness possible.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n1 2\n3 4\n3 4\n2 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n0\n\nBy painting the grid and traveling on it as shown in the figure below, the sum of red numbers and the sum of blue numbers are 3+3+1=7 and 1+2+4=7, respectively, for the unbalancedness of 0.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
