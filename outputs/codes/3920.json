The boy found out that all the angles of the hexagon are equal to $120^{\\circ}$. Then he measured the length of its sides, and found that each of them is equal to an integer number of centimeters. There the properties of the hexagon ended and Gerald decided to draw on it.\n\nHe painted a few lines, parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The lines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Now Gerald wonders how many triangles he has got. But there were so many of them that Gerald lost the track of his counting. Help the boy count the triangles.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line of the input contains 6 space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 and a_6 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000) \u2014 the lengths of the sides of the hexagons in centimeters in the clockwise order. It is guaranteed that the hexagon with the indicated properties and the exactly such sides exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of triangles with the sides of one 1 centimeter, into which the hexagon is split.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThis is what Gerald's hexagon looks like in the first sample:\n\n$\\theta$\n\nAnd that's what it looks like in the second sample:\n\n$A$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
