They are equally skilled but they won't solve problems in the same order.\n\nThere will be n problems. The i-th problem has initial score p_{i} and it takes exactly t_{i} minutes to solve it. Problems are sorted by difficulty\u00a0\u2014 it's guaranteed that p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 and t_{i} < t_{i} + 1.\n\nA constant c is given too, representing the speed of loosing points. Then, submitting the i-th problem at time x (x minutes after the start of the contest) gives max(0,  p_{i} - c\u00b7x) points.\n\nLimak is going to solve problems in order 1, 2, ..., n (sorted increasingly by p_{i}). Radewoosh is going to solve them in order n, n - 1, ..., 1 (sorted decreasingly by p_{i}). Your task is to predict the outcome\u00a0\u2014 print the name of the winner (person who gets more points at the end) or a word \"Tie\" in case of a tie.\n\nYou may assume that the duration of the competition is greater or equal than the sum of all t_{i}. That means both Limak and Radewoosh will accept all n problems.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and c (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems and the constant representing the speed of loosing points.\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 1000, p_{i} < p_{i} + 1)\u00a0\u2014 initial scores.\n\nThe third line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 1000, t_{i} < t_{i} + 1) where t_{i} denotes the number of minutes one needs to solve the i-th problem.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Limak\" (without quotes) if Limak will get more points in total. Print \"Radewoosh\" (without quotes) if Radewoosh will get more points in total. Print \"Tie\" (without quotes) if Limak and Radewoosh will get the same total number of points.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n50 85 250\n10 15 25\n\nOutput\nLimak\n\nInput\n3 6\n50 85 250\n10 15 25\n\nOutput\nRadewoosh\n\nInput\n8 1\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n8 10 58 63 71 72 75 76\n\nOutput\nTie\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, there are 3 problems. Limak solves them as follows:\n\n  Limak spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem and he gets 50 - c\u00b710 = 50 - 2\u00b710 = 30 points.  Limak spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 10 + 15 = 25 minutes after the start of the contest. For the 2-nd problem he gets 85 - 2\u00b725 = 35 points.  He spends 25 minutes on the 3-rd problem so he submits it 10 + 15 + 25 = 50 minutes after the start. For this problem he gets 250 - 2\u00b750 = 150 points. \n\nSo, Limak got 30 + 35 + 150 = 215 points.\n\nRadewoosh solves problem in the reversed order:\n\n  Radewoosh solves 3-rd problem after 25 minutes so he gets 250 - 2\u00b725 = 200 points.  He spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 25 + 15 = 40 minutes after the start. He gets 85 - 2\u00b740 = 5 points for this problem.  He spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem so he submits it 25 + 15 + 10 = 50 minutes after the start. He gets max(0, 50 - 2\u00b750) = max(0,  - 50) = 0 points. \n\nRadewoosh got 200 + 5 + 0 = 205 points in total. Limak has 215 points so Limak wins.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak will get 0 points for each problem and Radewoosh will first solve the hardest problem and he will get 250 - 6\u00b725 = 100 points for that. Radewoosh will get 0 points for other two problems but he is the winner anyway.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak will get 2 points for the 1-st problem and 2 points for the 2-nd problem. Radewoosh will get 4 points for the 8-th problem. They won't get points for other problems and thus there is a tie because 2 + 2 = 4.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
