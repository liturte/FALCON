Two large food chains have recently reached an agreement on market sharing. In the middle of each road, exactly one chain will be given rights to build a restaurant.\n\nTo ensure the market is shared fairly, each city must have at least one restaurant from each chain on the roads connected to that city. However, there are cities with only one road, or no roads at all, and for those cities the above requirement does not apply. Such cities are doomed to visit one chain, or travel a bit further.\n\nWrite a program that will determine for each road the chain that should build there so that these requirements are met.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $E$ ($1 \\le N, E \\le 100000$), number of cities and number of roads.\n\nThe next $E$ lines contain two integers each. Each line describes one road. Integers $A_ i$ and $B_ i$ ($1 \\le A_ i , B_ i \\le N$; $A_ i \\ne B_ i$) denote a road connecting cities $A i$ and $B_ i$.\n\nThere will never be two or more roads connecting the same pair of cities.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is no way to fairly assign the roads, the first and only line of input should contain \u201c0\u201d.\n\nOtherwise output exactly $E$ lines, one for each road, in the same order as they were given in the input. The $i^\\text {th}$ line should contain \u201c1\u201d if the first chain has the right to build on this road, or \u201c2\u201d if the second one does.\n\nNote: if the solution is not unique, you may output any valid solution.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 4\n1 4\n4 5\nSample Output 1:\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n7 4\nSample Output 2:\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
