These cities are connected by $m$ bi-directional roads such that there exists a path between every pair of cities. There may be multiple roads between two cities. Each road has a positive length.\n\nMagical crystals are the most important resources transported between the cities in the Magical Island. The cost of sending one magical crystal from city $s$ to city $t$ equals the smallest distance of any path between city $s$ and city $t$. The distance of a path in the Magical Island is a bit special though: It is the bitwise OR value of all the road lengths on this path.\n\nIn each of the next $q$ days, exactly one magical crystal will be transported between a pair of cities. Help the Magical Island figure out the transportation cost for each day.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$ ($2\\leq n\\leq 10^5,1\\leq m\\leq n+200$). Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $a, b, w$ that describe a road connecting city $a$ and city $b$ with length $w$ ($1\\leq a, b\\leq n, a \\neq b, 1\\leq w \\leq 10^9$). In the next line, there is a single integer $q$ $(1\\leq q\\leq 10000)$, the number of days to consider. The next $q$ lines each have two integers $s$ and $t$ ($1\\leq s, t\\leq n, s \\neq t$). The $i$th line indicates that on day $i$ a crystal is sent from city $s$ to city $t$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each of the $q$ days, output the cost of sending the crystal from $s$ to $t$ for that day.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 7\n1 2 1\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n1 4 1\n2 3 4\n2 4 4\n3 4 4\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\nSample Output:\n1\n2\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
