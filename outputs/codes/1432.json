N is an odd number.\nBetween these mountains, there are N dams, called Dam 1, Dam 2, ..., Dam N. Dam i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) is located between Mountain i and i+1 (Mountain N+1 is Mountain 1).\nWhen Mountain i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) receives 2x liters of rain, Dam i-1 and Dam i each accumulates x liters of water (Dam 0 is Dam N).\nOne day, each of the mountains received a non-negative even number of liters of rain.\nAs a result, Dam i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) accumulated a total of A_i liters of water.\nFind the amount of rain each of the mountains received. We can prove that the solution is unique under the constraints of this problem.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 3 \\leq N \\leq 10^5-1\n - N is an odd number.\n - 0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\n - The situation represented by input can occur when each of the mountains receives a non-negative even number of liters of rain.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 ...
