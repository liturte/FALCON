Compare those two numbers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10, 2 \u2264 b_{x} \u2264 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. \n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 \u2264 x_{i} < b_{x}) \u2014 the digits of X.

We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
