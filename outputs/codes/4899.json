This app has some stricter social rules than previous iterations. For example, if someone says goodbye using Later!, the other person is expected to reply with Alligator!. You can not keep track of all these social conventions and decide to automate any necessary responses, starting with the most important one: the greetings. When your conversational partner opens with he\u2026ey, you have to respond with hee\u2026eey as well, but using twice as many e\u2019s!\n\nGiven a string of the form he\u2026ey of length at most $1000$, print the greeting you will respond with, containing twice as many e\u2019s.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The input consists of one line containing a single string $s$ as specified, of length at least $3$ and at most $1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the required response.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nhey\nSample Output:\nheey\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
