That's exactly what we are looking for.Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on Saturday\n\nReading the book \"Equations of Mathematical Magic\" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: $a - (a \\oplus x) - x = 0$ for some given $a$, where $\\oplus$ stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some $x$, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains several possible values of $a$ and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of these values.\n\nThe following $t$ lines contain the values of parameter $a$, each value is an integer from $0$ to $2^{30} - 1$ inclusive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each value of $a$ print exactly one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of $a$ appear in the input.\n\nOne can show that the number of solutions is always finite.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n0\n2\n1073741823\n\nOutput\n1\n2\n1073741824\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's define the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers $x$ and $y$, consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes): $x_k \\dots x_2 x_1 x_0$ and $y_k \\dots y_2 y_1 y_0$. Here, $x_i$ is the $i$-th bit of the number $x$ and $y_i$ is the $i$-th bit of the number $y$. Let $r = x \\oplus y$ be the result of the XOR operation of $x$ and $y$. Then $r$ is defined as $r_k \\dots r_2 r_1 r_0$ where:\n\n$$ r_i = \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} 1, ~ \\text{if} ~ x_i \\ne y_i \\\\ 0, ~ \\text{if} ~ x_i = y_i \\end{aligned} \\right. $$\n\nFor the first value of the parameter, only $x = 0$ is a solution of the equation.\n\nFor the second value of the parameter, solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
