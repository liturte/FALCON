The warehouse can be represented as a coordinate grid. Initially, the robot stays at the point $(0, 0)$. The $i$-th package is at the point $(x_i, y_i)$. It is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point $(0, 0)$ doesn't contain a package.\n\nThe robot is semi-broken and only can move up ('U') and right ('R'). In other words, in one move the robot can go from the point $(x, y)$ to the point ($x + 1, y$) or to the point $(x, y + 1)$.\n\nAs we say above, the robot wants to collect all $n$ packages (in arbitrary order). He wants to do it with the minimum possible number of moves. If there are several possible traversals, the robot wants to choose the lexicographically smallest path.\n\nThe string $s$ of length $n$ is lexicographically less than the string $t$ of length $n$ if there is some index $1 \\le j \\le n$ that for all $i$ from $1$ to $j-1$ $s_i = t_i$ and $s_j < t_j$. It is the standard comparison of string, like in a dictionary. Most programming languages compare strings in this way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of packages.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain descriptions of packages. The $i$-th package is given as two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the $x$-coordinate of the package and the $y$-coordinate of the package.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point $(0, 0)$ doesn't contain a package.\n\nThe sum of all values $n$ over test cases in the test doesn't exceed $1000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the answer for each test case.\n\nIf it is impossible to collect all $n$ packages in some order starting from ($0,0$), print \"NO\" on the first line.\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line. Then print the shortest path \u2014 a string consisting of characters 'R' and 'U'. Among all such paths choose the lexicographically smallest path.\n\nNote that in this problem \"YES\" and \"NO\" can be only uppercase words, i.e. \"Yes\", \"no\" and \"YeS\" are not acceptable.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5\n1 3\n1 2\n3 3\n5 5\n4 3\n2\n1 0\n0 1\n1\n4 3\n\nOutput\nYES\nRUUURRRRUU\nNO\nYES\nRRRRUUU\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case in the example the optimal path RUUURRRRUU is shown below:  [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
