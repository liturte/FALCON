The task was very simple - given an arithmetic expression, return the result of evaluating this expression. However, looks like there is a bug in the reference solution...\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nReproduce the output of the reference solution, including the bug.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8-7+6-5+4-3+2-1-0\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n2+2\n\nOutput\n-46\n\nInput\n112-37\n\nOutput\n375\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
