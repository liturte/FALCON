Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.\n\nIn total, Nastya dropped $n$ grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from $a - b$ to $a + b$, inclusive (numbers $a$ and $b$ are known), and the whole package of $n$ grains weighs from $c - d$ to $c + d$ grams, inclusive (numbers $c$ and $d$ are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all $n$ grains in it.\n\nHelp Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the $i$-th grain weighs some integer number $x_i$ $(a - b \\leq x_i \\leq a + b)$, and in total they weigh from $c - d$ to $c + d$, inclusive ($c - d \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \\leq c + d$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 1000)$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. \n\nThe next $t$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases, each line contains $5$ integers: $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 1000)$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of grains that Nastya counted and $a, b, c, d$ $(0 \\leq b < a \\leq 1000, 0 \\leq d < c \\leq 1000)$ \u00a0\u2014 numbers that determine the possible weight of one grain of rice (from $a - b$ to $a + b$) and the possible total weight of the package (from $c - d$ to $c + d$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case given in the input print \"Yes\", if the information about the weights is not inconsistent, and print \"No\" if $n$ grains with masses from $a - b$ to $a + b$ cannot make a package with a total mass from $c - d$ to $c + d$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n7 20 3 101 18\n11 11 10 234 2\n8 9 7 250 122\n19 41 21 321 10\n3 10 8 6 1\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, we can assume that each grain weighs $17$ grams, and a pack $119$ grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, we can assume that each grain weighs $16$ grams, and a pack $128$ grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the fifth test case of the example, we can be assumed that $3$ grains of rice weigh $2$, $2$, and $3$ grams, and a pack is $7$ grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the second and fourth test cases of the example, we can prove that it is impossible to determine the correct weight of all grains of rice and the weight of the pack so that the weight of the pack is equal to the total weight of all collected grains.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
