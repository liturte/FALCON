In the first query, the sequence $5, 6, 13, 26$ is valid since $6 = 5 + \\bf{\\color{blue} 1}$, $13 = 6 + 5 + {\\bf\\color{blue} 2}$ and $26 = 13 + 6 + 5 + {\\bf\\color{blue} 2}$ have the bold values all between $1$ and $2$, so the sequence is $2$-cute. Other valid sequences, such as $5, 7, 13, 26$ are also accepted.\n\nIn the second query, the only possible $1$-cute sequence starting at $3$ is $3, 4, 8, 16, \\dots$, which does not contain $9$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
