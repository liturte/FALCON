It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.\n\nYour task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible. Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \\le m \\le min(2 \\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges, respectively.\n\nThe following $m$ lines denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$, $u_i \\ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \\ne u_i$ is satisfied.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n-1$ lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge $(v, u)$ is considered the same as the edge $(u, v)$).\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 5\n4 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\n3 5\n2 1\n3 2\n3 4\n\nInput\n4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n\nOutput\n4 1\n1 2\n1 3\n\nInput\n8 9\n1 2\n2 3\n2 5\n1 6\n3 4\n6 5\n4 5\n2 7\n5 8\n\nOutput\n3 2\n2 5\n8 5\n6 1\n2 7\n1 2\n3 4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nPicture corresponding to the first example: [Image]\n\nIn this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $3$ is $3$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer.\n\nPicture corresponding to the second example: [Image]\n\nIn this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $1$ is $3$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer.\n\nPicture corresponding to the third example: [Image]\n\nIn this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex $2$ is $4$. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer. But because this example is symmetric, we can choose almost the same spanning tree but with vertex $5$ instead of $2$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
