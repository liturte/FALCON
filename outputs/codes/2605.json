After thinking about where to travel this time, she chose XXX\u00a0\u2014 beautiful, but little-known northern country.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about XXX:  XXX consists of n cities, k of whose (just imagine!) are capital cities.  All of cities in the country are beautiful, but each is beautiful in its own way. Beauty value of i-th city equals to c_{i}.  All the cities are consecutively connected by the roads, including 1-st and n-th city, forming a cyclic route 1 \u2014 2 \u2014 ... \u2014 n \u2014 1. Formally, for every 1 \u2264 i < n there is a road between i-th and i + 1-th city, and another one between 1-st and n-th city.  Each capital city is connected with each other city directly by the roads. Formally, if city x is a capital city, then for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,  i \u2260 x, there is a road between cities x and i.  There is at most one road between any two cities.  Price of passing a road directly depends on beauty values of cities it connects. Thus if there is a road between cities i and j, price of passing it equals c_{i}\u00b7c_{j}.\n\nMishka started to gather her things for a trip, but didn't still decide which route to follow and thus she asked you to help her determine summary price of passing each of the roads in XXX. Formally, for every pair of cities a and b (a < b), such that there is a road between a and b you are to find sum of products c_{a}\u00b7c_{b}. Will you help her?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities in XXX and the number of capital cities among them.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 beauty values of the cities.\n\nThe third line of the input contains k distinct integers id_1, id_2, ..., id_{k} (1 \u2264 id_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 indices of capital cities. Indices are given in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer\u00a0\u2014 summary price of passing each of the roads in XXX.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 1\n2 3 1 2\n3\n\nOutput\n17\nInput\n5 2\n3 5 2 2 4\n1 4\n\nOutput\n71\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThis image describes first sample case:\n\n[Image]\n\nIt is easy to see that summary price is equal to 17.\n\nThis image describes second sample case:\n\n[Image]\n\nIt is easy to see that summary price is equal to 71.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
