Or may be the story was more complicated?\n\nThere are $n$ students living in a building, and for each of them the favorite drink $a_i$ is known. So you know $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le k$) is the type of the favorite drink of the $i$-th student. The drink types are numbered from $1$ to $k$.\n\nThere are infinite number of drink sets. Each set consists of exactly two portions of the same drink. In other words, there are $k$ types of drink sets, the $j$-th type contains two portions of the drink $j$. The available number of sets of each of the $k$ types is infinite.\n\nYou know that students will receive the minimum possible number of sets to give all students exactly one drink. Obviously, the number of sets will be exactly $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$, where $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is $x$ rounded up.\n\nAfter students receive the sets, they will distribute their portions by their choice: each student will get exactly one portion. Note, that if $n$ is odd then one portion will remain unused and the students' teacher will drink it.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of students that can get their favorite drink if $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ sets will be chosen optimally and students will distribute portions between themselves optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 1\\,000$) \u2014 the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain student's favorite drinks. The $i$-th line contains a single integer from $1$ to $k$ \u2014 the type of the favorite drink of the $i$-th student.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint exactly one integer \u2014 the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n10 3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n3\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, students could choose three sets with drinks $1$, $1$ and $2$ (so they will have two sets with two drinks of the type $1$ each and one set with two drinks of the type $2$, so portions will be $1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2$). This way all students except the second one will get their favorite drinks.\n\nAnother possible answer is sets with drinks $1$, $2$ and $3$. In this case the portions will be $1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3$. Then all the students except one will gain their favorite drinks. The only student that will not gain the favorite drink will be a student with $a_i = 1$ (i.e. the first, the third or the fourth).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
