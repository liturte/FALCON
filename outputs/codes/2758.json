The cat genetics experts among the readers will note that we are ignoring a wide range of genes, e.g., Tyrosinase and the white masking gene \u2013 we apologize in advance for the oversimplifications that are to ensue. \n\nBlack is usually written as B, Red as O, Dilution as D. In general, a cat has two copies of each gene, one from each parent (except for the red gene which is sex-bound, we\u2019ll return to that later). Each copy can be either dominant, which we\u2019ll denote using an upper case letter, or recessive, which we\u2019ll denote using a lower case letter. Thus for each gene there are three possibilities: either both copies of the gene are dominant, both are recessive, or one is dominant and the other is recessive. When describing a cat we\u2019ll write this as a pair of letters, with the second one possibly being a \u201c-\u201d to indicate a wildcard. For example, \u201cbb\u201d indicates that the cat has two recessive black genes, and \u201cB-\u201d indicates that the cat has a dominant black gene and that we don\u2019t care about whether the other one is dominant or recessive.\n\nWhen a cat has no dominant red (O) gene, its coat will be a variation of black, according to the following four combinations:\n\nB-D-: Black\n\nB-dd: Blue\n\nbbD-: Chocolate\n\nbbdd: Lilac\n\nNow, red (O or o) is sex bound on the X chromosone. This means a male cat, or tom, only has a single red gene, while a female has two. Red dominates black, meaning that a cat having an O gene will always have red coloring. Like black, red is also affected by the dilution gene. For male cats, we have the following two possible red colors (here, the black genes have no effect on the coat color):\n\nD-O: Red\n\nddO: Cream\n\nFor female cats the situation gets a bit more complicated. If the female has two O genes she will be be red, with variations depending on the dilution gene in exactly the same way as for male red cats:\n\nD-OO: Red\n\nddOO: Cream\n\nHowever, a female cat with the Oo combination will have a partially black, partially red, coat. These cats are known as Torties (Tortoiseshells), and named after both their coat colours, starting with the black. The four possible Tortie colorings are thus as follows:\n\nB-D-Oo: Black-Red Tortie\n\nB-ddOo: Blue-Cream Tortie\n\nbbD-Oo: Chocolate-Red Tortie\n\nbbddOo: Lilac-Cream Tortie\n\nWhen a pair of cats have kittens, the offspring will get a random set of genes from their parents according to the following simple process: for each gene, independently, one of the copies is selected uniformly at random from the father\u2019s two copies, and the other copy is selected uniformly at random from the mother\u2019s two copies. For the red gene, there is a $50\\% $ chance that the offspring will be female in which case it will get the father\u2019s red gene (and one of the mother\u2019s red genes at random), and a $50\\% $ chance that the offspring will be male in which case it will only get one of the mother\u2019s red genes (at random).\n\nWrite a program which, given the colors of two cats, computes the most likely color for their offspring. For cats having a color where some genes do not affect the color, assume that the corresponding genes are uniformly random (over the two choices dominant/recessive). For example, if a cat is red, you should assume that the possibilities \u201cDD\u201d and \u201cDd\u201d for the dilution gene are equally likely, and that the four possibilities \u201cBB\u201d, \u201cBb\u201d, \u201cbB\u201d and \u201cbb\u201d are equally likely for the black gene (but note that \u201cBb\u201d and \u201cbB\u201d are equivalent).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line gives the color of the female cat, and the second line gives the color of the male cat. Each color is spelled and capitalized exactly as when it is listed above, and the color is valid (i.e., the male cat won\u2019t be a Tortie).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of the possible color outcomes for the offspring of the two cats. Each line should contain a color followed by a number $0 < p \\le 1$ indicating the probability of this particular outcome.\n\nThe list should be sorted first in decreasing order by probability, then in alphabetic order by name (see sample input 3 below). You do not need to worry about the precise formatting of the probabilities (e.g., number of decimals), but the absolute error of each probability must be smaller than $10^{-9}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nRed\nRed\nSample Output 1:\nRed 0.937500000\nCream 0.062500000\n\nSample Input 2:\nLilac-Cream Tortie\nBlue\nSample Output 2:\nBlue 0.375000000\nCream 0.250000000\nBlue-Cream Tortie 0.187500000\nLilac 0.125000000\nLilac-Cream Tortie 0.062500000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
