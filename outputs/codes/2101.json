You are not allowed to split a pair into independent sticks.\n\nWhat is the maximum area you can achieve?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $R$, $G$, $B$ ($1 \\le R, G, B \\le 200$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs of red sticks, the number of pairs of green sticks and the number of pairs of blue sticks.\n\nThe second line contains $R$ integers $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_R$ ($1 \\le r_i \\le 2000$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of red sticks.\n\nThe third line contains $G$ integers $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_G$ ($1 \\le g_i \\le 2000$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of green sticks.\n\nThe fourth line contains $B$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_B$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 2000$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of blue sticks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible total area of the constructed rectangles.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 1\n3\n5\n4\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n2 1 3\n9 5\n1\n2 8 5\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n10 1 1\n11 7 20 15 19 14 2 4 13 14\n8\n11\n\nOutput\n372\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can construct one of these rectangles: red and green with sides $3$ and $5$, red and blue with sides $3$ and $4$ and green and blue with sides $5$ and $4$. The best area of them is $4 \\times 5 = 20$.\n\nIn the second example the best rectangles are: red/blue $9 \\times 8$, red/blue $5 \\times 5$, green/blue $2 \\times 1$. So the total area is $72 + 25 + 2 = 99$.\n\nIn the third example the best rectangles are: red/green $19 \\times 8$ and red/blue $20 \\times 11$. The total area is $152 + 220 = 372$. Note that you can't construct more rectangles because you are not allowed to have both pairs taken to be the same color.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
