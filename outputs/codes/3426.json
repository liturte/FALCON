Each tunnel connects two stations and the stations are numbered $1$, $\\ldots $, $N$.\n\nErik has had enough of Sk\u00e5netrafiken\u2019s terrible route planning software and plans to build his own. To do this, he needs to know the length of each of the tunnels, but the subway map is incomplete in this regard. By looking out the window, Erik has noticed that some tunnels have special cables running alongside them, probably for providing power to the stations. The cables connect the stations so that every station is connected to the central station (the station numbered $1$). Knowing how greedy Sk\u00e5netrafiken is, he is certain that the cables are placed so that the total length of cable is minimized.\n\nErik knows the precise length of some tunnels, and which tunnels contain cables. Using this information he wants to find the minimum possible length for each tunnel with unknown length. Unfortunately, Erik\u2019s algorithm isn\u2019t efficient enough to process the enormous size of Lund\u2019s subway network. Can you help him by implementing a more efficient algorithm?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$, where $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ and $N - 1 \\leq M \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, the number of stations and the number of tunnels, respectively. Each of the next $M$ lines contains the values $a_ i$, $b_ i$, $l_ i$ and $c_ i$. The integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, with $1 \\leq a_ i, b_ i \\leq N$ and $a_ i\\neq b_ i$, denote the two stations connected by the $i$th tunnel. The value $l_ i$ is either an integer satisfying $1 \\leq l_ i \\leq 10^9$, the length of the $i$th tunnel if it is known, or a question mark \u201c?\u201d. Finally, $c_ i$ is $1$ if the $i$th tunnel contains a cable, and $0$ if not.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one tunnel connecting the same pair of stations, and that it is possible to travel between any pair of stations using the subway. It is also guaranteed that there exists a path between any station and station number $1$ using only tunnels where $c_ i = 1$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each tunnel with $l_ i=\\texttt{?}$, output one line with a single integer, the minimum possible length for that tunnel. Tunnel lengths should be output in the same order as the tunnels are listed in the input.\n\n-----Sample Description-----\nIn the first sample case, the minimal distance for the unknown tunnel (between stations $3$ and $1$) is $5$. This is because, if the length were less than $5$, it would be more efficient for Sk\u00e5netrafiken to run cables through the second and third tunnels.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3\n1 2 5 1\n2 3 3 1\n3 1 ? 0\nSample Output:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
