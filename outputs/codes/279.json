We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.\n\nAssuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 \u2264 v_1, v_2 \u2264 100) \u2014 the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains two integers t (2 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 \u2264 d \u2264 10) \u2014 the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6\n4 2\n\nOutput\n26\nInput\n10 10\n10 0\n\nOutput\n100\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.\n\nIn the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
