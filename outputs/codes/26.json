Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.\n\nWet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. \n\nLet m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.\n\n \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 \u2264 x, y, z \u2264 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFind the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. \n\nx^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity). \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1.1 3.4 2.5\n\nOutput\nz^y^x\n\nInput\n2.0 2.0 2.0\n\nOutput\nx^y^z\n\nInput\n1.9 1.8 1.7\n\nOutput\n(x^y)^z\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
