Also, bank 1 and bank n are neighbours if n > 1. No bank is a neighbour of itself.\n\nVasya has an account in each bank. Its balance may be negative, meaning Vasya owes some money to this bank.\n\nThere is only one type of operations available: transfer some amount of money from any bank to account in any neighbouring bank. There are no restrictions on the size of the sum being transferred or balance requirements to perform this operation.\n\nVasya doesn't like to deal with large numbers, so he asks you to determine the minimum number of operations required to change the balance of each bank account to zero. It's guaranteed, that this is possible to achieve, that is, the total balance of Vasya in all banks is equal to zero.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of banks.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} ( - 10^9 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), the i-th of them is equal to the initial balance of the account in the i-th bank. It's guaranteed that the sum of all a_{i} is equal to 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of operations required to change balance in each bank to zero.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n5 0 -5\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4\n-1 0 1 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 -6\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Vasya may transfer 5 from the first bank to the third.\n\nIn the second sample, Vasya may first transfer 1 from the third bank to the second, and then 1 from the second to the first.\n\nIn the third sample, the following sequence provides the optimal answer:   transfer 1 from the first bank to the second bank;  transfer 3 from the second bank to the third;  transfer 6 from the third bank to the fourth.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
