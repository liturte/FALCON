Jack is a modest student, he doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant. Emma is a girl with high taste, she prefers elite places.\n\nMunhattan consists of n streets and m avenues. There is exactly one restaurant on the intersection of each street and avenue. The streets are numbered with integers from 1 to n and the avenues are numbered with integers from 1 to m. The cost of dinner in the restaurant at the intersection of the i-th street and the j-th avenue is c_{ij}.\n\nJack and Emma decide to choose the restaurant in the following way. Firstly Emma chooses the street to dinner and then Jack chooses the avenue. Emma and Jack makes their choice optimally: Emma wants to maximize the cost of the dinner, Jack wants to minimize it. Emma takes into account that Jack wants to minimize the cost of the dinner. Find the cost of the dinner for the couple in love.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of streets and avenues in Munhattan.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains m integers c_{ij} (1 \u2264 c_{ij} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the cost of the dinner in the restaurant on the intersection of the i-th street and the j-th avenue.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer a \u2014 the cost of the dinner for Jack and Emma.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n4 1 3 5\n2 2 2 2\n5 4 5 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example if Emma chooses the first or the third streets Jack can choose an avenue with the cost of the dinner 1. So she chooses the second street and Jack chooses any avenue. The cost of the dinner is 2.\n\nIn the second example regardless of Emma's choice Jack can choose a restaurant with the cost of the dinner 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
