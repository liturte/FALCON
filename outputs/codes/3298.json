Congratulations! Your primary responsibility is testing the sorting algorithms that your team produces. Fortunately, NASA has a large budget this year, and you were able to buy some state-of-the-art integers you can use to test the sorting algorithms.\n\nAs the lead scientist, you are well aware that algorithms are tested by their behaviour on worst case inputs. So, to test sorting algorithms, you need sequences that are as unsorted as possible.\n\nGiven a sequence of numbers $(a_1,\\ldots ,a_ n)$ we say that an element $a_ k$ is sorted if for all indices $j$ such that $j > k$, $a_ j \\geq a_ k$ and for all indices $j$ such that $j < k$, $a_ j \\leq a_ k$. For example, in\\[ (1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 5) \\]\n\nthe sorted elements are the $1$, the second occurrence of $3$, and the $4$. Note that a sequence is sorted if and only if all its elements are sorted. A sequence is called entirely unsorted if none of its elements are sorted.\n\nGiven a sequence of integers, what is the number of entirely unsorted sequences you can make by permuting its elements? Two sequences $(b_1, \\dots , b_ n)$ and $(c_1, \\dots , c_ n)$ are considered to be different if there is some index $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, \\dots , n \\right\\} $ for which $b_ i \\neq c_ i$. Because the number of permutations may be very large, please give it modulo $10^9 + 9$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with an integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$. Then follows a single line with $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots , a_ n$, with $0 \\leq a_ i \\leq 10^9$ for all $i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer: the number of entirely unsorted sequences you can make by permuting the $a_ i$, modulo $10^9 + 9$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n0 1 2 3\nSample Output 1:\n14\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n1 1 2 1 1\nSample Output 2:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
