Alas, I am getting old and would like to feel young again. Fortunately, I have come up with an excellent way of feeling younger: if I write my age as a number in an appropriately chosen base $b$, then it appears to be smaller. For instance, suppose my age in base $10$ is $32$. Written in base $16$ it is only $20$!\n\nHowever, I cannot choose an arbitrary base when doing this. If my age written in base $b$ contains digits other than $0$ to $9$, then it will be obvious that I am cheating, which defeats the purpose. In addition, if my age written in base $b$ is too small then it would again be obvious that I am cheating.\n\nGiven my age $y$ and a lower bound $\\ell $ on how small I want my age to appear, find the largest base $b$ such that $y$ written in base $b$ contains only decimal digits, and is at least $\\ell $ when interpreted as a number in base $10$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two base 10 integers $y$ ($10 \\le y \\le 10^{18}$ \u2013 yes, I am very old) and $\\ell $ ($10 \\le \\ell \\le y$).\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the largest base $b$ as described above.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n32 20\nSample Output:\n16\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
