She especially loves problems about arrays and queries on them.\n\nRecently, she was presented with an array $a$ of the size of $10^9$ elements that is filled as follows:   $a_1 = -1$  $a_2 = 2$  $a_3 = -3$  $a_4 = 4$  $a_5 = -5$  And so on ... \n\nThat is, the value of the $i$-th element of the array $a$ is calculated using the formula $a_i = i \\cdot (-1)^i$.\n\nShe immediately came up with $q$ queries on this array. Each query is described with two numbers: $l$ and $r$. The answer to a query is the sum of all the elements of the array at positions from $l$ to $r$ inclusive.\n\nMargarita really wants to know the answer to each of the requests. She doesn't want to count all this manually, but unfortunately, she couldn't write the program that solves the problem either. She has turned to you\u00a0\u2014 the best programmer.\n\nHelp her find the answers!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^3$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the queries.\n\nEach of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the descriptions of the queries.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines, each containing one number\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the query. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n1 3\n2 5\n5 5\n4 4\n2 3\n\nOutput\n-2\n-2\n-5\n4\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position $1$ to position $3$. The sum is equal to $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = -1 + 2 -3 = -2$.\n\nIn the second query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position $2$ to position $5$. The sum is equal to $a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 2 -3 + 4 - 5 = -2$.\n\nIn the third query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position $5$ to position $5$. The sum is equal to $a_5 = -5$.\n\nIn the fourth query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position $4$ to position $4$. The sum is equal to $a_4 = 4$.\n\nIn the fifth query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position $2$ to position $3$. The sum is equal to $a_2 + a_3 = 2 - 3 = -1$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
