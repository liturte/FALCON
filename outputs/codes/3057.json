For example, Sheep is the same thing as Heap, Dictionary Attack is the same thing as Stack, and Tree is the same thing as the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nStrangely, some people have objected to M\u00e5rten\u2019s Theorem, despite being rigorously proved by Johan\u2019s infinitely many self-referencing recursive lemmas. You have been given the task of deciding if a number of statements are consistent under M\u00e5rten\u2019s Theorem.\n\nYou will be given a number of statements of the form \"$X$ is $Y$\" or \"$X$ not $Y$\", where $X$ and $Y$ are words consisting solely of the characters \u2019a\u2019-\u2019z\u2019, with a length of 1-20 characters, denoting that $X$ is or isn\u2019t equivalent to $Y$. You must decide whether the statements given are consistent with each other. For example, the two statements ulf is lukas and ulf not lukas contradict each other, and are not consistent with each other.\n\nHowever, you must also take M\u00e5rten\u2019s theorem into account. For the sake of simplicity, we say that two words rhyme if the last $\\min (3, |X|, |Y|)$ characters are the same in two words. So if this condition holds for two words $X$ and $Y$ that are in the list of statements, it is equivalent to having a statement \"$X$ is $Y$\".\n\nNote that words which do not appear in any statement do not exist, and should not be considered rhyming with anything. That is, the two words foo and moo do not rhyme with each other, unless the word oo or o exists in the input.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consists of an integer $0 \\le N \\le 100000$, the number of statements. The next $N$ lines consists of statements of the two given forms.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should consist of the string \"yes\", if the statements are consistent with each other, i.e. everything which is stated to be the same either explicitly or by M\u00e5rten\u2019s Theorem, really is the same. If you can find contradiction, output the string \"wait what?\".\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\nherp is derp\nderp is herp\nherp is herp\nderp is derp\nSample Output 1:\nyes\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\noskar not lukas\noskar is poptart\nlukas is smart\nSample Output 2:\nwait what?\n\nSample Input 3:\n1\nmoo not foo\nSample Output 3:\nyes\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
