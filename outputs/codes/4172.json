In one move, you can make one of the following two operations:\n\n  Take one of the minimum elements of the array and increase its value by one (more formally, if the minimum value of $a$ is $mn$ then you choose such index $i$ that $a_i = mn$ and set $a_i := a_i + 1$);  take one of the maximum elements of the array and decrease its value by one (more formally, if the maximum value of $a$ is $mx$ then you choose such index $i$ that $a_i = mx$ and set $a_i := a_i - 1$). \n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least $k$ equal elements in the array.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements in $a$ and the required number of equal elements.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least $k$ equal elements in the array.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 5\n1 2 2 4 2 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n7 5\n3 3 2 1 1 1 3\n\nOutput\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
