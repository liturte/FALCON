If both players play the same gesture, the round is a tie and neither player will win nor lose.)\nWith his supernatural power, AtCoDeer was able to foresee the gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each of the N turns, before the game starts.\nPlan AtCoDeer's gesture in each turn to maximize AtCoDeer's score.\nThe gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each turn is given by a string s. If the i-th (1\u2266i\u2266N) character in s is g, TopCoDeer will play Rock in the i-th turn. Similarly, if the i-th (1\u2266i\u2266N) character of s in p, TopCoDeer will play Paper in the i-th turn.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2266N\u226610^5\n - N=|s|\n - Each character in s is g or p.\n - The gestures represented by s satisfy the condition (\u203b).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\ns\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the AtCoDeer's maximum possible score.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\ngpg\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n0\n\nPlaying the same gesture as the opponent in each turn results in the score of 0, which is the maximum possible score.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
