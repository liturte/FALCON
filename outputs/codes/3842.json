To become a cool programmer, he needs at least p experience points, and a desired flat in Moscow costs q dollars. Mikhail is determined to follow his dreams and registered at a freelance site.\n\nHe has suggestions to work on n distinct projects. Mikhail has already evaluated that the participation in the i-th project will increase his experience by a_{i} per day and bring b_{i} dollars per day. As freelance work implies flexible working hours, Mikhail is free to stop working on one project at any time and start working on another project. Doing so, he receives the respective share of experience and money. Mikhail is only trying to become a cool programmer, so he is able to work only on one project at any moment of time.\n\nFind the real value, equal to the minimum number of days Mikhail needs to make his dream come true.\n\nFor example, suppose Mikhail is suggested to work on three projects and a_1 = 6, b_1 = 2, a_2 = 1, b_2 = 3, a_3 = 2, b_3 = 6. Also, p = 20 and q = 20. In order to achieve his aims Mikhail has to work for 2.5 days on both first and third projects. Indeed, a_1\u00b72.5 + a_2\u00b70 + a_3\u00b72.5 = 6\u00b72.5 + 1\u00b70 + 2\u00b72.5 = 20 and b_1\u00b72.5 + b_2\u00b70 + b_3\u00b72.5 = 2\u00b72.5 + 3\u00b70 + 6\u00b72.5 = 20.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, p and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of projects and the required number of experience and money.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the daily increase in experience and daily income for working on the i-th project.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a real value\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of days Mikhail needs to get the required amount of experience and money. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 20 20\n6 2\n1 3\n2 6\n\nOutput\n5.000000000000000\n\nInput\n4 1 1\n2 3\n3 2\n2 3\n3 2\n\nOutput\n0.400000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFirst sample corresponds to the example in the problem statement.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
