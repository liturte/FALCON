You have to set such r_1 and r_2 that all the flowers are watered, that is, for each flower, the distance between the flower and the first fountain doesn't exceed r_1, or the distance to the second fountain doesn't exceed r_2. It's OK if some flowers are watered by both fountains.\n\nYou need to decrease the amount of water you need, that is set such r_1 and r_2 that all the flowers are watered and the r_1^2 + r_2^2 is minimum possible. Find this minimum value.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers n, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000,  - 10^7 \u2264 x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \u2264 10^7)\u00a0\u2014 the number of flowers, the coordinates of the first and the second fountain.\n\nNext follow n lines. The i-th of these lines contains integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 10^7 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 10^7)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the i-th flower.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all n + 2 points in the input are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum possible value r_1^2 + r_2^2.
