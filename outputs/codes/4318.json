You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.\nThe height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.\nYou can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.\nFor the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \\leq H_i, H_2 \\leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \\leq H_i.\nFrom how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 20\n - 1 \\leq H_i \\leq 100\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nH_1 H_2 ...
