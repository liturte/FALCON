An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $n - 1$ edges.\n\nYour task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex $1$ to any other vertex is at most $2$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following $n - 1$ lines contain edges: edge $i$ is given as a pair of vertices $u_i, v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex $1$ to any other vertex at most $2$.
