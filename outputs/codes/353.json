This summer, he got a huge wart. Every grandma knows that one should treat warts when the moon goes down. Thus, Vitya has to catch the moment when the moon is down.\n\nMoon cycle lasts 30 days. The size of the visible part of the moon (in Vitya's units) for each day is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then cycle repeats, thus after the second 1 again goes 0.\n\nAs there is no internet in the countryside, Vitya has been watching the moon for n consecutive days and for each of these days he wrote down the size of the visible part of the moon. Help him find out whether the moon will be up or down next day, or this cannot be determined by the data he has.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 92)\u00a0\u2014 the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. \n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 15)\u00a0\u2014 Vitya's records.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the input data is consistent.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day n + 1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day n, then print \"DOWN\" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print \"UP\". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n3 4 5 6 7\n\nOutput\nUP\n\nInput\n7\n12 13 14 15 14 13 12\n\nOutput\nDOWN\n\nInput\n1\n8\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be equal to 8, thus the answer is \"UP\".\n\nIn the second sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be 11, thus the answer is \"DOWN\".\n\nIn the third sample, there is no way to determine whether the size of the moon on the next day will be 7 or 9, thus the answer is -1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
