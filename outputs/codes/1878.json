The rows are numbered by integers from 1 to 100 from bottom to top, the columns are numbered from 1 to 100 from left to right. \n\nIn this table, Vanya chose n rectangles with sides that go along borders of squares (some rectangles probably occur multiple times). After that for each cell of the table he counted the number of rectangles it belongs to and wrote this number into it. Now he wants to find the sum of values in all cells of the table and as the table is too large, he asks you to help him find the result.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of rectangles.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 y_1 \u2264 y_2 \u2264 100), where x_1 and y_1 are the number of the column and row of the lower left cell and x_2 and y_2 are the number of the column and row of the upper right cell of a rectangle.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the sum of all values in the cells of the table.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 1 2 3\n2 2 3 3\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n2\n1 1 3 3\n1 1 3 3\n\nOutput\n18\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote to the first sample test:\n\nValues of the table in the first three rows and columns will be as follows:\n\n121\n\n121\n\n110\n\nSo, the sum of values will be equal to 10.\n\nNote to the second sample test:\n\nValues of the table in the first three rows and columns will be as follows:\n\n222\n\n222\n\n222\n\nSo, the sum of values will be equal to 18.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
