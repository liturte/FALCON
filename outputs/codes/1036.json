Let a and b be the respective winners of these tournaments. a and b then play a match of rock paper scissors, and the winner of this match - or a if the match is drawn - is the winner of the tournament held among Players l through r-1.\nFind the favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2^k-1.\n\n-----Notes-----\n - a\\text{ mod } b denotes the remainder when a is divided by b.\n - The outcome of a match of rock paper scissors is determined as follows:\n - If both players choose the same hand, the match is drawn;\n - R beats S;\n - P beats R;\n - S beats P.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq n,k \\leq 100\n - s is a string of length n consisting of R, P, and S.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nn k\ns\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2^k-1, as R, P, or S.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\nRPS\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nP\n\n - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 1 is P.\n - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 2 through 3 is R.\n - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 3 is P.\nThus, the answer is P.\n   P\n \u250c\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2510\n P   R\n\u250c\u2534\u2510 \u250c\u2534\u2510\nR P S R\n ```\n       S\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n   P       S\n \u250c\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2510   \u250c\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2510\n P   R   S   P\n\u250c\u2534\u2510 \u250c\u2534\u2510 \u250c\u2534\u2510 \u250c\u2534\u2510\nR P S R P S R P\n```\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
