However, to play the game the players should first select such a subsegment of the array that $\\frac{p}{s} = k$, where p is the product of all integers on the given array, s is their sum, and k is a given constant for all subsegments. \n\nNastya wonders how many subsegments of the array fit the described conditions. A subsegment of an array is several consecutive integers of the array.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5), where n is the length of the array and k is the constant described above.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^8)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the number of subsegments such that the ratio between the product and the sum on them is equal to k.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1\n1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 2\n6 3 8 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the only subsegment is [1]. The sum equals 1, the product equals 1, so it suits us because $\\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n\nThere are two suitable subsegments in the second example \u2014 [6, 3] and [3, 8, 1]. Subsegment [6, 3] has sum 9 and product 18, so it suits us because $\\frac{18}{9} = 2$. Subsegment [3, 8, 1] has sum 12 and product 24, so it suits us because $\\frac{24}{12} = 2$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
