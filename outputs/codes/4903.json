The doctor\u2019s instructions are to say \u201caaah\u201d. Unfortunately, the doctors sometimes need Jon Marius to say \u201caaah\u201d for a while, which Jon Marius has never been good at. Each doctor requires a certain level of \u201caah\u201d \u2013 some require \u201caaaaaah\u201d, while others can actually diagnose his throat with just an \u201ch\u201d. (They often diagnose wrongly, but that is beyond the scope of this problem.) Since Jon Marius does not want to go to a doctor and have his time wasted, he wants to compare how long he manages to hold the \u201caaah\u201d with the doctor\u2019s requirements. (After all, who wants to be all like \u201caaah\u201d when the doctor wants you to go \u201caaaaaah\u201d?)\n\nEach day Jon Marius calls up a different doctor and asks them how long his \u201caaah\u201d has to be. Find out if Jon Marius would waste his time going to the given doctor.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line is the \u201caaah\u201d Jon Marius is able to say that day. The second line is the \u201caah\u201d the doctor wants to hear. Only lowercase \u2019a\u2019 and \u2019h\u2019 will be used in the input, and each line will contain between $0$ and $999$ \u2019a\u2019s, inclusive, followed by a single \u2019h\u2019.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cgo\u201d if Jon Marius can go to that doctor, and output \u201cno\u201d otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\naaah\naaaaah\nSample Output:\nno\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
