You have purchased a square-shaped land in Singapore, represented as a square on a two dimensional Cartesian plane. The size of your land is $(4 \\cdot 10^7) \\times (4 \\cdot 10^7)$.\n\nAfter much deliberation, your engineers have devised the optimal shape of your new main office. It will be a grand building, shaped as a convex polygon on the two dimensional grid (a convex polygon is a simple polygon such that for any two of its vertices, the straight line connecting the two vertices is completely inside the polygon). More specifically, your main office is represented by a polygon with at least $3$ vertices such that:\n - Each vertex is located on a lattice point (lattice points are points which coordinates are integers).\n - The coordinates of all vertices are between $0$ and $4 \\cdot 10^7$, inclusively.\n - All vertices are located on distinct points.\n - No three vertices are collinear (that is, no three vertices should be on a line).\n - All the vertices form a convex polygon in some order.\n\nIt is a known fact that the number of vertices composing your main office is very important. A lucky number would positively influence the chance of success for all of your evil missions. Thus, given $N$, the number of vertices of the main office, can you generate any one possible way to construct your main office? That is, you should output any possible set of $N$ locations of the $N$ vertices of your main office that has the properties described earlier.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a non-negative integer $3 \\leq N \\leq 400000$, giving the number of vertices your main office should have.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput exactly $N$ lines. Each line consists of two integers $0 \\le x, y \\le 4 \\cdot 10^7$, denoting the coordinates of a vertex making up your main office. The coordinates can be given in any order and must adhere to your main office\u2019s restrictions as described in the problem statement.\n\nWarning: Your program will have to write lots of output. Please use fast output routine to minimize the risk of getting a \u2018Time Limit Exceeded\u2019 verdict.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\nSample Output:\n0 0\n40000000 0\n0 40000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
