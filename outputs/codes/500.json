She had been ready to start her favourite activity \u2014 origami, but remembered the puzzle that she could not solve.  [Image] \n\nThe tree is a non-oriented connected graph without cycles. In particular, there always are n - 1 edges in a tree with n vertices.\n\nThe puzzle is to position the vertices at the points of the Cartesian plane with integral coordinates, so that the segments between the vertices connected by edges are parallel to the coordinate axes. Also, the intersection of segments is allowed only at their ends. Distinct vertices should be placed at different points. \n\nHelp Dasha to find any suitable way to position the tree vertices on the plane.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if it is possible to position the tree vertices on the plane without violating the condition which is given above, then you can do it by using points with integral coordinates which don't exceed 10^18 in absolute value.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 30) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. \n\nEach of next n - 1 lines contains two integers u_{i}, v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n) that mean that the i-th edge of the tree connects vertices u_{i} and v_{i}.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the described graph is a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the puzzle doesn't have a solution then in the only line print \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, the first line should contain \"YES\". The next n lines should contain the pair of integers x_{i}, y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| \u2264 10^18) \u2014 the coordinates of the point which corresponds to the i-th vertex of the tree.\n\nIf there are several solutions, print any of them. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\nOutput\nYES\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n2 0\n1 -1\n-1 1\n0 2\nInput\n6\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\nOutput\nYES\n3 3\n4 3\n5 3\n6 3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample one of the possible positions of tree is: [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
