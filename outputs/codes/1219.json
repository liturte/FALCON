In order to accomplish his goal, he can pick two consecutive heroes, with powers $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$, remove them and insert a hero with power $-(a_i+a_{i+1})$ back in the same position. \n\nFor example if the array contains the elements $[5, 6, 7, 8]$, he can pick $6$ and $7$ and get $[5, -(6+7), 8] = [5, -13, 8]$.\n\nAfter he will perform this operation $n-1$ times, Mans will end up having only one hero. He wants his power to be as big as possible.
