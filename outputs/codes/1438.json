If you can solve this problem in large constraints, then you can just write a single solution to the both versions. If you find the problem too difficult in large constraints, you can write solution to the simplified version only.\n\nWaking up in the morning, Apollinaria decided to bake cookies. To bake one cookie, she needs n ingredients, and for each ingredient she knows the value a_{i}\u00a0\u2014 how many grams of this ingredient one needs to bake a cookie. To prepare one cookie Apollinaria needs to use all n ingredients.\n\nApollinaria has b_{i} gram of the i-th ingredient. Also she has k grams of a magic powder. Each gram of magic powder can be turned to exactly 1 gram of any of the n ingredients and can be used for baking cookies.\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria is able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of ingredients and the number of grams of the magic powder.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, needed to bake one cookie.\n\nThe third line contains the sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 1000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, which Apollinaria has.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria will be able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n2 1 4\n11 3 16\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4 3\n4 3 5 6\n11 12 14 20\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample it is profitably for Apollinaria to make the existing 1 gram of her magic powder to ingredient with the index 2, then Apollinaria will be able to bake 4 cookies.\n\nIn the second sample Apollinaria should turn 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 1 and 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 3. Then Apollinaria will be able to bake 3 cookies. The remaining 1 gram of the magic powder can be left, because it can't be used to increase the answer.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
