Omkar wants to build his waterslide from the right to the left, so his supports must be nondecreasing in height in order to support the waterslide. In $1$ operation, Omkar can do the following: take any contiguous subsegment of supports which is nondecreasing by heights and add $1$ to each of their heights. \n\nHelp Omkar find the minimum number of operations he needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide!\n\nAn array $b$ is a subsegment of an array $c$ if $b$ can be obtained from $c$ by deletion of several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.\n\nAn array $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ is called nondecreasing if $b_i\\le b_{i+1}$ for every $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 100$).
