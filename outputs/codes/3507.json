Wine boxes are to be arranged into non-empty piles, each pile contains only one type of wine, either white or red. After that, those piles are put into a line so that no two piles belonging to the same kind sit next to each other. In addition, for security reasons, each red wine pile should not have more than $d$ boxes of red wine, although piles of white wine can be arbitrarily large.\n\nYour task is to identify $K$ - the number of different ways to arrange the given wine boxes satisfying all of the above conditions.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains $3$ space separated integers in one line: $R$, $W$, $d$ $(1 \\leq R,W \\leq 10^6, 1 \\leq d \\leq R)$\n\n-----Output-----\nWrite in one line the remainder of $K$ divided by $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Sample Clarification-----\nIn the first sample below, there are $3$ valid arrangements:\n\nIn the second sample below, there are $6$ valid arrangements:\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 2 1\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
