As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.\n\nYour favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.\n\nYou want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and L (1 \u2264 n \u2264 30; 1 \u2264 L \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the costs of bottles of different types.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 12\n20 30 70 90\n\nOutput\n150\n\nInput\n4 3\n10000 1000 100 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n4 3\n10 100 1000 10000\n\nOutput\n30\n\nInput\n5 787787787\n123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321\n\nOutput\n44981600785557577\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.\n\nIn the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.\n\nIn the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
