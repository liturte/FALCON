He doesn't have many toys and thus he often plays with polynomials.\n\nHe considers a polynomial valid if its degree is n and its coefficients are integers not exceeding k by the absolute value. More formally:\n\nLet a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} denote the coefficients, so $P(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \\cdot x^{i}$. Then, a polynomial P(x) is valid if all the following conditions are satisfied:  a_{i} is integer for every i;  |a_{i}| \u2264 k for every i;  a_{n} \u2260 0. \n\nLimak has recently got a valid polynomial P with coefficients a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. He noticed that P(2) \u2260 0 and he wants to change it. He is going to change one coefficient to get a valid polynomial Q of degree n that Q(2) = 0. Count the number of ways to do so. You should count two ways as a distinct if coefficients of target polynoms differ.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the degree of the polynomial and the limit for absolute values of coefficients.\n\nThe second line contains n + 1 integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} (|a_{i}| \u2264 k, a_{n} \u2260 0)\u00a0\u2014 describing a valid polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \\cdot x^{i}$. It's guaranteed that P(2) \u2260 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of ways to change one coefficient to get a valid polynomial Q that Q(2) = 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1000000000\n10 -9 -3 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3 12\n10 -9 -3 5\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2 20\n14 -7 19\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, we are given a polynomial P(x) = 10 - 9x - 3x^2 + 5x^3.\n\nLimak can change one coefficient in three ways:  He can set a_0 =  - 10. Then he would get Q(x) =  - 10 - 9x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) =  - 10 - 18 - 12 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_2 =  - 8. Then Q(x) = 10 - 9x - 8x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 18 - 32 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_1 =  - 19. Then Q(x) = 10 - 19x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 38 - 12 + 40 = 0. \n\nIn the second sample, we are given the same polynomial. This time though, k is equal to 12 instead of 10^9. Two first of ways listed above are still valid but in the third way we would get |a_1| > k what is not allowed. Thus, the answer is 2 this time.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
