The binary representation of $2$ is 10 and that of $3$ is 11. Since $\\max(k - 2, 1)$ is equal to $1$, the value of the subsequence is $2^0 + 2^1$ (both $2$ and $3$ have $1$-st bit set in their binary representation and $3$ has $0$-th bit set in its binary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence $\\{{3\\}}$ or $\\{{2, 1, 3\\}}$.\n\nFor the second test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $\\{{3, 4\\}}$ with value $7$.\n\nFor the third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $\\{{1\\}}$ with value $1$.\n\nFor the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $\\{{7, 7\\}}$ with value $7$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
