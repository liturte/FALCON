On a player\u2019s turn, she must perform the following actions in order:\n - Draw a single card from the top of the deck.\n - If the drawn card is an \u201cExploding Kitten\u201d, she must leave the game unless she has a \u201cDefuse\u201d card in her hand, in which case she must discard both the \u201cExploding Kitten\u201d card and the \u201cDefuse\u201d card, so that these two cards will never be drawn again in the same game. Otherwise, she can choose to do nothing.\n - If she has more than five cards in his hand, she must discard cards until he has no more than five cards.\n\nPlayers alternate turns in a single round, and the relative orders in which players take turns must be identical between rounds. When a player leaves the game, the relative draw order of other players will stay the same. The last player left in the game is the winner, and the game will stop at that point.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to watch the game because there\u2019s no skill involved, but you still would like to know the result. You somehow know the location of all \u201cExploding Kittens\u201d and \u201cDefuse\u201d cards in the deck. Assuming everyone starts with an empty hand and plays optimally (i.e. discard \u201cDefuse\u201d cards only when absolutely necessary), who will win the game?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consists of three integers $N$, the number of players in the game, $E$, the number of \u201cExploding Kitten\u201d cards, and $D$, the number of \u201cDefuse\u201d cards. Note that $2\\leq N\\leq 1000$ and $2\\leq D, E\\leq 10000$.\n\nThe next line of the input contains $E$ integers $e_ i$ ($0\\leq e_ i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^9$). This represents the number of cards between a \u201cExploding Kitten\u201d card and the top card of the deck.\n\nThe final line of the input contains $D$ integers $d_ i$ ($0\\leq d_ i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^9$). This represents the number of cards between a \u201cDefuse\u201d card and the top of the deck.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all \u201cExploding Kittens\u201d and \u201cDefuse\u201d cards given in the input are located at distinct locations within the deck.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is a winner, print the ID of the winner, defined as the number of players who took their turn before the winner on the first round. Otherwise, print $-1$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 4 3\n3 4 5 7\n1 2 10\nSample Output 1:\n0\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 5 2\n1 4 7 9 11\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
