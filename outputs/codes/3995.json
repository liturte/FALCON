Let's call a string $t$ a substring of string $s$, if there exists such number $1 \\leq l \\leq |s| - |t| + 1$ that $t = s_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{l + |t| - 1}$. Let's call a substring $t$ of string $s$ unique, if there exist only one such $l$. \n\nFor example, let $s = $\"1010111\". A string $t = $\"010\" is an unique substring of $s$, because $l = 2$ is the only one suitable number. But, for example $t = $\"10\" isn't a unique substring of $s$, because $l = 1$ and $l = 3$ are suitable. And for example $t =$\"00\" at all isn't a substring of $s$, because there is no suitable $l$.\n\nToday Vasya solved the following problem at the informatics lesson: given a string consisting of symbols \"0\" and \"1\", the task is to find the length of its minimal unique substring. He has written a solution to this problem and wants to test it. He is asking you to help him.\n\nYou are given $2$ positive integers $n$ and $k$, such that $(n \\bmod 2) = (k \\bmod 2)$, where $(x \\bmod 2)$ is operation of taking remainder of $x$ by dividing on $2$. Find any string $s$ consisting of $n$ symbols \"0\" or \"1\", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$, separated by spaces ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$, $(k \\bmod 2) = (n \\bmod 2)$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of symbols \"0\" and \"1\". Minimal length of the unique substring of $s$ should be equal to $k$. You can find any suitable string. It is guaranteed, that there exists at least one such string.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 4\n\nOutput\n1111\nInput\n5 3\n\nOutput\n01010\nInput\n7 3\n\nOutput\n1011011\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, it's easy to see, that the only unique substring of string $s = $\"1111\" is all string $s$, which has length $4$.\n\nIn the second test a string $s = $\"01010\" has minimal unique substring $t =$\"101\", which has length $3$.\n\nIn the third test a string $s = $\"1011011\" has minimal unique substring $t =$\"110\", which has length $3$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
