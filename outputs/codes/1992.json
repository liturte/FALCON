The smartphone menu has exactly n applications, each application has its own icon. The icons are located on different screens, one screen contains k icons. The icons from the first to the k-th one are located on the first screen, from the (k + 1)-th to the 2k-th ones are on the second screen and so on (the last screen may be partially empty).\n\nInitially the smartphone menu is showing the screen number 1. To launch the application with the icon located on the screen t, Anya needs to make the following gestures: first she scrolls to the required screen number t, by making t - 1 gestures (if the icon is on the screen t), and then make another gesture \u2014 press the icon of the required application exactly once to launch it.\n\nAfter the application is launched, the menu returns to the first screen. That is, to launch the next application you need to scroll through the menu again starting from the screen number 1.\n\nAll applications are numbered from 1 to n. We know a certain order in which the icons of the applications are located in the menu at the beginning, but it changes as long as you use the operating system. Berdroid is intelligent system, so it changes the order of the icons by moving the more frequently used icons to the beginning of the list. Formally, right after an application is launched, Berdroid swaps the application icon and the icon of a preceding application (that is, the icon of an application on the position that is smaller by one in the order of menu). The preceding icon may possibly be located on the adjacent screen. The only exception is when the icon of the launched application already occupies the first place, in this case the icon arrangement doesn't change.\n\nAnya has planned the order in which she will launch applications. How many gestures should Anya make to launch the applications in the planned order? \n\nNote that one application may be launched multiple times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three numbers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n, m, k \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of applications that Anya has on her smartphone, the number of applications that will be launched and the number of icons that are located on the same screen.\n\nThe next line contains n integers, permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the initial order of icons from left to right in the menu (from the first to the last one), a_{i}\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 is the id of the application, whose icon goes i-th in the menu. Each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once among a_{i}.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}(1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the ids of the launched applications in the planned order. One application may be launched multiple times.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of gestures that Anya needs to make to launch all the applications in the desired order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8 3 3\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 8 1\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n5 4 2\n3 1 5 2 4\n4 4 4 4\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test the initial configuration looks like (123)(456)(78), that is, the first screen contains icons of applications 1, 2, 3, the second screen contains icons 4, 5, 6, the third screen contains icons 7, 8. \n\nAfter application 7 is launched, we get the new arrangement of the icons\u00a0\u2014\u00a0(123)(457)(68). To launch it Anya makes 3 gestures. \n\nAfter application 8 is launched, we get configuration (123)(457)(86). To launch it Anya makes 3 gestures. \n\nAfter application 1 is launched, the arrangement of icons in the menu doesn't change. To launch it Anya makes 1 gesture.\n\nIn total, Anya makes 7 gestures.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
