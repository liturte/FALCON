All numbers in the array are either between $1$ and $k$ (inclusive), or equal to $-1$. The array is good if there is no segment of $len$ consecutive equal numbers.\n\nVasya will replace each $-1$ with some number from $1$ to $k$ (inclusive) in such a way that the resulting array is good. Tell him the number of ways to do this replacement. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n, k$ and $len$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 100, 1 \\le len \\le n$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ numbers \u2014 the array. Each number is either $-1$ or between $1$ and $k$ (inclusive).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of ways to replace each $-1$ with some number from $1$ to $k$ (inclusive) so the array is good.
