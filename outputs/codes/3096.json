Also, each employee of the company except Petar has exactly one supervisor. Since Petar is the CEO of the company, he has the label $1$ and is directly or indirectly superordinate to all the employees.\n\nAt the birthday party, there are certain rules that all people present (including Petar) must follow.\n - At the party, there shouldn\u2019t be two people that tell the same type of jokes.\n - Person $X$ cannot be invited if their direct supervisor is not invited.\n - Person $X$ cannot be invited if the set of jokes the invitees that person $X$ is superior to (directly or indirectly) tell and person $X$ don\u2019t form a set of consecutive numbers.\n\nThe numbers in the set are consecutive if the difference between adjacent elements is exactly $1$ when the set is sorted ascendingly. For example, $(3, 1, 2)$ and $(5, 1, 2, 4, 3)$. Petar wants to know how many different sets of jokes he can see at his party with the listed constraints.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$, ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10\\ 000$). The second line of input contains $N$ integers, the types of jokes person $i$ tells, $V_ i$, ($1 \\leq V_ i \\leq 100$). Each of the following $N-1$ lines contains two integers $A$ and $B$, ($1 \\leq A, B \\leq N$), denoting that person $A$ is directly superior to person $B$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the number of different sets of jokes that comply to the previously listed constraints.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n2 1 3 4\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n3 4 5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\nSample Output 2:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
