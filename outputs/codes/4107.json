Rooms are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nYou have to connect all $n$ rooms to the Internet.\n\nYou can connect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for the $i$-th room is $i$ coins. \n\nSome rooms also have a spot for a router. The cost of placing a router in the $i$-th room is also $i$ coins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it. When you place a router in the room $i$, you connect all rooms with the numbers from $max(1,~i - k)$ to $min(n,~i + k)$ inclusive to the Internet, where $k$ is the range of router. The value of $k$ is the same for all routers. \n\nCalculate the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of rooms and the range of each router.\n\nThe second line of the input contains one string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the $i$-th room. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '0' then you cannot place a router in the $i$-th room.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n00100\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6 1\n000000\n\nOutput\n21\n\nInput\n4 1\n0011\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n12 6\n000010000100\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is enough to place the router in the room $3$, then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is $3$.\n\nIn the second example you can place routers nowhere, so you need to connect all rooms directly. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\n\nIn the third example you need to connect the room $1$ directly and place the router in the room $3$. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nIn the fourth example you need to place routers in rooms $5$ and $10$. Then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is $5 + 10 = 15$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
