Specifically, he is now studying the expose procedure.\n\nUnfortunately, Rostislav is unable to understand the definition of this procedure, so he decided to ask programmer Serezha to help him. Serezha agreed to help if Rostislav solves a simple task (and if he doesn't, then why would he need Splay trees anyway?)\n\nGiven integers l, r and k, you need to print all powers of number k within range from l to r inclusive. However, Rostislav doesn't want to spent time doing this, as he got interested in playing a network game called Agar with Gleb. Help him!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers l, r and k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^18, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint all powers of number k, that lie within range from l to r in the increasing order. If there are no such numbers, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 10 2\n\nOutput\n1 2 4 8 \nInput\n2 4 5\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote to the first sample: numbers 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8 lie within the specified range. The number 2^4 = 16 is greater then 10, thus it shouldn't be printed.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
