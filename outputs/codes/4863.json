For most Vietnamese high school students, this is their most important exam, as its result not only decides whether they can graduate from high school, but is also used for their university applications.\n\nToday, Hanh finished his final exam, Math, which is Hanh\u2019s strongest subject. In this exam, there are $n$ questions, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each one is a multiple choice question, with $4$ answers, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The students have to write the answers on an answer sheet with $n$ lines, the $i$-th line should contain the answer for the $i$-th question. Each question has only one correct answer, and the student will receive one point if their answer matches the correct one.\n\nHanh started checking his results with his friends confidently. After few minutes, Hanh\u2019s confidence turned into fright: Most of Hanh\u2019s answers are different from his friends\u2019.\n\nHanh quickly realized that he made a terrible mistake: Hanh wrote the answer for the $2$nd question on the $1$st line of the answer sheet, the answer for the $3$rd question on the $2$nd line, the answer for the $4$th question on the $3$rd line, and so on. Hanh left the $n$-th line of the answer sheet empty, and did not write the answer for the $1$st question anywhere!\n\nPlease help Hanh check what will be his final score. Given that Hanh is a great Math student, his answers for all $n$ questions would be correct if they were on the correct line of the answer sheet.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 1000)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of questions.\n - $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains a single character, $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$\u00a0\u2014 the correct answer for the $i$-th question.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 Hanh\u2019s final score.\n\n-----Explanation of the first sample input-----\nFortunately for Hanh, all $4$ questions have $A$ as correct answer. So Hanh wrote $A$ on the first three lines, and left the $4$-th line empty. Hanh\u2019s final score is $3$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\nA\nA\nA\nA\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
