There are $n$ shrubs, and each shrub has $a_i$ red berries and $b_i$ blue berries.\n\nEach basket can contain $k$ berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.\n\nFor example, if there are two shrubs with $5$ red and $2$ blue berries in the first shrub and $2$ red and $1$ blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill $2$ baskets of capacity $4$ completely:   the first basket will contain $3$ red and $1$ blue berries from the first shrub;  the second basket will contain the $2$ remaining red berries from the first shrub and $2$ red berries from the second shrub. \n\nHelp Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($ 1\\le n, k \\le 500$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of shrubs and the basket capacity, respectively.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contain two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($0 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of red and blue berries in the $i$-th shrub, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of baskets that Phoenix can fill completely.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 4\n5 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 5\n2 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2 5\n2 1\n1 3\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n1 2\n1000000000 1\n\nOutput\n500000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described above.\n\nIn the second example, Phoenix can fill one basket fully using all the berries from the first (and only) shrub.\n\nIn the third example, Phoenix cannot fill any basket completely because there are less than $5$ berries in each shrub, less than $5$ total red berries, and less than $5$ total blue berries.\n\nIn the fourth example, Phoenix can put all the red berries into baskets, leaving an extra blue berry behind.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
