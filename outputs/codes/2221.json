Initially you are standing in a point $(x_1, y_1)$ (obviously, all positions in the sea can be described by cartesian plane) and you want to travel to a point $(x_2, y_2)$. \n\nYou know the weather forecast \u2014 the string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R. The letter corresponds to a direction of wind. Moreover, the forecast is periodic, e.g. the first day wind blows to the side $s_1$, the second day \u2014 $s_2$, the $n$-th day \u2014 $s_n$ and $(n+1)$-th day \u2014 $s_1$ again and so on. \n\nShip coordinates change the following way:  if wind blows the direction U, then the ship moves from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  if wind blows the direction D, then the ship moves from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  if wind blows the direction L, then the ship moves from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  if wind blows the direction R, then the ship moves from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. \n\nThe ship can also either go one of the four directions or stay in place each day. If it goes then it's exactly 1 unit of distance. Transpositions of the ship and the wind add up. If the ship stays in place, then only the direction of wind counts. For example, if wind blows the direction U and the ship moves the direction L, then from point $(x, y)$ it will move to the point $(x - 1, y + 1)$, and if it goes the direction U, then it will move to the point $(x, y + 2)$.\n\nYou task is to determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $(x_2, y_2)$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $x_1, y_1$ ($0 \\le x_1, y_1 \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the initial coordinates of the ship.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $x_2, y_2$ ($0 \\le x_2, y_2 \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the coordinates of the destination point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the initial coordinates and destination point coordinates are different.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the length of the string $s$.\n\nThe fourth line contains the string $s$ itself, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line should contain the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $(x_2, y_2)$.\n\nIf it's impossible then print \"-1\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0\n4 6\n3\nUUU\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n0 3\n0 0\n3\nUDD\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n0 0\n0 1\n1\nL\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: \"RRRRU\".

Then its coordinates will change accordingly: $(0, 3)$ $\\rightarrow$ $(0, 3)$ $\\rightarrow$ $(0, 1)$ $\\rightarrow$ $(0, 0)$.\n\nIn the third example the ship can never reach the point $(0, 1)$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
