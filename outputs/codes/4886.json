He then secretly selects a number from $1$ to $N$ (inclusive), and does not tell you this number.\n\nYour goal is to correctly guess the secret number. Before guessing, you are allowed to ask $K$ \u201ctrue/false\u201d questions about the number, for example, \u201cIs the number even?\u201d or \u201cIs the number between $7$ and $10$?\u201d, or \u201cIs the number $17$ or $22$?\u201d, or \u201cIs the number prime?\u201d. And the Wizard will answer with \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d to each question. The Wizard will always answer honestly. After answering the $K$ questions, you must guess the number. If you win (guess the number correctly), you will be granted your wish; but if the Wizard wins (you guess incorrectly), you will be turned into a flying monkey.\n\n(Formally, you can think of a \u201cquestion\u201d as a function from $1, 2, \\ldots , N$ to true, false, and the Wizard will answer by telling you whether the value of the function is true or false for his secret number.)\n\nAssuming that you have been told $N$ and $K$, can you always exactly determine the Wizard\u2019s secret number (and guarantee that you win) using only $K$ questions?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two integers $N$ and $K$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 10^{101}$, $0 \\leq K \\leq N$), separated by a single space.\n\nNote: These inputs might NOT fit into a $64$-bit integer.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201cYour wish is granted!\u201d (without the quotes) if it is possible for you to guarantee that you win the game (regardless of the number the Wizard picks). Otherwise, print \u201cYou will become a flying monkey!\u201d (without the quotes) if it is not possible.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n8 3\nSample Output:\nYour wish is granted!\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
