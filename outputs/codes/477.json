He brought an n \u00d7 m chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b.\n\nDima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:\n\n  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y - b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y - b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y + b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y + b). \n\nNaturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.\n\nInna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6;\u00a01 \u2264 i \u2264 n;\u00a01 \u2264 j \u2264 m;\u00a01 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^6).\n\nYou can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.\n\nIf Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line \"Poor Inna and pony!\" without the quotes.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 7 1 3 2 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5 5 2 3 1 1\n\nOutput\nPoor Inna and pony!\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote to sample 1:\n\nInna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the corner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals two.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
