She noticed strings s and t, lengths of which are n and m respectively. As usual, reading bored Alyona and she decided to pay her attention to strings s and t, which she considered very similar.\n\nAlyona has her favourite positive integer k and because she is too small, k does not exceed 10. The girl wants now to choose k disjoint non-empty substrings of string s such that these strings appear as disjoint substrings of string t and in the same order as they do in string s. She is also interested in that their length is maximum possible among all variants.\n\nFormally, Alyona wants to find a sequence of k non-empty strings p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_{k} satisfying following conditions:  s can be represented as concatenation a_1p_1a_2p_2... a_{k}p_{k}a_{k} + 1, where a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} + 1 is a sequence of arbitrary strings (some of them may be possibly empty);  t can be represented as concatenation b_1p_1b_2p_2... b_{k}p_{k}b_{k} + 1, where b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k} + 1 is a sequence of arbitrary strings (some of them may be possibly empty);  sum of the lengths of strings in sequence is maximum possible. \n\nPlease help Alyona solve this complicated problem and find at least the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequence.\n\nA substring of a string is a subsequence of consecutive characters of the string.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn the first line of the input three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10) are given\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string s, the length of the string t and Alyona's favourite number respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains string s, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line of the input contains string t, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the only non-negative integer\u00a0\u2014 the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequence.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that at least one desired sequence exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2 2\nabc\nab\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n9 12 4\nbbaaababb\nabbbabbaaaba\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe following image describes the answer for the second sample case: [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
