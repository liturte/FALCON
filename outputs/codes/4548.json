Your goal is to reach Square 0 or Square N.\nHowever, for each i = 1, 2, ..., M, there is a toll gate in Square A_i, and traveling to Square A_i incurs a cost of 1.\nIt is guaranteed that there is no toll gate in Square 0, Square X and Square N.\nFind the minimum cost incurred before reaching the goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 100\n - 1 \\leq X \\leq N - 1\n - 1 \\leq A_1 < A_2 < ... < A_M \\leq N\n - A_i \\neq X\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M X\nA_1 A_2 ...

Here, there is a toll gate in Square 4, so the cost of 1 is incurred.\n - Then, travel from Square 4 to Square 5. This time, no cost is incurred.\n - Now, we are in Square 5 and we have reached the goal.\nIn this case, the total cost incurred is 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
