Vasya immediately went to the store and bought n colored sheets of paper, the area of each sheet is 1 square meter.\n\nThe garland must consist of exactly m pieces of colored paper of arbitrary area, each piece should be of a certain color. To make the garland, Vasya can arbitrarily cut his existing colored sheets into pieces. Vasya is not obliged to use all the sheets to make the garland.\n\nVasya wants the garland to be as attractive as possible, so he wants to maximize the total area of \u200b\u200bm pieces of paper in the garland. Calculate what the maximum total area of \u200b\u200bthe pieces of paper in the garland Vasya can get.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a non-empty sequence of n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) small English letters (\"a\"...\"z\"). Each letter means that Vasya has a sheet of paper of the corresponding color.\n\nThe second line contains a non-empty sequence of m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) small English letters that correspond to the colors of the pieces of paper in the garland that Vasya wants to make.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint an integer that is the maximum possible total area of the pieces of paper in the garland Vasya wants to get or -1, if it is impossible to make the garland from the sheets he's got. It is guaranteed that the answer is always an integer.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\naaabbac\naabbccac\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\na\nz\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test sample Vasya can make an garland of area 6: he can use both sheets of color b, three (but not four) sheets of color a and cut a single sheet of color c in three, for example, equal pieces. Vasya can use the resulting pieces to make a garland of area 6.\n\nIn the second test sample Vasya cannot make a garland at all \u2014 he doesn't have a sheet of color z.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
