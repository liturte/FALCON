He has stated a following hypothesis: \"There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n\u00b7m + 1 is a prime number\".\n\nUnfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only number in the input is n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput such m that n\u00b7m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nA prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nFor the first sample testcase, 3\u00b71 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.\n\nIn the second sample testcase, 4\u00b71 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4\u00b72 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
