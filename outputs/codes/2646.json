Passage i connects Room A_i and Room B_i bidirectionally. One can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages. Room 1 is a special room with an entrance from the outside.\nIt is dark in the cave, so we have decided to place a signpost in each room except Room 1. The signpost in each room will point to one of the rooms directly connected to that room with a passage.\nSince it is dangerous in the cave, our objective is to satisfy the condition below for each room except Room 1.\n - If you start in that room and repeatedly move to the room indicated by the signpost in the room you are in, you will reach Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible.\nDetermine whether there is a way to place signposts satisfying our objective, and print one such way if it exists.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq N\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq M)\n - A_i \\neq B_i\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq M)\n - One can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nA_1 B_1\n:\nA_M B_M\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is no way to place signposts satisfying the objective, print No.\nOtherwise, print N lines. The first line should contain Yes, and the i-th line (2 \\leq i \\leq N) should contain the integer representing the room indicated by the signpost in Room i.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n1\n2\n2\n\nIf we place the signposts as described in the sample output, the following happens:\n - Starting in Room 2, you will reach Room 1 after traversing one passage: (2) \\to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.\n - Starting in Room 3, you will reach Room 1 after traversing two passages: (3) \\to 2 \\to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.\n - Starting in Room 4, you will reach Room 1 after traversing two passages: (4) \\to 2 \\to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.\nThus, the objective is satisfied.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
