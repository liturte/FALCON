The programming skill of the $i$-th student is $a_i$. As a coach, you want to divide them into teams to prepare them for the upcoming ICPC finals. Just imagine how good this university is if it has $2 \\cdot 10^5$ students ready for the finals!\n\nEach team should consist of at least three students. Each student should belong to exactly one team. The diversity of a team is the difference between the maximum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team and the minimum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team (in other words, if the team consists of $k$ students with programming skills $a[i_1], a[i_2], \\dots, a[i_k]$, then the diversity of this team is $\\max\\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j] - \\min\\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j]$).\n\nThe total diversity is the sum of diversities of all teams formed.\n\nYour task is to minimize the total diversity of the division of students and find the optimal way to divide the students.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of students.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the programming skill of the $i$-th student.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print two integers $res$ and $k$ \u2014 the minimum total diversity of the division of students and the number of teams in your division, correspondingly.\n\nIn the second line print $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le k$), where $t_i$ is the number of team to which the $i$-th student belong.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of teams. Each team should consist of at least three students.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 1 3 4 2\n\nOutput\n3 1\n1 1 1 1 1 \n\nInput\n6\n1 5 12 13 2 15\n\nOutput\n7 2\n2 2 1 1 2 1 \n\nInput\n10\n1 2 5 129 185 581 1041 1909 1580 8150\n\nOutput\n7486 3\n3 3 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there is only one team with skills $[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ so the answer is $3$. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better answer.\n\nIn the second example, there are two teams with skills $[1, 2, 5]$ and $[12, 13, 15]$ so the answer is $4 + 3 = 7$.\n\nIn the third example, there are three teams with skills $[1, 2, 5]$, $[129, 185, 581, 1041]$ and $[1580, 1909, 8150]$ so the answer is $4 + 912 + 6570 = 7486$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
