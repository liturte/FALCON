Each edge has a color. For simplicity, each color is identified by a number between $1$ and $300$ inclusive. Interestingly, you noticed that for each and every simple cycle in this graph, there are at least two adjacent edges on this cycle which have the same color.\n\nFor each non-empty subset of nodes in graph $S$, let $f(S)$ denote the size of the maximum subset of nodes you can choose from $S$ such that all edges between the chosen nodes are the same color. Compute the sum of $f(S)$ over all non empty subsets $S$ of nodes in the graph.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will contain a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 300$), which is the number of nodes in the graph.\n\nThe next $n$ lines will each contain $n$ integers $c$ ($0 \\le c \\le 300$), which is a matrix representing the colors of the edges, where $c[x,y]$ is the color of the edge between node $x$ and node $y$. It is guaranteed that the values on the diagonal will be $0$ ($c[x,x]=0$), since there is no edge from a node to itself. It is also guaranteed that the matrix is symmetric and the off-diagonal colors range from $1$ to $300$ ($1 \\le c[x,y] = c[y,x] \\le 300$ for $x \\ne y$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the sum of $f(S)$ over all non empty subsets $S$ of nodes in the graph. Since this number may be very large, output it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 2 2\n1 2 0 3\n1 2 3 0\nSample Output:\n26\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
