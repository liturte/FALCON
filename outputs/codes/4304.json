For some two adjacent towers located 1 meter apart, we measured the lengths of the parts of those towers that are not covered with snow, and the results are a meters for the west tower, and b meters for the east tower.\nAssuming that the depth of snow cover and the altitude are the same everywhere in the village, find the amount of the snow cover.\nAssume also that the depth of the snow cover is always at least 1 meter.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq a < b < 499500(=1+2+3+...+999)\n - All values in input are integers.\n - There is no input that contradicts the assumption.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the depth of the snow cover is x meters, print x as an integer.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8 13\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\nThe heights of the two towers are 10 meters and 15 meters, respectively.\nThus, we can see that the depth of the snow cover is 2 meters.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
