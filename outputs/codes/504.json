As \"BrainStone\" is a pretty intellectual game, Max has to solve numerous hard problems during the gameplay. Here is one of them:\n\nMax owns n creatures, i-th of them can be described with two numbers \u2014 its health hp_{i} and its damage dmg_{i}. Max also has two types of spells in stock:  Doubles health of the creature (hp_{i} := hp_{i}\u00b72);  Assigns value of health of the creature to its damage (dmg_{i} := hp_{i}). \n\nSpell of first type can be used no more than a times in total, of the second type \u2014 no more than b times in total. Spell can be used on a certain creature multiple times. Spells can be used in arbitrary order. It isn't necessary to use all the spells.\n\nMax is really busy preparing for his final exams, so he asks you to determine what is the maximal total damage of all creatures he can achieve if he uses spells in most optimal way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, a, b (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 a \u2264 20, 0 \u2264 b \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of creatures, spells of the first type and spells of the second type, respectively.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contain two number hp_{i} and dmg_{i} (1 \u2264 hp_{i}, dmg_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 description of the i-th creature.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer \u2014 maximum total damage creatures can deal.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1 1\n10 15\n6 1\n\nOutput\n27\n\nInput\n3 0 3\n10 8\n7 11\n5 2\n\nOutput\n26\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Max should use the spell of the first type on the second creature, then the spell of the second type on the same creature. Then total damage will be equal to 15 + 6\u00b72 = 27.\n\nIn the second example Max should use the spell of the second type on the first creature, then the spell of the second type on the third creature. Total damage will be equal to 10 + 11 + 5 = 26.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
