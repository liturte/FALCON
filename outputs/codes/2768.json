The sides of the cubes are the same length as the sides of the squares. When a cube is put on the surface, its sides are aligned with some square. A cube may be put on another cube too.\n\nKids enjoy building forts and hiding them, but they always leave behind a huge mess. Because of this, prior to closing the kindergarten, the teachers rearrange all the cubes so that they occupy a rectangle on the surface, with exactly one cube on every square in the rectangle.\n\nIn one move, a cube is taken off the top of a square to the top of any other square.\n\nWrite a program that, given the state of the surface, calculates the smallest number of moves needed to arrange all cubes into a rectangle.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100$, $1 \\le M \\le N^2$), the dimensions of the surface and the number of cubes currently on the surface.\n\nEach of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \\le R, C \\le N$), the coordinates of the square that contains the cube.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the smallest number of moves. A solution will always exist.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Data-----\nIn the first example, it suffices to move one of the cubes from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 2)$ or $(2, 1)$.\n\nIn the third example, a cube is moved from $(2, 3)$ to $(3, 3)$, from $(4, 2)$ to $(2, 5)$ and from $(4, 4)$ to $(3, 5)$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n1 1\n1 1\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 3\n2 2\n4 4\n1 1\nSample Output 2:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
