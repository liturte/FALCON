Determine if there exists an integer i satisfying the following condition, and find the minimum such i if it exists.\n - Let s' be the concatenation of 10^{100} copies of s. t is a subsequence of the string {s'}_1{s'}_2\\ldots{s'}_i (the first i characters in s').\n\n-----Notes-----\n - A subsequence of a string a is a string obtained by deleting zero or more characters from a and concatenating the remaining characters without changing the relative order. For example, the subsequences of contest include net, c, and contest.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq |s| \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq |t| \\leq 10^5\n - s and t consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\ns\nt\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there exists an integer i satisfying the following condition, print the minimum such i; otherwise, print -1.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\ncontest\nson\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n10\n\nt = son is a subsequence of the string contestcon (the first 10 characters in s' = contestcontestcontest...), so i = 10 satisfies the condition.\nOn the other hand, t is not a subsequence of the string contestco (the first 9 characters in s'), so i = 9 does not satisfy the condition.\nSimilarly, any integer less than 9 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, the minimum integer i satisfying the condition is 10.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
