Gon is now saying goodbye to his best friend, Killua, as Gon wants to visit his home in \u2018While Island\u2019.\n\nGon and Killua plan to use the online chat application, Olaz, to keep in touch. However, they are not confident with Olaz\u2019s security: some imposters may be able to login to Gon\u2019s account and send messages to Killua! To prevent this, they have decided to use the following method:\n - Before starting a conversation, Gon must send Killua a number $X$ with exactly $n$ digits.\n - Killua must reply with an integer $Y$ with exactly $n$ digits, where $X$ and $Y$ form a best friend pair.\n - Each time they start a conversation, they must use a different best friend pair. This would avoid imposters from simply reusing the previous best friend pairs.\n\nTo define a best friend pair, first we define a friendly operation on a number $X$ as follow:\n - Select two adjacent digits of $X$.\n - Either add $1$ to both digits, or subtract $1$ from both digits.\n - It is forbidden to add $1$ to digit $9$, or subtract $1$ from digit $0$.\n - It is also forbidden to subtract $1$ from the first digit of $X$, if the first digit of $X$ is $1$.\n\nNote that the last two conditions guarantee that the new number is valid and does not have leading zero. The new and old numbers will also have the same length.\n\nTwo numbers $X$ and $Y$ without leading zeros are called best friends, if we can obtain $Y$ from $X$, by applying a finite number of friendly operations. Note that a number $X$ is best friend with itself.\n\nFor example, $666$ and $875$ are best friends because we can apply the operations as follow:\n - $666 \\rightarrow 776$\n - $776 \\rightarrow 886$\n - $886 \\rightarrow 875$\n\nNow Gon is wondering how many conversation can they have, before running out of best friend pairs.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains exactly one integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 10^5)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains exactly one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs of best friend numbers with exactly $n$ digits, modulo $998244353$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nSample Output:\n10\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
