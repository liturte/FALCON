The spots are labeled from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $0$ and $h$.\n\nIn each spot, if a house has height $a$, you will gain $a^2$ dollars from it.\n\nThe city has $m$ zoning restrictions. The $i$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $l_i$ to $r_i$ (inclusive) must be at most $x_i$.\n\nYou would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $h$, and $m$ ($1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.\n\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $l_i$, $r_i$, and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$)\u00a0\u2014 left and right limits (inclusive) of the $i$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nOutput\n14\n\nInput\n4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nOutput\n262\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $3$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $3$, and there are $3$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $1$ and $1$ must be at most $1$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $2$ and $2$ must be at most $3$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $3$ and $3$ must be at most $2$.\n\nIn this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $[1, 3, 2]$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$.\n\nIn the second example, there are $4$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $10$, and there are $2$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $2$ to $3$ must be at most $8$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $3$ to $4$ must be at most $7$.\n\nIn this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $[10, 8, 7, 7]$. We get a profit of $10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $3$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $1$, we must still limit its height to be at most $10$ ($h=10$).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
