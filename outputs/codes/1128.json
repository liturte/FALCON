The director suggested to set a mythical detail production norm. If at the beginning of the day there were x details in the factory storage, then by the end of the day the factory has to produce $x \\operatorname{mod} m$ (remainder after dividing x by m) more details. Unfortunately, no customer has ever bought any mythical detail, so all the details produced stay on the factory. \n\nThe board of directors are worried that the production by the given plan may eventually stop (that means that there will be \u0430 moment when the current number of details on the factory is divisible by m). \n\nGiven the number of details a on the first day and number m check if the production stops at some moment.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and m (1 \u2264 a, m \u2264 10^5).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes) if the production will eventually stop, otherwise print \"No\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 5\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n3 6\n\nOutput\nYes\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
