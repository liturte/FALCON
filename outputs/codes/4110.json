Note that this objective is always achievable (see Constraints).\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 700\n3 500\n5 800\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nIn this case, there are three problems each with 100 points and five problems each with 200 points. The perfect bonus for solving all the 100-point problems is 500 points, and the perfect bonus for solving all the 200-point problems is 800 points. Takahashi's objective is to have a total score of 700 points or more.\nOne way to achieve this objective is to solve four 200-point problems and earn a base score of 800 points. However, if we solve three 100-point problems, we can earn the perfect bonus of 500 points in addition to the base score of 300 points, for a total score of 800 points, and we can achieve the objective with fewer problems.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
