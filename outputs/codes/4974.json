One of these is to book hotel rooms in time, before all the rooms in town are booked. \n\nIn this problem, you should write a program to search for available rooms in a given hotel. The hotel has $r$ rooms, numbered from $1$ to $r$, and you will be given a list describing which of these rooms are already booked.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with two integers $r$ and $n$ ($1\\leq r \\leq 100$, $0 \\leq n \\le r$), the number of rooms in the hotel and the number of rooms that are already booked, respectively;\n - $n$ lines, each with an integer between $1$ and $r$ (inclusive), a room number that is already booked;\n\nAll $n$ room numbers of the already booked rooms are distinct.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there are available rooms, output the room number of any such room. Otherwise, output \u201ctoo late\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n100 5\n42\n3\n2\n99\n1\nSample Output:\n23\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
