Thus, each student will receive exactly one diploma.\n\nThey also decided that there must be given at least min_1 and at most max_1 diplomas of the first degree, at least min_2 and at most max_2 diplomas of the second degree, and at least min_3 and at most max_3 diplomas of the third degree.\n\nAfter some discussion it was decided to choose from all the options of distributing diplomas satisfying these limitations the one that maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the first degree. Of all these options they select the one which maximizes the number of the participants who receive diplomas of the second degree. If there are multiple of these options, they select the option that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree.\n\nChoosing the best option of distributing certificates was entrusted to Ilya, one of the best programmers of Berland. However, he found more important things to do, so it is your task now to choose the best option of distributing of diplomas, based on the described limitations.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the described limitations are such that there is a way to choose such an option of distributing diplomas that all n participants of the Olympiad will receive a diploma of some degree.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^6)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of schoolchildren who will participate in the Olympiad.\n\nThe next line of the input contains two integers min_1 and max_1 (1 \u2264 min_1 \u2264 max_1 \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the first degree that can be distributed.\n\nThe third line of the input contains two integers min_2 and max_2 (1 \u2264 min_2 \u2264 max_2 \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the second degree that can be distributed. \n\nThe next line of the input contains two integers min_3 and max_3 (1 \u2264 min_3 \u2264 max_3 \u2264 10^6)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the third degree that can be distributed. \n\nIt is guaranteed that min_1 + min_2 + min_3 \u2264 n \u2264 max_1 + max_2 + max_3.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line of the output print three numbers, showing how many diplomas of the first, second and third degree will be given to students in the optimal variant of distributing diplomas.\n\nThe optimal variant of distributing diplomas is the one that maximizes the number of students who receive diplomas of the first degree. Of all the suitable options, the best one is the one which maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the second degree. If there are several of these options, the best one is the one that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 5\n2 6\n3 7\n\nOutput\n1 2 3 \n\nInput\n10\n1 2\n1 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\n2 3 5 \n\nInput\n6\n1 3\n2 2\n2 2\n\nOutput\n2 2 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
