Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $|x|$ and $|y|$ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $|x - y|$ and $|x + y|$ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.\n\nHere $|z|$ denotes the absolute value of $z$.\n\nNow, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $x$ and $y$?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$. Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these $n$ integers such that the legend could be true if $x$ and $y$ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of choices.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the choices Jose is considering.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer number\u00a0\u2014 the number of unordered pairs $\\{x, y\\}$ formed by different numbers from Jose's choices that could make the legend true.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 5 -3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n3 6\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first sample. For the pair $\\{2, 5\\}$, the situation looks as follows, with the Arrayland markers at $|2| = 2$ and $|5| = 5$, while the Vectorland markers are located at $|2 - 5| = 3$ and $|2 + 5| = 7$:\n\n [Image] \n\nThe legend is not true in this case, because the interval $[2, 3]$ is not conquered by Vectorland. For the pair $\\{5, -3\\}$ the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval $[3, 5]$ and Vectorland consisting of the interval $[2, 8]$:\n\n [Image] \n\nAs Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair $\\{2, -3\\}$, for a total of two pairs.\n\nIn the second sample, the only pair is $\\{3, 6\\}$, and the situation looks as follows:\n\n [Image] \n\nNote that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share $3$ as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
