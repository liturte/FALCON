You can choose any integer $k \\ge 0$, calculate the expression $s_k = f(x) + f(y) \\cdot 2^k$ and write the binary representation of $s_k$ in reverse order (let's denote it as $rev_k$). For example, let $x = 1010$ and $y = 11$; you've chosen $k = 1$ and, since $2^1 = 10_2$, so $s_k = 1010_2 + 11_2 \\cdot 10_2 = 10000_2$ and $rev_k = 00001$.\n\nFor given $x$ and $y$, you need to choose such $k$ that $rev_k$ is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don't know what does \"lexicographically\" means).\n\nIt's guaranteed that, with given constraints, $k$ exists and is finite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext $2T$ lines contain a description of queries: two lines per query. The first line contains one binary string $x$, consisting of no more than $10^5$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.\n\nThe second line contains one binary string $y$, consisting of no more than $10^5$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.\n\nIt's guaranteed, that $1 \\le f(y) \\le f(x)$ (where $f(x)$ is the integer represented by $x$, and $f(y)$ is the integer represented by $y$), both representations don't have any leading zeroes, the total length of $x$ over all queries doesn't exceed $10^5$, and the total length of $y$ over all queries doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ integers (one per query). For each query print such $k$ that $rev_k$ is lexicographically minimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1010\n11\n10001\n110\n1\n1\n1010101010101\n11110000\n\nOutput\n1\n3\n0\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first query was described in the legend.\n\nIn the second query, it's optimal to choose $k = 3$. The $2^3 = 1000_2$ so $s_3 = 10001_2 + 110_2 \\cdot 1000_2 = 10001 + 110000 = 1000001$ and $rev_3 = 1000001$. For example, if $k = 0$, then $s_0 = 10111$ and $rev_0 = 11101$, but $rev_3 = 1000001$ is lexicographically smaller than $rev_0 = 11101$.\n\nIn the third query $s_0 = 10$ and $rev_0 = 01$. For example, $s_2 = 101$ and $rev_2 = 101$. And $01$ is lexicographically smaller than $101$.\n\nThe quote from Wikipedia: \"To determine which of two strings of characters comes when arranging in lexicographical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.\"\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
