The height of the $i$-th person is $a_i$. You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.\n\nA balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than $1$. For example, let heights of chosen people be $[a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}]$, where $k$ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $|a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \\le 1$ should be satisfied for all $j$ from $1$ to $k-1$ and the condition $|a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \\le 1$ should be also satisfied. $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.\n\nYour task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of people.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the height of the $i$-th person.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line of the output print $k$ \u2014 the number of people in the maximum balanced circle.\n\nIn the second line print $k$ integers $res_1, res_2, \\dots, res_k$, where $res_j$ is the height of the $j$-th person in the maximum balanced circle. The condition $|res_{j} - res_{j + 1}| \\le 1$ should be satisfied for all $j$ from $1$ to $k-1$ and the condition $|res_{1} - res_{k}| \\le 1$ should be also satisfied.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n4 3 5 1 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n5\n2 1 1 2 3\n\nInput\n5\n3 7 5 1 5\n\nOutput\n2\n5 5 \n\nInput\n3\n5 1 4\n\nOutput\n2\n4 5 \n\nInput\n7\n2 2 3 2 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n7\n1 2 2 2 2 3 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
