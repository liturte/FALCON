You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.\n\nKirk has a binary string $s$ (a string which consists of zeroes and ones) of length $n$ and he is asking you to find a binary string $t$ of the same length which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n\n\n For any $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$) the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r}$ is equal to the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $t_{l}t_{l+1} \\ldots t_{r}$;\n\n The number of zeroes in $t$ is the maximum possible.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence of a string $p$ is a sequence of indices $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ such that $i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k$ and $p_{i_1} \\leq p_{i_2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq p_{i_k}$. The length of the subsequence is $k$.\n\nIf there are multiple substrings which satisfy the conditions, output any.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a binary string of length not more than $2\\: 000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a binary string which satisfied the above conditions.
