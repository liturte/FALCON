He has n books numbered by integers from 1 to n. The weight of the i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) book is w_{i}.\n\nAs Jaehyun's house is not large enough to have a bookshelf, he keeps the n books by stacking them vertically. When he wants to read a certain book x, he follows the steps described below.  He lifts all the books above book x.  He pushes book x out of the stack.  He puts down the lifted books without changing their order.  After reading book x, he puts book x on the top of the stack. \n\n[Image] \n\nHe decided to read books for m days. In the j-th (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) day, he will read the book that is numbered with integer b_{j} (1 \u2264 b_{j} \u2264 n). To read the book, he has to use the process described in the paragraph above. It is possible that he decides to re-read the same book several times.\n\nAfter making this plan, he realized that the total weight of books he should lift during m days would be too heavy. So, he decided to change the order of the stacked books before the New Year comes, and minimize the total weight. You may assume that books can be stacked in any possible order. Note that book that he is going to read on certain step isn't considered as lifted on that step. Can you help him?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of books, and the number of days for which Jaehyun would read books.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n} (1 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the weight of each book.\n\nThe third line contains m space separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 \u2264 b_{j} \u2264 n) \u2014 the order of books that he would read. Note that he can read the same book more than once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum total weight of books he should lift, which can be achieved by rearranging the order of stacked books.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n1 2 3\n1 3 2 3 1\n\nOutput\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nHere's a picture depicting the example.
