Today he wants to solve $(x~\\mathrm{div}~k) \\cdot (x \\bmod k) = n$, where $\\mathrm{div}$ and $\\mathrm{mod}$ stand for integer division and modulo operations (refer to the Notes below for exact definition). In this equation, $k$ and $n$ are positive integer parameters, and $x$ is a positive integer unknown. If there are several solutions, Vasya wants to find the smallest possible $x$. Can you help him?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$, $2 \\leq k \\leq 1000$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer $x$\u00a0\u2014 the smallest positive integer solution to $(x~\\mathrm{div}~k) \\cdot (x \\bmod k) = n$. It is guaranteed that this equation has at least one positive integer solution.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 3\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n1 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe result of integer division $a~\\mathrm{div}~b$ is equal to the largest integer $c$ such that $b \\cdot c \\leq a$. $a$ modulo $b$ (shortened $a \\bmod b$) is the only integer $c$ such that $0 \\leq c < b$, and $a - c$ is divisible by $b$.\n\nIn the first sample, $11~\\mathrm{div}~3 = 3$ and $11 \\bmod 3 = 2$. Since $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, then $x = 11$ is a solution to $(x~\\mathrm{div}~3) \\cdot (x \\bmod 3) = 6$. One can see that $19$ is the only other positive integer solution, hence $11$ is the smallest one.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
