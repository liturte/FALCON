They want to try out a new fancy restaurant and they decided to make a bet \u2013 they are going to play a game and the loser pays for dinner.\n\nThey have a box with $N$ balls. Each ball contains a distinct number between $1$ and $N$. Then, the game proceeds with these steps:\n - Initially, each person picks $C$ distinct numbers between $1$ and $N$ and writes them down on a separate card.\n - In each round, $D$ balls are drawn from the box uniformly at random. Cesar and Raul mark the ball numbers that appear on their respective card. The $D$ balls are then returned to the box.\n - The game stops when a player has marked all the numbers he chose. That player is the winner. If both players finish at the same time, it is a draw and they will split the dinner.\n\nThey are quite eager to try out this new restaurant and they\u2019re now wondering: how many rounds will the game last until at least one of the players has marked all his numbers?\n\n-----Task-----\nGiven the number $N$ of balls, the number $D$ of balls they draw from the box in each round, the amount $C$ of numbers in their cards and the numbers they wrote down, find the expected number of rounds the game will last.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input consists of three space separated integers: $N$, $D$, and $C$. $N$ is the number of balls, $D$ is the number of balls drawn in each round, and $C$ is the cards\u2019 size. Each of the following two lines contains $C$ space separated integers: the numbers Cesar and Raul wrote down, respectively.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\n$1$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$N$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$50$\n\nNumber of balls in the box\n\n$1$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$D$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$\\min (10, N)$\n\nNumber of balls drawn in each round\n\n$1$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$C$\n\n$\\leq $\n\n$\\min (10, N)$\n\nCards\u2019 sizeOutput\n\nThe output is the expected number of rounds of the game.\n\nThe result will be considered correct as long as the absolute error does not exceed $10^{-3}$.\n\n-----Explanation for Sample Input 1-----\nThere are $2$ balls. Cesar picked number $1$ and Raul picked number $2$. In the first round, either number $1$ or $2$ will be drawn and so one of them wins right away.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 1 1\n1\n2\nSample Output:\n1.00000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
