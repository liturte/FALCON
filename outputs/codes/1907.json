Once someone starts moving around, they will move only inside their own movement range, which is a circular area C_{i} described by a center (x_{i}, y_{i}) and a radius r_{i}. No two ranges' borders have more than one common point, that is for every pair (i, j) (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n) either ranges C_{i} and C_{j} are disjoint, or one of them is a subset of the other. Note that it's possible that two ranges' borders share a single common point, but no two dancers have exactly the same ranges.\n\nTsukihi, being one of them, defines the spaciousness to be the area covered by an odd number of movement ranges of dancers who are moving. An example is shown below, with shaded regions representing the spaciousness if everyone moves at the same time. [Image] \n\nBut no one keeps moving for the whole night after all, so the whole night's time is divided into two halves \u2014 before midnight and after midnight. Every dancer moves around in one half, while sitting down with friends in the other. The spaciousness of two halves are calculated separately and their sum should, of course, be as large as possible. The following figure shows an optimal solution to the example above. [Image] \n\nBy different plans of who dances in the first half and who does in the other, different sums of spaciousness over two halves are achieved. You are to find the largest achievable value of this sum.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of dancers.\n\nThe following n lines each describes a dancer: the i-th line among them contains three space-separated integers x_{i}, y_{i} and r_{i} ( - 10^6 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 10^6), describing a circular movement range centered at (x_{i}, y_{i}) with radius r_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one decimal number \u2014 the largest achievable sum of spaciousness over two halves of the night.\n\nThe output is considered correct if it has a relative or absolute error of at most 10^{ - 9}. Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \\leq 10^{-9}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 1 6\n0 4 1\n2 -1 3\n1 -2 1\n4 -1 1\n\nOutput\n138.23007676\n\nInput\n8\n0 0 1\n0 0 2\n0 0 3\n0 0 4\n0 0 5\n0 0 6\n0 0 7\n0 0 8\n\nOutput\n289.02652413\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first sample corresponds to the illustrations in the legend.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
