At each moment of time the height of the potato in the processor doesn't exceed h and the processor smashes k centimeters of potato each second. If there are less than k centimeters remaining, than during this second processor smashes all the remaining potato.\n\nVanya has n pieces of potato, the height of the i-th piece is equal to a_{i}. He puts them in the food processor one by one starting from the piece number 1 and finishing with piece number n. Formally, each second the following happens:\n\n  If there is at least one piece of potato remaining, Vanya puts them in the processor one by one, until there is not enough space for the next piece.  Processor smashes k centimeters of potato (or just everything that is inside). \n\nProvided the information about the parameter of the food processor and the size of each potato in a row, compute how long will it take for all the potato to become smashed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers n, h and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 h \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces of potato, the height of the food processor and the amount of potato being smashed each second, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 h)\u00a0\u2014 the heights of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of seconds required to smash all the potatoes following the process described in the problem statement.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6 3\n5 4 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n5 6 3\n5 5 5 5 5\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n5 6 3\n1 2 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first sample.   First Vanya puts the piece of potato of height 5 into processor. At the end of the second there is only amount of height 2 remaining inside.  Now Vanya puts the piece of potato of height 4. At the end of the second there is amount of height 3 remaining.  Vanya puts the piece of height 3 inside and again there are only 3 centimeters remaining at the end of this second.  Vanya finally puts the pieces of height 2 and 1 inside. At the end of the second the height of potato in the processor is equal to 3.  During this second processor finally smashes all the remaining potato and the process finishes. \n\nIn the second sample, Vanya puts the piece of height 5 inside and waits for 2 seconds while it is completely smashed. Then he repeats the same process for 4 other pieces. The total time is equal to 2\u00b75 = 10 seconds.\n\nIn the third sample, Vanya simply puts all the potato inside the processor and waits 2 seconds.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
