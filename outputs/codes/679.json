Kanno marvels at all the blonde colours along the riverside\u00a0\u2014 not tangerines, but blossoms instead.\n\n\"What a pity it's already late spring,\" sighs Mino with regret, \"one more drizzling night and they'd be gone.\"\n\n\"But these blends are at their best, aren't they?\" Absorbed in the landscape, Kanno remains optimistic. \n\nThe landscape can be expressed as a row of consecutive cells, each of which either contains a flower of colour amber or buff or canary yellow, or is empty.\n\nWhen a flower withers, it disappears from the cell that it originally belonged to, and it spreads petals of its colour in its two neighbouring cells (or outside the field if the cell is on the side of the landscape). In case petals fall outside the given cells, they simply become invisible.\n\nYou are to help Kanno determine whether it's possible that after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals, at least one of the cells contains all three colours, considering both petals and flowers. Note that flowers can wither in arbitrary order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a non-empty string $s$ consisting of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.' (dots) only ($\\lvert s \\rvert \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 denoting cells containing an amber flower, a buff one, a canary yellow one, and no flowers, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput \"Yes\" if it's possible that all three colours appear in some cell, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n.BAC.\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\nAA..CB\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the buff and canary yellow flowers can leave their petals in the central cell, blending all three colours in it.\n\nIn the second example, it's impossible to satisfy the requirement because there is no way that amber and buff meet in any cell.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
