[Image] \n\nThe game is played as follows. In each level, you have a grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell originally contains the number 0.\n\nOne move consists of choosing one row or column, and adding 1 to all of the cells in that row or column.\n\nTo win the level, after all the moves, the number in the cell at the i-th row and j-th column should be equal to g_{i}, j.\n\nKaren is stuck on one level, and wants to know a way to beat this level using the minimum number of moves. Please, help her with this task!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers, n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100), the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, respectively.\n\nThe next n lines each contain m integers. In particular, the j-th integer in the i-th of these rows contains g_{i}, j (0 \u2264 g_{i}, j \u2264 500).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is an error and it is actually not possible to beat the level, output a single integer -1.\n\nOtherwise, on the first line, output a single integer k, the minimum number of moves necessary to beat the level.\n\nThe next k lines should each contain one of the following, describing the moves in the order they must be done:  row x, (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) describing a move of the form \"choose the x-th row\".  col x, (1 \u2264 x \u2264 m) describing a move of the form \"choose the x-th column\". \n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, output any one of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n2 2 2 3 2\n0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n4\nrow 1\nrow 1\ncol 4\nrow 3\n\nInput\n3 3\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\nrow 1\nrow 2\nrow 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 5 columns. She can perform the following 4 moves to beat the level: [Image] \n\nIn the second test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. It is clear that it is impossible to beat the level; performing any move will create three 1s on the grid, but it is required to only have one 1 in the center.\n\nIn the third test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. She can perform the following 3 moves to beat the level: [Image] \n\nNote that this is not the only solution; another solution, among others, is col 1, col 2, col 3.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
