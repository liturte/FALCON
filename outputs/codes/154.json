The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.\n\nThe depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is $0$.\n\nLet's call a binary search tree perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.\n\nLet's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex $v$:   If $v$ has a left subtree whose root is $u$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is different from the parity of the key of $u$.  If $v$ has a right subtree whose root is $w$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is the same as the parity of the key of $w$. \n\nYou are given a single integer $n$.
