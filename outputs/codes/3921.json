She also has preferences of integers. She thinks n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are good.\n\nNow she is interested in good sequences. A sequence x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. x_{i} < x_{i} + 1 for each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. gcd(x_{i}, x_{i} + 1) > 1 for each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k - 1) (where gcd(p, q) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers p and q).  All elements of the sequence are good integers. \n\nFind the length of the longest good sequence.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of good integers.
