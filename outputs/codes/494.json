Children's numbers in clockwise order form a permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n. It is an integer sequence such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.\n\nThe game consists of m steps. On each step the current leader with index i counts out a_{i} people in clockwise order, starting from the next person. The last one to be pointed at by the leader becomes the new leader.\n\nYou are given numbers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} \u2014 indices of leaders in the beginning of each step. Child with number l_1 is the first leader in the game. \n\nWrite a program which will restore a possible permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. If there are multiple solutions then print any of them. If there is no solution then print -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100).\n\nThe second line contains m integer numbers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 indices of leaders in the beginning of each step.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint such permutation of n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} that leaders in the game will be exactly l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} if all the rules are followed. If there are multiple solutions print any of them. \n\nIf there is no permutation which satisfies all described conditions print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n2 3 1 4 4\n\nOutput\n3 1 2 4 \n\nInput\n3 3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's follow leadership in the first example:   Child 2 starts.  Leadership goes from 2 to 2 + a_2 = 3.  Leadership goes from 3 to 3 + a_3 = 5. As it's greater than 4, it's going in a circle to 1.  Leadership goes from 1 to 1 + a_1 = 4.  Leadership goes from 4 to 4 + a_4 = 8. Thus in circle it still remains at 4.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
