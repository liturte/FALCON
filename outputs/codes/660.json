The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.\n\nThe tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):  let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k \u2264 m,  k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly,  when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. \n\nEach match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.\n\nFind the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.\n\nNote that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 \u2264 n, b, p \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers x and y \u2014 the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 3\n\nOutput\n20 15\n\nInput\n8 2 4\n\nOutput\n35 32\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example will be three rounds:  in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge),  in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water,  in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. \n\nSo in total we need 20 bottles of water.\n\nIn the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
