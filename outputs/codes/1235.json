However, we can't choose $2$ from $A$ and $1$ from $B$, as $3 = 2 + 1$ belongs to $B$.\n\nIt can be shown that such a pair exists.

Number $40 = 20 + 20$ doesn't belong to any of those arrays. However, it is possible to choose $10$ from the second array too.\n\nIn the second example, we can choose $3$ from array $[3, 2, 2]$ and $1$ from array $[1, 5, 7, 7, 9]$. Number $4 = 3 + 1$ doesn't belong to any of those arrays.\n\nIn the third example, we can choose $1$ from array $[1, 3, 5, 7]$ and $1$ from array $[7, 5, 3, 1]$. Number $2 = 1 + 1$ doesn't belong to any of those arrays.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
