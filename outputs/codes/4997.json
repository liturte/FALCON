He then swaps two cups in one of three possible ways a number of times. Mirko has to tell which cup the ball ends up under.\n\nWise Mirko grins with his arms crossed while Borko struggles to move the cups faster and faster. What Borko does not know is that programmers in the back are recording all his moves and will use a simple program to determine where the ball is. Write that program.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line contains a non-empty string of at most $50$ characters, Borko\u2019s moves. Each of the characters is \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018C\u2019 (without quote marks).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the index of the cup under which the ball is: $1$ if it is under the left cup, $2$ if it is under the middle cup or $3$ if it is under the right cup.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\nAB\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
