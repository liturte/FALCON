To get his first Pokemon, he went to Professor Zulu's Lab. Since Bash is Professor Zulu's favourite student, Zulu allows him to take as many Pokemon from his lab as he pleases.\n\nBut Zulu warns him that a group of k > 1 Pokemon with strengths {s_1, s_2, s_3, ..., s_{k}} tend to fight among each other if gcd(s_1, s_2, s_3, ..., s_{k}) = 1 (see notes for gcd definition).\n\nBash, being smart, does not want his Pokemon to fight among each other. However, he also wants to maximize the number of Pokemon he takes from the lab. Can you help Bash find out the maximum number of Pokemon he can take? \n\nNote: A Pokemon cannot fight with itself.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of two lines.\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of Pokemon in the lab.\n\nThe next line contains n space separated integers, where the i-th of them denotes s_{i} (1 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 10^5), the strength of the i-th Pokemon.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of Pokemons Bash can take.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n2 3 4 6 7\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\ngcd (greatest common divisor) of positive integers set {a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}} is the maximum positive integer that divides all the integers {a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}}.\n\nIn the first sample, we can take Pokemons with strengths {2, 4} since gcd(2, 4) = 2.\n\nIn the second sample, we can take Pokemons with strengths {2, 4, 6}, and there is no larger group with gcd \u2260 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
