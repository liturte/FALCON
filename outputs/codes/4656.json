The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet (\"a\"\u2013\"z\"). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.\n\nA necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.\n\nFor example, if the store sells beads \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\", \"c\", \"c\", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options): [Image] \n\nAnd the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store: [Image] The first necklace cannot be assembled because it has three beads \"a\" (of the two available). The second necklace cannot be assembled because it contains a bead \"d\", which is not sold in the store. \n\nWe call a necklace $k$-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by $k$ beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace.  [Image]  As you can see, this necklace is, for example, $3$-beautiful, $6$-beautiful, $9$-beautiful, and so on, but it is not $1$-beautiful or $2$-beautiful.\n\nIn particular, a necklace of length $1$ is $k$-beautiful for any integer $k$. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any $k$.\n\nYou are given the integers $n$ and $k$, and also the string $s$ containing $n$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet\u00a0\u2014 each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a $k$-beautiful necklace you can assemble.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 2000$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $s$ containing $n$ lowercase English letters\u00a0\u2014 the beads in the store.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $t$ answers to the test cases. Each answer is a positive integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum length of the $k$-beautiful necklace you can assemble.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n6 3\nabcbac\n3 6\naaa\n7 1000\nabczgyo\n5 4\nababa\n20 10\naaebdbabdbbddaadaadc\n20 5\necbedececacbcbccbdec\n\nOutput\n6\n3\n5\n4\n15\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case is explained in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case, a $6$-beautiful necklace can be assembled from all the letters.\n\nIn the third test case, a $1000$-beautiful necklace can be assembled, for example, from beads \"abzyo\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
