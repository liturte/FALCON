Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.\n\nLittle Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.\n\nA wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3), denoting the number of circles.\n\nThe following n lines each contains three space-separated integers x, y and r ( - 10 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 10), describing a circle whose center is (x, y) and the radius is r. No two circles have the same x, y and r at the same time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of regions on the plane.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n0 0 1\n2 0 1\n4 0 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3\n0 0 2\n3 0 2\n6 0 2\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n3\n0 0 2\n2 0 2\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example, $000$ \n\nFor the second example, [Image] \n\nFor the third example, $\\text{Q)}$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
