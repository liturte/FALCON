As a best engineer of the company he was assigned a task to develop a printer that will be able to print horizontal and vertical strips. First prototype is already built and Kris wants to tests it. He wants you to implement the program that checks the result of the printing.\n\nPrinter works with a rectangular sheet of paper of size n \u00d7 m. Consider the list as a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Rows are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m. Initially, all cells are painted in color 0.\n\nYour program has to support two operations:   Paint all cells in row r_{i} in color a_{i};  Paint all cells in column c_{i} in color a_{i}. \n\nIf during some operation i there is a cell that have already been painted, the color of this cell also changes to a_{i}.\n\nYour program has to print the resulting table after k operation.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1  \u2264  n,  m  \u2264 5000, n\u00b7m \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations, respectively.\n\nEach of the next k lines contains the description of exactly one query:   1\u00a0r_{i}\u00a0a_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), means that row r_{i} is painted in color a_{i};  2\u00a0c_{i}\u00a0a_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), means that column c_{i} is painted in color a_{i}. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n lines containing m integers each\u00a0\u2014 the resulting table after all operations are applied.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 3\n1 1 3\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n\nOutput\n3 1 3 \n2 2 2 \n0 1 0 \n\nInput\n5 3 5\n1 1 1\n1 3 1\n1 5 1\n2 1 1\n2 3 1\n\nOutput\n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe figure below shows all three operations for the first sample step by step. The cells that were painted on the corresponding step are marked gray.  [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
