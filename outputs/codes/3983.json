It is guaranteed that G is initially a good graph.\n - Vertex 1 and Vertex N are not connected.\n - There are no self-loops and no multi-edges.\nTaro the first and Jiro the second will play a game against each other.\nThey will alternately take turns, with Taro the first going first.\nIn each player's turn, the player can do the following operation:\n - Operation: Choose vertices u and v, then add to G an edge connecting u and v bidirectionally.\nThe player whose addition of an edge results in G being no longer a good graph loses. Determine the winner of the game when the two players play optimally.\nYou are given T test cases.

Below is one sequence of moves that results in Taro's win:\n - In Taro the first's turn, he adds an edge connecting Vertex 1 and 2, after which the graph is still good.\n - Then, whichever two vertices Jiro the second would choose to connect with an edge, the graph would no longer be good.\n - Thus, Taro wins.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
