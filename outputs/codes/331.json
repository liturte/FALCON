There are n houses in that village, lining in a straight line from left to right: house 1, house 2, ..., house n. The village is also well-structured: house i and house i + 1 (1 \u2264 i < n) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.\n\nYou will be given n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house i is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then a_{i} equals 0. Otherwise, house i can be bought, and a_{i} represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.\n\nAs Zane has only k dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush. Help Zane determine the minimum distance from his crush's house to some house he can afford, to help him succeed in his love.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of houses in the village, the house where the girl lives, and the amount of money Zane has (in dollars), respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 denoting the availability and the prices of the houses.\n\nIt is guaranteed that a_{m} = 0 and that it is possible to purchase some house with no more than k dollars.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum distance, in meters, from the house where the girl Zane likes lives to the house Zane can buy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1 20\n0 27 32 21 19\n\nOutput\n40\nInput\n7 3 50\n62 0 0 0 99 33 22\n\nOutput\n30\nInput\n10 5 100\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, with k = 20 dollars, Zane can buy only house 5. The distance from house m = 1 to house 5 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 meters.\n\nIn the second sample, Zane can buy houses 6 and 7. It is better to buy house 6 than house 7, since house m = 3 and house 6 are only 30 meters away, while house m = 3 and house 7 are 40 meters away.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
