You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t \u2014 the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w \u2014 the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.\n\nTwo ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.\n\nSince Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ($3 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}, 0 \\leq m \\leq \\operatorname{min}(\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}, 10^{5})$\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.\n\nNext m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n4 2\n4 3\n\nOutput\n1 2\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\nOutput\n0 1\n\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n3 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
