(Janken is the Japanese name for Rock-paper-scissors.)N players will participate in this competition, and they are given distinct integers from 1 through N.\nThe arena has M playing fields for two players. You need to assign each playing field two distinct integers between 1 and N (inclusive).\nYou cannot assign the same integer to multiple playing fields.\nThe competition consists of N rounds, each of which proceeds as follows:\n - For each player, if there is a playing field that is assigned the player's integer, the player goes to that field and fight the other player who comes there.\n - Then, each player adds 1 to its integer. If it becomes N+1, change it to 1.\nYou want to ensure that no player fights the same opponent more than once during the N rounds.\nPrint an assignment of integers to the playing fields satisfying this condition.\nIt can be proved that such an assignment always exists under the constraints given.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq M\n - M \\times 2 +1 \\leq N \\leq 200000\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint M lines in the format below.\nThe i-th line should contain the two integers a_i and b_i assigned to the i-th playing field.\na_1 b_1\na_2 b_2\n:\na_M b_M\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2 3\n\nLet us call the four players A, B, C, and D, and assume that they are initially given the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n - The 1-st round is fought by B and C, who has the integers 2 and 3, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers 2, 3, 4, and 1, respectively.\n - The 2-nd round is fought by A and B, who has the integers 2 and 3, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers 3, 4, 1, and 2, respectively.\n - The 3-rd round is fought by D and A, who has the integers 2 and 3, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers 4, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n - The 4-th round is fought by C and D, who has the integers 2 and 3, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\nNo player fights the same opponent more than once during the four rounds, so this solution will be accepted.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
