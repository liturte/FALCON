(You can also choose to leave Vertex N without pressing the button and continue traveling.)\nHowever, when you end the game, you will be asked to pay T \\times P coins, where T is the number of minutes elapsed since the start of the game. If you have less than T \\times P coins, you will have to pay all of your coins instead.\nYour score will be the number of coins you have after this payment.\nDetermine if there exists a maximum value of the score that can be obtained. If the answer is yes, find that maximum value.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 2500\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 5000\n - 1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq N\n - 1 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^5\n - 0 \\leq P \\leq 10^5\n - All values in input are integers.\n - Vertex N can be reached from Vertex 1.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M P\nA_1 B_1 C_1\n:\nA_M B_M C_M\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there exists a maximum value of the score that can be obtained, print that maximum value; otherwise, print -1.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 3 10\n1 2 20\n2 3 30\n1 3 45\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n35\n\n\nThere are two ways to travel from Vertex 1 to Vertex 3:\n - Vertex 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3: You collect 20 + 30 = 50 coins on the way.

After one minute from the start of the game, you press the button, pay 1 \\times 10 = 10 coins, and you have 45 - 10 = 35 coins left.\nThus, the maximum score that can be obtained is 35.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
