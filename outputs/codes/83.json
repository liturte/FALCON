Your task is to find some non-zero integer $d$ ($-10^3 \\leq d \\leq 10^3$) such that, after each number in the array is divided by $d$, the number of positive numbers that are presented in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size (i.e., at least $\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$). Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a $2.5$ counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.\n\nRecall that $\\lceil x \\rceil$ represents the smallest integer that is not less than $x$ and that zero ($0$) is neither positive nor negative.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^3 \\le a_i \\le 10^3$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer $d$ ($-10^3 \\leq d \\leq 10^3$ and $d \\neq 0$) that satisfies the given condition.

If $d = 4$, the array after division is $[2.5, 0, -1.75, 0.5, 1.5]$, in which there are $3$ positive numbers (namely: $2.5$, $0.5$, and $1.5$).\n\nIn the second sample, there is no valid $d$, so $0$ should be printed.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
