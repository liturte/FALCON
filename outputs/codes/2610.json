The only difference is the constraint on $k$ \u2014 the number of gifts in the offer. In this version: $2 \\le k \\le n$.\n\nVasya came to the store to buy goods for his friends for the New Year. It turned out that he was very lucky\u00a0\u2014 today the offer \"$k$ of goods for the price of one\" is held in store.\n\nUsing this offer, Vasya can buy exactly $k$ of any goods, paying only for the most expensive of them. Vasya decided to take this opportunity and buy as many goods as possible for his friends with the money he has.\n\nMore formally, for each good, its price is determined by $a_i$\u00a0\u2014 the number of coins it costs. Initially, Vasya has $p$ coins. He wants to buy the maximum number of goods. Vasya can perform one of the following operations as many times as necessary:\n\n  Vasya can buy one good with the index $i$ if he currently has enough coins (i.e $p \\ge a_i$). After buying this good, the number of Vasya's coins will decrease by $a_i$, (i.e it becomes $p := p - a_i$).  Vasya can buy a good with the index $i$, and also choose exactly $k-1$ goods, the price of which does not exceed $a_i$, if he currently has enough coins (i.e $p \\ge a_i$). Thus, he buys all these $k$ goods, and his number of coins decreases by $a_i$ (i.e it becomes $p := p - a_i$). \n\nPlease note that each good can be bought no more than once.\n\nFor example, if the store now has $n=5$ goods worth $a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=3, a_4=5, a_5=7$, respectively, $k=2$, and Vasya has $6$ coins, then he can buy $3$ goods. A good with the index $1$ will be bought by Vasya without using the offer and he will pay $2$ coins. Goods with the indices $2$ and $3$ Vasya will buy using the offer and he will pay $4$ coins. It can be proved that Vasya can not buy more goods with six coins.\n\nHelp Vasya to find out the maximum number of goods he can buy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nThe next lines contain a description of $t$ test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n, p, k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le p \\le 2\\cdot10^9$, $2 \\le k \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of goods in the store, the number of coins Vasya has and the number of goods that can be bought by the price of the most expensive of them.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the prices of goods.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case in a separate line print one integer $m$\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of goods that Vasya can buy.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n8\n5 6 2\n2 4 3 5 7\n5 11 2\n2 4 3 5 7\n3 2 3\n4 2 6\n5 2 3\n10 1 3 9 2\n2 10000 2\n10000 10000\n2 9999 2\n10000 10000\n4 6 4\n3 2 3 2\n5 5 3\n1 2 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n3\n4\n1\n1\n2\n0\n4\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
