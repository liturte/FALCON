In a math book he have found k permutations. Each of them consists of numbers 1, 2, ..., n in some order. Now he should find the length of the longest common subsequence of these permutations. Can you help Gargari?\n\nYou can read about longest common subsequence there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000;\u00a02 \u2264 k \u2264 5).
