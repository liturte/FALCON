At first, the first two players in the line play a game. Then the loser goes to the end of the line, and the winner plays with the next person from the line, and so on. They play until someone wins k games in a row. This player becomes the winner.\n\nFor each of the participants, you know the power to play table tennis, and for all players these values are different. In a game the player with greater power always wins. Determine who will be the winner.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers: n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 10^12)\u00a0\u2014 the number of people and the number of wins.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 powers of the player. It's guaranteed that this line contains a valid permutation, i.e. all a_{i} are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 power of the winner.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n2 \nInput\n4 2\n3 1 2 4\n\nOutput\n3 \nInput\n6 2\n6 5 3 1 2 4\n\nOutput\n6 \nInput\n2 10000000000\n2 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nGames in the second sample:\n\n3 plays with 1. 3 wins. 1 goes to the end of the line.\n\n3 plays with 2. 3 wins.
