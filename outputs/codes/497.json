The neighboring houses are $1$ and $2$, $2$ and $3$, ..., $n-1$ and $n$. The houses $n$ and $1$ are not neighboring.\n\nThe houses are colored in colors $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ so that the $i$-th house is colored in the color $c_i$. Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.\n\nIlya wants to select two houses $i$ and $j$ so that $1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$, and they have different colors: $c_i \\neq c_j$. He will then walk from the house $i$ to the house $j$ the distance of $(j-i)$ units.\n\nIlya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.\n\nHelp Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities on the street.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\leq c_i \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the colors of the houses.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one pair of indices $i$ and $j$ so that $1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$ and $c_i \\neq c_j$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible distance Ilya can walk.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 2 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7\n1 1 3 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the optimal way is to walk from the first house to the last one, where Ilya can walk the distance of $5-1 = 4$ units.\n\nIn the second example the optimal way is to either walk from the first house to the second or from the second to the third. Both these ways have the distance of $1$ unit.\n\nIn the third example the optimal way is to walk from the third house to the last one, where Ilya can walk the distance of $7-3 = 4$ units.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
