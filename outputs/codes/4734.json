The basic principle was to take an Apaxian name $Y$, add ex, and then the name $P$ of one of the parents. For example, if $Y$ is menolaxios and $P$ is mox, the extended name is $\\texttt{menolaxios}+\\texttt{ex}+\\texttt{mox}=\\texttt{menolaxiosexmox}$\n\nHowever, there were a few exceptions to this rule:\n - If $Y$ ends with e, then the extended name is $Y+\\texttt{x}+P$\n - If $Y$ ends with any other vowel (a,i,o, or u), we remove that final vowel from $Y$, and then extend $Y$ with $\\texttt{ex}+P$\n - If $Y$ already ends with ex, then the extended name is simply $Y+P$.\n\nAs usual, the Oriental Institute has asked us to help them apply the power of computation to generating these extended names.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains two strings separated by a single space: $Y$ and $P$, as defined above. Each string contains only lowercase English letters, and is at least $2$ characters long and at most $10$ characters long.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is a single string containing the extended name, as defined above.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nmenolaxios mox\nSample Output 1:\nmenolaxiosexmox\n\nSample Input 2:\nalemaxe maxos\nSample Output 2:\nalemaxexmaxos\n\nSample Input 3:\npamoli toxes\nSample Output 3:\npamolextoxes\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
