Each player has their own grid, which is hidden from their opponent. Each player secretly places some ships on their grid. Each ship covers a horizontal or vertical straight line of one or more contiguous squares. Ships cannot overlap. All ships are considered distinct, even if they have the same size. The orientation of each ship is not important to the game, only the squares they occupy.\n\nAfter placing their ships, the players then take turns taking shots at their opponent\u2019s ships by calling out a coordinate of their opponent\u2019s grid. The opponent must honestly say whether the shot was a hit or a miss. When all of a ship\u2019s squares are hit, that ship sinks (\u201cYou sunk my battleship!!\u201d). A player loses when all of their ships are sunk.\n\nBob is playing a game of Mini Battleship against Alice. Regular Battleship is played on a $10 \\! \\times \\! 10$ grid with $5$ ships. Mini Battleship is much smaller, with a grid no larger than $5 \\! \\times \\! 5$ and possibly fewer than $5$ ships.\n\nBob wonders how many ship placements are possible on Alice\u2019s board given what he knows so far. The answer will be $0$ if Alice is cheating! (Or, if the game setup isn\u2019t possible.)\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5$) and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 5$), which represent a game of Mini Battleship played on an $n \\! \\times \\! n$ grid with $k$ ships.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains a string $s$ ($|s|=n$). This is what Bob sees of Alice\u2019s grid so far.\n - A character \u2018X\u2019 represents one of Bob\u2019s shots that missed.\n - A character \u2018O\u2019 (Letter O, not zero) represents one of Bob\u2019s shots that hit.\n - A dot (\u2018.\u2019) represents a square where Bob has not yet taken a shot.\n\nEach of the next $k$ lines contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le n$). These are the sizes of the ships.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the number of ways the $k$ distinct ships could be placed on Alice\u2019s grid and be consistent with what Bob sees.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n....\n.OX.\n....\nO..X\n3\n2\n1\nSample Output 1:\n132\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n.X.X\n.XX.\n...X\n....\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSample Output 2:\n6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
