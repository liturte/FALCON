Each droid is described by m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, where a_{i} is the number of details of the i-th type in this droid's mechanism. R2-D2 wants to destroy the sequence of consecutive droids of maximum length. He has m weapons, the i-th weapon can affect all the droids in the army by destroying one detail of the i-th type (if the droid doesn't have details of this type, nothing happens to it). \n\nA droid is considered to be destroyed when all of its details are destroyed. R2-D2 can make at most k shots. How many shots from the weapon of what type should R2-D2 make to destroy the sequence of consecutive droids of maximum length?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of droids, the number of detail types and the number of available shots, respectively.\n\nNext n lines follow describing the droids. Each line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^8), where a_{i} is the number of details of the i-th type for the respective robot.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint m space-separated integers, where the i-th number is the number of shots from the weapon of the i-th type that the robot should make to destroy the subsequence of consecutive droids of the maximum length.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. \n\nIt is not necessary to make exactly k shots, the number of shots can be less.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 4\n4 0\n1 2\n2 1\n0 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n2 2\n\nInput\n3 2 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\n1 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test the second, third and fourth droids will be destroyed. \n\nIn the second test the first and second droids will be destroyed.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
