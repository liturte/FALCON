They first choose a starting number X_0 \u2265 3 and try to reach one million by the process described below. \n\nAlice goes first and then they take alternating turns. In the i-th turn, the player whose turn it is selects a prime number smaller than the current number, and announces the smallest multiple of this prime number that is not smaller than the current number.\n\nFormally, he or she selects a prime p < X_{i} - 1 and then finds the minimum X_{i} \u2265 X_{i} - 1 such that p divides X_{i}. Note that if the selected prime p already divides X_{i} - 1, then the number does not change.\n\nEve has witnessed the state of the game after two turns. Given X_2, help her determine what is the smallest possible starting number X_0. Note that the players don't necessarily play optimally. You should consider all possible game evolutions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains a single integer X_2 (4 \u2264 X_2 \u2264 10^6). It is guaranteed that the integer X_2 is composite, that is, is not prime.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible X_0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n14\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n20\n\nOutput\n15\n\nInput\n8192\n\nOutput\n8191\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, the smallest possible starting number is X_0 = 6. One possible course of the game is as follows:   Alice picks prime 5 and announces X_1 = 10  Bob picks prime 7 and announces X_2 = 14. \n\nIn the second case, let X_0 = 15.   Alice picks prime 2 and announces X_1 = 16  Bob picks prime 5 and announces X_2 = 20.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
