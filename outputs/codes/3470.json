Your task is to determine which of the $4n+4$ surrounding $1$-cells is guaranteed to not contain a mine. \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the rules of Minesweeper, here is a description:\n - Each of the red-labelled cells is either empty or contains a mine. All other cells are empty.\n - Each cell with a blue $1$ is adjacent to exactly one mine. Two cells are said to be adjacent if they share an edge or a corner. Thus, except at the border, every cell is adjacent to $8$ other cells.\n\nDetermine which of the red-labelled cells are safe, i.e., guaranteed to not contain a mine.\n\n-----Input-----\nAn integer $n$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$, the side length of the square. The image corresponds to $n = 6$.\n\nIt can be shown that there exists at least one valid placement of mines for each $n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFirst print the number $m$ of safe cells. Then print a line with $m$ integers, the indices of the safe cells in increasing order. The cells are indexed clockwise from $1$ to $4n+4$, starting at the bottom left corner, as shown in the image.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\nSample Output:\n8\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
