What is the lexicographically minimum possible string you can obtain from the given one if you can perform no more than $k$ moves? It is possible that you do not perform any moves at all.\n\nNote that you can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices $i$ and $i+1$ arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times. Each such swap is considered a separate move.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6, 1 \\le k \\le n^2$) \u2014 the length of the string and the number of moves you can perform.\n\nThe second line of the test case contains one string consisting of $n$ characters '0' and '1'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ($\\sum n \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer on it: the lexicographically minimum possible string of length $n$ you can obtain from the given one if you can perform no more than $k$ moves.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n8 5\n11011010\n7 9\n1111100\n7 11\n1111100\n\nOutput\n01011110\n0101111\n0011111\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can change the string as follows: $1\\underline{10}11010 \\rightarrow \\underline{10}111010 \\rightarrow 0111\\underline{10}10 \\rightarrow 011\\underline{10}110 \\rightarrow 01\\underline{10}1110 \\rightarrow 01011110$. \n\nIn the third example, there are enough operations to make the string sorted.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
