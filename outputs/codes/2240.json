A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal $s$ towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response $t$ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $t$ is similar to $s$.\n\nThe original signal $s$ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $t$, however, does not look as easy as $s$, but the scientists don't give up! They represented $t$ as a sequence of English letters and say that $t$ is similar to $s$ if you can replace all zeros in $s$ with some string $r_0$ and all ones in $s$ with some other string $r_1$ and obtain $t$. The strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different and non-empty.\n\nPlease help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $r_0$ and $r_1$) that transform $s$ to $t$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a string $s$ ($2 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$) consisting of zeros and ones\u00a0\u2014 the original signal.\n\nThe second line contains a string $t$ ($1 \\le |t| \\le 10^6$) consisting of lowercase English letters only\u00a0\u2014 the received signal.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the string $s$ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs of strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ that transform $s$ to $t$.\n\nIn case there are no such pairs, print $0$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n01\naaaaaa\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n001\nkokokokotlin\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the possible pairs $(r_0, r_1)$ are as follows:  \"a\", \"aaaaa\"  \"aa\", \"aaaa\"  \"aaaa\", \"aa\"  \"aaaaa\", \"a\"  \n\nThe pair \"aaa\", \"aaa\" is not allowed, since $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different.\n\nIn the second example, the following pairs are possible:   \"ko\", \"kokotlin\"  \"koko\", \"tlin\"\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
