The numbers of candies are special if their arithmetic mean, their median and their range are all equal. By definition, for a set {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} (x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 x_3 \u2264 x_4) arithmetic mean is $\\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}}{4}$, median is $\\frac{x_{2} + x_{3}}{2}$ and range is x_4 - x_1. The arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer. It is well-known that if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a \"debugging field\" and codes in the field will have no bugs.\n\nFor example, 1, 1, 3, 3 is the example of 4 numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and range are all equal to 2.\n\nJeff has 4 special boxes of candies. However, something bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now there are only n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 4) boxes remaining. The i-th remaining box contains a_{i} candies.\n\nNow Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number of candies of the 4 - n missing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean, median and range are equal)?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains an only integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 4).\n\nThe next n lines contain integers a_{i}, denoting the number of candies in the i-th box (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 500).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first output line, print \"YES\" if a solution exists, or print \"NO\" if there is no solution.\n\nIf a solution exists, you should output 4 - n more lines, each line containing an integer b, denoting the number of candies in a missing box.\n\nAll your numbers b must satisfy inequality 1 \u2264 b \u2264 10^6. It is guaranteed that if there exists a positive integer solution, you can always find such b's meeting the condition. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nGiven numbers a_{i} may follow in any order in the input, not necessary in non-decreasing.\n\na_{i} may have stood at any positions in the original set, not necessary on lowest n first positions.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n3\n3\n\nInput\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4\n1\n2\n2\n3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, the numbers of candies in 4 boxes can be 1, 1, 3, 3. The arithmetic mean, the median and the range of them are all 2.\n\nFor the second sample, it's impossible to find the missing number of candies.\n\nIn the third example no box has been lost and numbers satisfy the condition.\n\nYou may output b in any order.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
