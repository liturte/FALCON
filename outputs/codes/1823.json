The festival will last for exactly n days and each day will have a premiere of exactly one film. Each film has a genre \u2014 an integer from 1 to k.\n\nOn the i-th day the festival will show a movie of genre a_{i}. We know that a movie of each of k genres occurs in the festival programme at least once. In other words, each integer from 1 to k occurs in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} at least once.\n\nValentine is a movie critic. He wants to watch some movies of the festival and then describe his impressions on his site.\n\nAs any creative person, Valentine is very susceptive. After he watched the movie of a certain genre, Valentine forms the mood he preserves until he watches the next movie. If the genre of the next movie is the same, it does not change Valentine's mood. If the genres are different, Valentine's mood changes according to the new genre and Valentine has a stress.\n\nValentine can't watch all n movies, so he decided to exclude from his to-watch list movies of one of the genres. In other words, Valentine is going to choose exactly one of the k genres and will skip all the movies of this genre. He is sure to visit other movies.\n\nValentine wants to choose such genre x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 k), that the total number of after-movie stresses (after all movies of genre x are excluded) were minimum.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), where n is the number of movies and k is the number of genres.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 k), where a_{i} is the genre of the i-th movie. It is guaranteed that each number from 1 to k occurs at least once in this sequence.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of the genre (from 1 to k) of the excluded films. If there are multiple answers, print the genre with the minimum number.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 3\n1 1 2 3 2 3 3 1 1 3\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 2 3 1 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample if we exclude the movies of the 1st genre, the genres 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3 remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 2nd genre, the genres 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3 remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 3rd genre the genres 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1 remain, that is 2 stresses.\n\nIn the second sample whatever genre Valentine excludes, he will have exactly 3 stresses.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
