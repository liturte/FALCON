If there are more than one such pair, find the leftmost (with the smallest indices of elements). If the two integers are equal to x, delete both and insert a single integer x + 1 on their place. This way the number of elements in the sequence is decreased by 1 on each step. \n\nYou stop performing the operation when there is no pair of equal consecutive elements.\n\nFor example, if the initial sequence is [5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2], then after the first operation you get [5, 2, 2, 2, 2], after the second \u2014 [5, 3, 2, 2], after the third \u2014 [5, 3, 3], and finally after the fourth you get [5, 4]. After that there are no equal consecutive elements left in the sequence, so you stop the process.\n\nDetermine the final sequence after you stop performing the operation.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single integer k \u2014 the number of elements in the sequence after you stop performing the operation. \n\nIn the second line print k integers\u00a0\u2014 the sequence after you stop performing the operation.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n5 2 1 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n2\n5 4 \nInput\n4\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutput\n1\n1000000002 \nInput\n7\n4 10 22 11 12 5 6\n\nOutput\n7\n4 10 22 11 12 5 6 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described in the statements.\n\nIn the second example the initial sequence is [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]. After the first operation the sequence is equal to [1000000001, 1000000000, 1000000000]. After the second operation the sequence is [1000000001, 1000000001]. After the third operation the sequence is [1000000002].\n\nIn the third example there are no two equal consecutive elements initially, so the sequence does not change.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
