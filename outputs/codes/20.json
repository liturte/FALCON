As you know, Karen loves palindromes, and she believes that it is good luck to wake up when the time is a palindrome.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome?\n\nRemember that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, 05:39 is not a palindrome, because 05:39 backwards is 93:50. On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00 \u2264  hh  \u2264 23, 00 \u2264  mm  \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n05:39\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n13:31\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n23:59\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11. She can wake up at 05:50, when the time is a palindrome.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen can wake up immediately, as the current time, 13:31, is already a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 1 minute. She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
