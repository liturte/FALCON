If he buys and reads it, his understanding level of the j-th algorithm will increase by A_{i,j} for each j (1\\leq j\\leq M).\nThere is no other way to increase the understanding levels of the algorithms.\nTakahashi's objective is to make his understanding levels of all the M algorithms X or higher. Determine whether this objective is achievable. If it is achievable, find the minimum amount of money needed to achieve it.\n\n\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
