She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.\n\nAn unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.\n\nAfter her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.\n\nNote that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.\n\nGiven the required information, find the maximum\u00a0number of chocolates Joty can get.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 \u2264 n, a, b, p, q \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer s \u2014 the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.\n\nNote that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 3 12 15\n\nOutput\n39\n\nInput\n20 2 3 3 5\n\nOutput\n51\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
