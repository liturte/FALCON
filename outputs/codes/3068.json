There are $26$ suspects, represented by cards with a single letter from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018Z\u2019. Suspect cards are shuffled and three are secretly set aside; these form the Black Vienna circle. The remaining $23$ cards are distributed between the two players. Note that players will necessarily get a different number of cards; one player may even get all $23$ cards while the other gets none.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to deduce which of the suspects are in the Black Vienna circle using player\u2019s replies to investigations; each investigation consists of a pair of suspects and the player\u2019s reply is the number of those suspects that are in his/her hand. Using several investigations it is possible to narrow which suspects can be in the Black Vienna circle (i.e., those that are not in any of the player\u2019s hands).\n\n-----Task-----\nWrite a program that reads a sequence of investigation replies and counts the number of admissible solutions, i.e.\u00a0possible sets of three suspects representing the members of the Black Vienna circle. Note that it is possible that the player\u2019s replies are inconsistent and therefore that the puzzle has no solution.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a line with the number $N$ of investigations followed by $N$ lines; each line consists of a sequence of two distinct letters (from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018Z\u2019), a player number ($1$ or $2$) and a reply (an integer from $0$ to $2$).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n$0 \\leq N \\leq 50$ Number of investigations.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is the number of distinct admissible solutions, i.e.\u00a0sets of three members of the Black Vienna circle.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n0\nSample Output 1:\n2600\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\nAB 1 1\nAC 2 1\nBC 2 1\nSample Output 2:\n506\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
