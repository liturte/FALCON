Every partner has two skill levels: Frag, and Step. A larger Frag allows playing songs to earn a larger number of fragments, the main resource of the game. A larger Step helps the player progress faster in the World Mode that unlocks new songs and game stories. Some of the partners can optionally be awakened. After being awakened, a partner\u2019s Frag and Step both reach a higher level.\n\nA keen player of Arcaea is likely to have obtained many partners. But as one can only be accompanied by one partner when playing songs, partners with higher Frag and Step values are generally favored. We say a partner $x$ is more favorable than another partner $y$, if $x$\u2019s Frag value is strictly larger than $y$\u2019s Frag value, and $x$\u2019s Step value is strictly larger than $y$\u2019s Step value. Additionally, for a set $S$ of partners we define $d(S)$, the diversity of $S$, to be the maximum number of partners one can choose from $S$, so that no chosen partner is more favorable than another chosen partner.\n\nSeine is an Arcaea player who has a set $S$ of $n$ unawakened partners. Seine wants to choose at most $k$ partners to awaken to maximize $d(S)$. What is the maximum $d(S)$ she can achieve?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input has two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2000$). The next $n$ lines each have four integers $g, p, g_ a, p_ a$ to describe one partner\u2019s skill levels. The first two integers $g, p$ are the partner\u2019s Frag and Step values before being awakened ($1 \\leq g, p \\leq 10^9$). The last two integers $g_ a, p_ a$ are zeroes if the partner cannot be awakened. Otherwise $g_ a, p_ a$ give the partner\u2019s new Frag and Step values after being awakened, and it is guaranteed that $g < g_ a \\leq 10^9$ and $p < p_ a \\leq 10^9$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum $d(S)$ Seine can achieve, if she can awaken up to $k$ partners. Note that Seine may choose to not awaken any partner.\n\n-----Note-----\nArcaea is created and developed by Lowiro Limited. Lowiro does not endorse and has no involvement with the ProgNova contest.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n6 1\n78 61 88 71\n80 80 90 90\n70 90 80 100\n90 70 0 0\n80 67 0 0\n90 63 0 0\nSample Output:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
