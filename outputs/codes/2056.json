He then came up with this task and presented it to you.\n\nYou are given a collection of $n$ non-negative integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$. You are allowed to perform the following operation: choose two distinct indices $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$. If before the operation $a_i = x$, $a_j = y$, then after the operation $a_i = x~\\mathsf{AND}~y$, $a_j = x~\\mathsf{OR}~y$, where $\\mathsf{AND}$ and $\\mathsf{OR}$ are bitwise AND and OR respectively (refer to the Notes section for formal description). The operation may be performed any number of times (possibly zero).\n\nAfter all operations are done, compute $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2$\u00a0\u2014 the sum of squares of all $a_i$. What is the largest sum of squares you can achieve?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\leq a_i < 2^{20}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the largest possible sum of squares that can be achieved after several (possibly zero) operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n123\n\nOutput\n15129\n\nInput\n3\n1 3 5\n\nOutput\n51\n\nInput\n2\n349525 699050\n\nOutput\n1099509530625\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample no operation can be made, thus the answer is $123^2$.\n\nIn the second sample we can obtain the collection $1, 1, 7$, and $1^2 + 1^2 + 7^2 = 51$.\n\nIf $x$ and $y$ are represented in binary with equal number of bits (possibly with leading zeros), then each bit of $x~\\mathsf{AND}~y$ is set to $1$ if and only if both corresponding bits of $x$ and $y$ are set to $1$. Similarly, each bit of $x~\\mathsf{OR}~y$ is set to $1$ if and only if at least one of the corresponding bits of $x$ and $y$ are set to $1$. For example, $x = 3$ and $y = 5$ are represented as $011_2$ and $101_2$ (highest bit first). Then, $x~\\mathsf{AND}~y = 001_2 = 1$, and $x~\\mathsf{OR}~y = 111_2 = 7$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
