All the interior angles of the polygon must be strictly less than 180\u00b0.\nFor example, in the figure above, {A,C,E} and {B,D,E} form convex polygons; {A,C,D,E}, {A,B,C,E}, {A,B,C}, {D,E} and {} do not.\nFor a given set S, let n be the number of the points among the N points that are inside the convex hull of S (including the boundary and vertices). Then, we will define the score of S as 2^{n-|S|}.\nCompute the scores of all possible sets S that form convex polygons, and find the sum of all those scores.\nHowever, since the sum can be extremely large, print the sum modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1\u2264N\u2264200\n - 0\u2264x_i,y_i<10^4 (1\u2264i\u2264N)\n - If i\u2260j, x_i\u2260x_j or y_i\u2260y_j.\n - x_i and y_i are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nx_1 y_1\nx_2 y_2\n:\nx_N y_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the sum of all the scores modulo 998244353.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n1 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nWe have five possible sets as S, four sets that form triangles and one set that forms a square.
