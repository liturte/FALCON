Here people can make payments, and deposit or withdraw money in all kinds of strange currencies. At your first day on the job you help a customer from Nijmegia, a small insignificant country famous for its enormous coins with values equal to powers of $10$, that is, $1, 10, 100, 1000$, etc. This customer wants to make a rather large payment, and you are not looking forward to the prospect of carrying all those coins to and from the vault.\n\nYou therefore decide to think things over first. You have an enormous supply of Nijmegian coins in reserve, as does the customer (most citizens from Nijmegia are extremely strong). You now want to minimize the total number of coins that are exchanged, in either direction, to make the exact payment the customer has to make.\n\nFor example, if the customer wants to pay $83$ coins there are many ways to make the exchange. Here are three possibilities:Option 1.\n\nThe customer pays $8$ coins of value $10$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $8 + 3 = 11$ coins.Option 2.\n\nThe customer pays a coin of value $100$, and you return a coin of value $10$, and $7$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $1 + 1 + 7 = 9$ coins.Option 3.\n\nThe customer pays a coin of value $100$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. You return $2$ coins of value $10$. This requires exchanging $1 + 3 + 2 = 6$ coins.\n\nIt turns out the last way of doing it requires the least coins possible.\n\n-----Input-----\n - A single integer $0\\leq n < 10^{1000}$, the amount the customer from Nijmegia has to pay.\n\n-----Output-----\n - Output the minimum number of coins that have to be exchanged to make the required payment.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n83\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n13\nSample Output 2:\n4\n\nSample Input 3:\n0\nSample Output 3:\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
