There were also $N - 1$ interplanetary paths that connected all the planets (directly or indirectly). In other words, the network of planets and paths formed a tree. Additionally, each path was enumerated with an integer that denoted the curiosity of the path.\n\nA pair of planets $A$, $B$ is boring if the following holds:\n - $A$ and $B$ are different planets;\n - travelling between planet $A$ and $B$ is possible using one or more interplanetary paths; and\n - the binary XOR of the curiosity of all the paths in that travel is equal to 0\n\nAlas, the times have changed and an evil emperor is ruling the galaxy. He decided to use the Force to destroy all the interplanetary paths in a certain order. Determine the number of boring pairs of planets before the emperor started the destruction and after each destruction.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$). Each of the following $N - 1$ lines contains three integers $A_ i$, $B_ i$, $Z_ i$ ($1 \\leq A_ i, B_ i \\leq N$, $0 \\leq Z_ i \\leq 1000000000$) that denote that planets $A_ i$ and $B_ i$ are directly connected with a path of curiosity $Z_ i$. The following line of input contains the permutation of the first $N - 1$ integers that denote the order in which the emperor is destroying the paths. If the $i$-th element of the permutation is $j$, then the emperor destroyed the path between planets $A_ j$ and $B_ j$ in the $i$-th step.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output must contain $N$ lines, the $k$-th line containing the number of boring pairs A, $B$ from the task after the emperor destroyed exactly $k - 1$ paths.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\n1 2 0\n1\nSample Output 1:\n1\n0\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n1 2 4\n2 3 4\n1 2\nSample Output 2:\n1\n0\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
