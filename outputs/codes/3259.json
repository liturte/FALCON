After a bit of fumbling around he got the machine to do something. The machine now accepts 4 integers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$. After that hitting the big red glowing button labeled \u201cNE DIRAJ\u201d1 causes the machine to go crazy and follow the next routine:\n - Set the number of stones in the box labeled $L$ to $A$ modulo $B$.\n - It procedes to fly to the box labeled $L+1$, and set the number of stones there to $(2\\cdot A) \\mod B$.\n - It procedes to fly to the box labeled $L+2$, and set the number of stones there to $(3\\cdot A) \\mod B$.\n - Generaly, it visits each box labeled between $L$ and $R$, and set the number of stones there to $( (X - L + 1)\\cdot A) \\mod B$, where $X$ is the box label.\n - After it visits the box labeled $R$. It settles down for further instructions.\n\nDuring the game Aladin wonders what is the total number of stones in some range of boxes.\n\nWrite a program that simulates the device and answers Aladin\u2019s questions.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 1000000000$) ($1 \\leq Q \\leq 50000$), number of boxes and number of queries.\n\nThe next $Q$ lines contain information about the simulation.\n\nIf the line starts with 1, than it follows the format \u201c1 $L$ $R$ $A$ $B$\u201d ($1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$) ($1 \\leq A, B \\leq 1000000$), meaning that Aladin keyed in numbers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$ in the device and allowed the device to do its job.\n\nIf the line starts with 2, then it follows the format \u201c2 L R\u201d ($1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$), meaning that Aladin wonders how many stones in total are ther stones are in boxes labeled $L$ to $R$ (inclusive).\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query beginning with 2 output the answer to that particular query. Queries should be processed in the order they are given in the input.First sample description\n\nThe boxes start containing $\\{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\\} $, 0 stones in total. After that the device sets the stones to $\\{ 1 \\mod 2, 2 \\mod 2, 3 \\mod 2, 4 \\mod 2, 5 \\mod 2, 0\\} $ = $\\{ 1,0,1,0,1,0\\} $, or 3 stones in total.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\n2 1 6\n1 1 5 1 2\n2 1 6\nSample Output 1:\n0\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 5\n1 1 4 3 4\n2 1 1\n2 2 2\n2 3 3\n2 4 4\nSample Output 2:\n3\n2\n1\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
