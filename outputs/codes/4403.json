Takahashi is now going to eat four symbols, each of which is + or -. When he eats +, the integer in his mind increases by 1; when he eats -, the integer in his mind decreases by 1.\nThe symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string S. The i-th character in S is the i-th symbol for him to eat.\nFind the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - The length of S is 4.\n - Each character in S is + or -.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n+-++\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\n - Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0.\n - The first integer for him to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.\n - The second integer to eat is -. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 0.\n - The third integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 1.\n - The fourth integer to eat is +. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes 2.\nThus, the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols is 2.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
