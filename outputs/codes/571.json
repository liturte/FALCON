For example, parenthesis sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are correct (the resulting expressions are: \"(1+1)+(1+1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), while \")(\" and \")\" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition.\n\nWe define that $|s|$ as the length of string $s$. A strict prefix $s[1\\dots l]$ $(1\\leq l< |s|)$ of a string $s = s_1s_2\\dots s_{|s|}$ is string $s_1s_2\\dots s_l$. Note that the empty string and the whole string are not strict prefixes of any string by the definition.\n\nHaving learned these definitions, he comes up with a new problem. He writes down a string $s$ containing only characters \"(\", \")\" and \"?\". And what he is going to do, is to replace each of the \"?\" in $s$ independently by one of \"(\" and \")\" to make all strict prefixes of the new sequence not a correct parenthesis sequence, while the new sequence should be a correct parenthesis sequence.\n\nAfter all, he is just a primary school student so this problem is too hard for him to solve. As his best friend, can you help him to replace the question marks? If there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $|s|$ ($1\\leq |s|\\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$), the length of the string.\n\nThe second line contains a string $s$, containing only \"(\", \")\" and \"?\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nA single line contains a string representing the answer.\n\nIf there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.\n\nIf there is no answer, print a single line containing \":(\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n(?????\n\nOutput\n(()())\nInput\n10\n(???(???(?\n\nOutput\n:(\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIt can be proved that there is no solution for the second sample, so print \":(\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
