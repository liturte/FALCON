The difference between a tone is the same as two semitones. So the note that is one tone above $B$ is $C\\sharp $. The note that is one tone above $G$ is $A$.\n\nWe do not worry about flats such as $C\\flat $ nor do we worry about adding a $\\sharp $ sign to $B$ and $E$ in this problem (they are aliases for notes that are already listed).\n\nA major scale is defined by a note (such as $A$ or $C\\sharp $) and all other notes following that one in an arithmetic progression:tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone\n\nThe starting note appears in the name of the scale.\n\nFor example, the scale $A\\sharp $-major consists of the following notes:$A\\sharp $, $C$, $D$, $D\\sharp $, $F$, $G$, $A$, $A\\sharp $\n\n(by convention, the first note is repeated at the end of the sequence).\n\nNote that $A\\sharp $-major is typically not considered a standard musical scale. It is identical in sound to $B\\flat $, and proper notation of $A\\sharp $-major would require the use of double-sharps. We ignore such issues in this problem and just use the $12$ notes given at the top of this problem.\n\nFinally, in this problem a song is just a sequence of notes. Your job is to identify all major scales such that the song uses only notes in that scale.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input is an integer $1\\leq n \\leq 100$ denoting the number of notes played in a song. The second line consists of a sequence of notes, separated by spaces.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput consists of a single line that lists all scales the song may be played in. Consecutive scales should be separated by a single space and the scales must appear in lexicographic order. If the song may not fit in any one of these scales, simply output a line containing the text none.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10\nC D F D C D F F F C \nSample Output:\nA# C D# F\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
