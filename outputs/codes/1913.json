There also exists Great Gena's code, written in 2016. The problem this code solves is: given the number of tanks that go into the battle from each country, find their product. If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!\n\nThere are exactly n distinct countries in the world and the i-th country added a_{i} tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A beautiful number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', moreover it contains at most one digit '1'. However, due to complaints from players, some number of tanks of one country was removed from the game, hence the number of tanks of this country may not remain beautiful.\n\nYour task is to write the program that solves exactly the same problem in order to verify Gena's code correctness. Just in case.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers a_{i} without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the number of tanks of the i-th country.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the second line contains at least n - 1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100 000.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the product of the number of tanks presented by each country.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n5 10 1\n\nOutput\n50\nInput\n4\n1 1 10 11\n\nOutput\n110\nInput\n5\n0 3 1 100 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn sample 1 numbers 10 and 1 are beautiful, number 5 is not not.\n\nIn sample 2 number 11 is not beautiful (contains two '1's), all others are beautiful.\n\nIn sample 3 number 3 is not beautiful, all others are beautiful.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
