The forest has one tree at each of the positive integer lattice points. That is, there is a tree at every point $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers. You may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including those on the boundary of the rectangle.\n\nYou are standing at $(0,0)$ and Belle is standing at $(x_ b,y_ b)$. You can see Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of sight to Belle. If there is a tree at $(x_ b,y_ b)$, Belle will make it easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree facing your location.\n\nFor example, suppose that Belle is standing at $(2,6)$. If the trees in the rectangle with corners at $(1,1)$ and $(5,4)$ are cut down (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if the rectangle was at $(3,5)$ and $(5,7)$ (red rectangle in figure), then the tree at $(1,3)$ would be in the way.\n\nGiven the rectangle and Belle\u2019s location, can you see her?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integer $x_ b$ and $y_ b$\u00a0($1 \\leq x_ b,y_ b \\leq 10^{12}$), which are the coordinates that Belle is standing on.\n\nThe second line of input contains four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$ and $y_2$\u00a0($1 \\leq x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq 10^{12}$ and $1 \\leq y_1 \\leq y_2 \\leq 10^{12}$), which specify two opposite corners of the rectangle at $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf you can see Belle, display Yes.\n\nOtherwise, display No and the coordinates of the closest tree that is blocking your view.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 6\n1 1 5 4\nSample Output 1:\nYes\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 6\n3 5 5 7\nSample Output 2:\nNo\n1 3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
