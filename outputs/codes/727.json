For example, if Vasya's array is [13, 13, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 2], then after one operation it becomes [13, 13, 2, 2, 2].\n\nCompute the number of operations Vasya should make until the array becomes empty, i.e. Vasya removes all elements from it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 Vasya's array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of operations Vasya should make to remove all elements from the array.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 5 5 2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n6 3 4 1 5\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n8\n4 4 4 2 2 100 100 100\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6\n10 10 50 10 50 50\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, at first Vasya removes two fives at the second and third positions. The array becomes [2, 2]. In the second operation Vasya removes two twos at the first and second positions. After that the array becomes empty.\n\nIn the second example Vasya has to perform five operations to make the array empty. In each of them he removes the first element from the array.\n\nIn the third example Vasya needs three operations. In the first operation he removes all integers 4, in the second \u2014 all integers 100, in the third \u2014 all integers 2.\n\nIn the fourth example in the first operation Vasya removes the first two integers 10. After that the array becomes [50, 10, 50, 50]. Then in the second operation Vasya removes the two rightmost integers 50, so that the array becomes [50, 10]. In the third operation he removes the remaining 50, and the array becomes [10] after that. In the last, fourth operation he removes the only remaining 10. The array is empty after that.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
