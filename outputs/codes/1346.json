Every time Professor R taught a class, he gave a special problem for the students to solve. You being his favourite student, put your heart into solving it one last time.\n\nYou are given two polynomials $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ and $g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \\dots + b_{m-1}x^{m-1}$, with positive integral coefficients. It is guaranteed that the cumulative GCD of the coefficients is equal to $1$ for both the given polynomials. In other words, $gcd(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}) = gcd(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_{m-1}) = 1$. Let $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$. Suppose that $h(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \\dots + c_{n+m-2}x^{n+m-2}$. \n\nYou are also given a prime number $p$. Professor R challenges you to find any $t$ such that $c_t$ isn't divisible by $p$. He guarantees you that under these conditions such $t$ always exists. If there are several such $t$, output any of them.\n\nAs the input is quite large, please use fast input reading methods.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers, $n$, $m$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^6, 2 \\leq p \\leq 10^9$), \u00a0\u2014 $n$ and $m$ are the number of terms in $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectively (one more than the degrees of the respective polynomials) and $p$ is the given prime number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $p$ is prime.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^{i}$ in $f(x)$.\n\nThe third line contains $m$ integers $b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_{m-1}$ ($1 \\leq b_{i} \\leq 10^{9}$) \u00a0\u2014 $b_i$ is the coefficient of $x^{i}$ in $g(x)$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer $t$ ($0\\le t \\le n+m-2$) \u00a0\u2014 the appropriate power of $x$ in $h(x)$ whose coefficient isn't divisible by the given prime $p$. If there are multiple powers of $x$ that satisfy the condition, print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2 2\n1 1 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2 2 999999937\n2 1\n3 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, $f(x)$ is $2x^2 + x + 1$ and $g(x)$ is $x + 2$, their product $h(x)$ being $2x^3 + 5x^2 + 3x + 2$, so the answer can be 1 or 2 as both 3 and 5 aren't divisible by 2.\n\nIn the second test case, $f(x)$ is $x + 2$ and $g(x)$ is $x + 3$, their product $h(x)$ being $x^2 + 5x + 6$, so the answer can be any of the powers as no coefficient is divisible by the given prime.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
