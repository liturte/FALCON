If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then the answer is 0.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integer numbers x, y, l and r (2 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^18, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^18).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum length of The Golden Age within the interval [l, r].\n\nIf all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then print 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3 1 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 5 10 22\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n2 3 3 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the unlucky years are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10.
