For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: $\\left. \\begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \\hline & {2} & {9} & {16} & {23} & {30} \\\\ \\hline & {3} & {10} & {17} & {24} & {31} \\\\ \\hline & {4} & {11} & {18} & {25} & {} \\\\ \\hline & {5} & {12} & {19} & {26} & {} \\\\ \\hline & {6} & {13} & {20} & {27} & {} \\\\ \\hline & {7} & {14} & {21} & {28} & {} \\\\ \\hline 1 & {8} & {15} & {22} & {29} & {} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\right.$ \n\nPetr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contain two integers m and d (1 \u2264 m \u2264 12, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 7)\u00a0\u2014 the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month (1 is Monday, 7 is Sunday).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer: the number of columns the table should have.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 7\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n11 6\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.\n\nIn the second example 1-st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into 5 columns.\n\nIn the third example 1-st November is Saturday and 5 columns is enough.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
