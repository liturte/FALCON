Players \u00abCall of Soldiers 3\u00bb are numbered form 1 to (m + 1). Types of soldiers are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each player has an army. Army of the i-th player can be described by non-negative integer x_{i}. Consider binary representation of x_{i}: if the j-th bit of number x_{i} equal to one, then the army of the i-th player has soldiers of the j-th type. \n\nFedor is the (m + 1)-th player of the game. He assume that two players can become friends if their armies differ in at most k types of soldiers (in other words, binary representations of the corresponding numbers differ in at most k bits). Help Fedor and count how many players can become his friends.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 20;\u00a01 \u2264 m \u2264 1000).\n\nThe i-th of the next (m + 1) lines contains a single integer x_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 2^{n} - 1), that describes the i-th player's army. We remind you that Fedor is the (m + 1)-th player.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of Fedor's potential friends.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 1\n8\n5\n111\n17\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3 3 3\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nOutput\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
