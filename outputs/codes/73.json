This book had c pages.\n\nAt first day Mister B read v_0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v_0 pages, at second\u00a0\u2014 v_0 + a pages, at third\u00a0\u2014 v_0 + 2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v_1 pages per day.\n\nAlso, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.\n\nHelp Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v_0, v_1, a and l (1 \u2264 c \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 l < v_0 \u2264 v_1 \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1000) \u2014 the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5 10 5 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n12 4 12 4 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n15 1 100 0 0\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test the book contains 5 pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.\n\nIn the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day\u00a0\u2014 4 - 11, at third day\u00a0\u2014 11 - 12 and finished the book.\n\nIn third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
