Mike is crazy about collecting stamps. He is an active member of Stamp Collecting \u0421ommunity(SCC). \n\nSCC consists of N members which are fond of philately. A few days ago Mike argued with the others from SCC. Mike told them that all stamps of the members could be divided in such a way that i'th member would get i postage stamps. Now Mike wants to know if he was right. The next SCC meeting is tomorrow. Mike still has no answer.\n\nSo, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has Ci stamps in his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of members of SCC.\nThe second line contains N integers Ci, denoting the numbers of the stamps in the collection of i'th member.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first line should contain YES, if we can obtain the required division, otherwise NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100 000;\n1 \u2264  Ci \u2264 109.\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput:\n5\n7 4 1 1 2\n\nOutput:\nYES\n\nInput:\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput:\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
