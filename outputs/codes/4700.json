N. The elevation of Obs. i is H_i.\nThere are also M roads, each connecting two different observatories. Road j connects Obs. A_j and Obs. B_j.\nObs. i is said to be good when its elevation is higher than those of all observatories that can be reached from Obs. i using just one road.\nNote that Obs. i is also good when no observatory can be reached from Obs. i using just one road.\nHow many good observatories are there?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq A_i,B_i \\leq N\n - A_i \\neq B_i\n - Multiple roads may connect the same pair of observatories.\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nH_1 H_2 ... H_N\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n:\nA_M B_M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of good observatories.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 3\n1 2 3 4\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\n - From Obs. 1, you can reach Obs. 3 using just one road. The elevation of Obs. 1 is not higher than that of Obs. 3, so Obs. 1 is not good.\n - From Obs. 2, you can reach Obs. 3 and 4 using just one road. The elevation of Obs. 2 is not higher than that of Obs. 3, so Obs. 2 is not good.\n - From Obs. 3, you can reach Obs. 1 and 2 using just one road. The elevation of Obs. 3 is higher than those of Obs. 1 and 2, so Obs. 3 is good.\n - From Obs. 4, you can reach Obs. 2 using just one road. The elevation of Obs. 4 is higher than that of Obs. 2, so Obs. 4 is good.\nThus, the good observatories are Obs. 3 and 4, so there are two good observatories.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
