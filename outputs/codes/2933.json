Wallace has some weight plates lying around, possibly of different weights, and its goal is to add some of the plates to a bar so that it can train with a weight as close as possible to $1000$ kg.\n\nIn case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to $1000$ (e.g. $998$ and $1002$), Wallace will pick the greater one (in this case $1002$).\n\nHelp Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus and tell it which weight it will have to lift.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains the number of plates $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$). Each of the following $n$ lines contains one positive integer less than or equal to $1000$, denoting the weight of each plate.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one integer, the combined weight closest to $1000$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n900\n500\n498\n4\nSample Output:\n1002\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
