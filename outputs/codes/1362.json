Among the following m days, there are n days when Arkady will top up the account: in the day d_{i} he will deposit t_{i} rubles on his mobile phone account. Arkady will always top up the account before the daily payment will be done. There will be no other payments nor tops up in the following m days.\n\nDetermine the number of days starting from the 1-st to the m-th such that the account will have a negative amount on it after the daily payment (i.\u00a0e. in evening). Initially the account's balance is zero rubles.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, p and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^9, n \u2264 m) \u2014 the number of days Arkady will top up the account, the amount of the daily payment, and the number of days you should check.\n\nThe i-th of the following n lines contains two integers d_{i} and t_{i} (1 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the index of the day when Arkady will make the i-th top up, and the amount he will deposit on this day.
