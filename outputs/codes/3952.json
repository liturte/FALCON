Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.\n\nThe strange area is enclosed by three lines, $x = l$, $y = a$ and $x = r$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $l$, $r$ and $a$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $l < r$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $x$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area. [Image] \n\nA point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$. For example, in the above figure, $p_1$ is in the area while $p_2$ is not.\n\nTokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\times 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points on the plane.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the $i$-th point.\n\nAll points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n4\n2 1\n2 2\n3 1\n3 2\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example, there is exactly one set having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$, so the total number is $3$.\n\nFor the second example, the numbers of sets having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$ are $3$, $2$, $1$ respectively, and their sum is $6$.\n\nFor the third example, as the following figure shows, there are  $2$ sets having one point;  $3$ sets having two points;  $1$ set having four points. \n\nTherefore, the number of different non-empty sets in this example is $2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 6$.
