He loves connecting with other bears via social networks. He has n friends and his relation with the i-th of them is described by a unique integer t_{i}. The bigger this value is, the better the friendship is. No two friends have the same value t_{i}.\n\nSpring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in. All his friends still sleep and thus none of them is online. Some (maybe all) of them will appear online in the next hours, one at a time.\n\nThe system displays friends who are online. On the screen there is space to display at most k friends. If there are more than k friends online then the system displays only k best of them\u00a0\u2014 those with biggest t_{i}.\n\nYour task is to handle queries of two types:  \"1 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend id becomes online. It's guaranteed that he wasn't online before.  \"2 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Check whether friend id is displayed by the system. Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" in a separate line. \n\nAre you able to help Limak and answer all queries of the second type?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, k and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 150 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 min(6, n))\u00a0\u2014 the number of friends, the maximum number of displayed online friends and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 10^9) where t_{i} describes how good is Limak's relation with the i-th friend.\n\nThe i-th of the following q lines contains two integers type_{i} and id_{i} (1 \u2264 type_{i} \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 id_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the i-th query. If type_{i} = 1 then a friend id_{i} becomes online. If type_{i} = 2 then you should check whether a friend id_{i} is displayed.\n\nIt's guaranteed that no two queries of the first type will have the same id_{i} becuase one friend can't become online twice. Also, it's guaranteed that at least one query will be of the second type (type_{i} = 2) so the output won't be empty.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query of the second type print one line with the answer\u00a0\u2014 \"YES\" (without quotes) if the given friend is displayed and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2 8\n300 950 500 200\n1 3\n2 4\n2 3\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\nInput\n6 3 9\n50 20 51 17 99 24\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n1 2\n2 4\n2 2\n1 1\n2 4\n2 3\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Limak has 4 friends who all sleep initially. At first, the system displays nobody because nobody is online. There are the following 8 queries:  \"1 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 3 becomes online.  \"2 4\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print \"NO\".  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print \"YES\".  \"1 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3.  \"1 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given k = 2 so only two friends can be displayed. Limak has worse relation with friend 1 than with other two online friends (t_1 < t_2, t_3) so friend 1 won't be displayed  \"2 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"NO\".  \"2 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"YES\".  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Print \"YES\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
