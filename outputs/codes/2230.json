One day he bought n^2 candy bags. One bag has one candy, one bag has two candies, one bag has three candies and so on. In fact, for each integer k from 1 to n^2 he has exactly one bag with k candies. \n\nHelp him give n bags of candies to each brother so that all brothers got the same number of candies.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line contains a single integer n (n is even, 2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of Gerald's brothers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nLet's assume that Gerald indexes his brothers with numbers from 1 to n. You need to print n lines, on the i-th line print n integers \u2014 the numbers of candies in the bags for the i-th brother. Naturally, all these numbers should be distinct and be within limits from 1 to n^2. You can print the numbers in the lines in any order. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the solution exists at the given limits.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n1 4\n2 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe sample shows Gerald's actions if he has two brothers. In this case, his bags contain 1, 2, 3 and 4 candies. He can give the bags with 1 and 4 candies to one brother and the bags with 2 and 3 to the other brother.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
