You can move from interval (a, b) from our set to interval (c, d) from our set if and only if c < a < d or c < b < d. Also there is a path from interval I_1 from our set to interval I_2 from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from I_1 so that we can reach I_2.\n\nYour program should handle the queries of the following two types:  \"1 x y\" (x < y) \u2014 add the new interval (x, y) to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals. \"2 a b\" (a \u2260 b) \u2014 answer the question: is there a path from a-th (one-based) added interval to b-th (one-based) added interval? \n\nAnswer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n denoting the number of queries, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed 10^9 by their absolute value.\n\nIt's guaranteed that all queries are correct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query of the second type print \"YES\" or \"NO\" on a separate line depending on the answer.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 1 5\n1 5 11\n2 1 2\n1 2 9\n2 1 2\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
