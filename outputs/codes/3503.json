The exam consists of $n$ questions. In each question the students have to add ($+$), subtract ($-$) or multiply ($*$) a pair of numbers. \n\nEllen has already chosen the $n$ pairs of numbers. All that remains is to decide for each pair which of the three possible operations the students should perform. To avoid students getting bored, Ellen wants to make sure that the $n$ correct answers to her exam are all different.\n\nPlease help Ellen finish constructing the exam by automating this task.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with one integer $n$ ($1\\leq n \\leq 2500$), the number of pairs of numbers;\n - $n$ lines each with two integers $a$ and $b$ ($-10^6 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^6$), a pair of numbers used.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each pair of numbers $(a,b)$ in the same order as in the input, output a line containing a valid equation. Each equation should consist of five parts: $a$, one of the three operators, $b$, an equals sign ($=$), and the result of the expression. All the $n$ expression results must be different.\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers you may output any of them. If there is no valid answer, output a single line with the string \u201cimpossible\u201d instead.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 5\n3 3\n4 5\n-1 -6\nSample Output:\n1 + 5 = 6\n3 * 3 = 9\n4 - 5 = -1\n-1 - -6 = 5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
