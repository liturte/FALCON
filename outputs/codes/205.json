For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.\n\nHowever, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.\n\nGiven two integers $n$ and $b$ (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary (in the base/radix of $b$) representation of $n\\,!$ (factorial of $n$). \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$, $2 \\le b \\le 10^{12}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint an only integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary representation of $n!$\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n38 11\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, $6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}$.\n\nIn the third and fourth example, $5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}$.\n\nThe representation of the number $x$ in the $b$-ary base is $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$ if $x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + \\ldots + d_k b^0$, where $d_i$ are integers and $0 \\le d_i \\le b - 1$. For example, the number $720$ from the first example is represented as $880_{(9)}$ since $720 = 8 \\cdot 9^2 + 8 \\cdot 9 + 0 \\cdot 1$.\n\nYou can read more about bases here.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
