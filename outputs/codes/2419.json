You can perform a sequence of operations: during the first operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $1$; during the second operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $2$, and so on. You choose the number of these operations yourself.\n\nFor example, if $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, you can perform the following sequence of three operations:   add $1$ to $a$, then $a = 2$ and $b = 3$;  add $2$ to $b$, then $a = 2$ and $b = 5$;  add $3$ to $a$, then $a = 5$ and $b = 5$. \n\nCalculate the minimum number of operations required to make $a$ and $b$ equal. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum numbers of operations required to make $a$ and $b$ equal. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n1 3\n11 11\n30 20\n\nOutput\n3\n0\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFirst test case considered in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case integers $a$ and $b$ are already equal, so you don't need to perform any operations.\n\nIn the third test case you have to apply the first, the second, the third and the fourth operation to $b$ ($b$ turns into $20 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 30$).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
