As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.\n\nTo decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.\n\nFor example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.\n\nDima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. \n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n3 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.\n\nIn the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
