Cookies are really simple polygons that rotate clockwise while in flight.\n\nDue to many years of advanced research and precise throwing equipment, these cookies can fly under idealized conditions: their center of mass follows an ideal parabola ($g = 9.81 \\frac{m}{s^2}$), and their angular velocity stays constant.\n\nGiven a cookie\u2019s shape, initial angle and speed as well as its angular velocity, compute which of the cookie\u2019s corners hits the wall first, and when!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains $5$ numbers: an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 20$) denoting the number of vertices of the cookie polygon, a real number $\\omega $ ($0 \\le \\omega \\le 10$), the angular velocity in $\\text {rad}/s$ in clockwise direction, a real number $v_0$ ($1 \\le v_0 \\le 10$), the initial velocity of the cookie in $\\frac{m}{s}$, an integer $\\theta $ ($0 \\le \\theta \\le 80$), the initial angle of the cookie\u2019s trajectory, given in degrees measured counter-clockwise relative to the $(1, 0)$ unit vector, a real number $w$ ($20 \\le w \\le 500$), denoting the $x$-coordinate of the wall towards which the cookie is moving. You may assume that there are no other objects in space aside from the cookie, and that the wall is of infinite height (e.g., from $-\\infty \\ldots \\infty $).\n\nThis is followed by $n$ lines, one for each vertex. Each line contains two real numbers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($|x_ i| < 20, |y_ i| < 20$) denoting the initial position of a cookie\u2019s corner. Corners are numbered $1 \\ldots n$. The cookie polygon\u2019s vertices are given in counter-clockwise order. The polygon is simple (e.g., not self-intersecting) and has a non-zero area.\n\nAll real numbers are given with no more than $6$ decimal digits after the period.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput two numbers $i$ and $T_ i$, denoting the index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) of the corner that hits the wall first and the time $T_ i$ in seconds when that happens. The index corresponds to the order in the input. $T_ i$ must be given with an absolute error of less than $10^{-3}$! You may assume that no two vertices hit the wall within $10^{-2}$ seconds of each other, and that the first vertex to hit the wall would pierce it for at least $10^{-3}$ seconds.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 6 5 45 20\n0 0\n2 0\n1 1.5\nSample Output 1:\n2 5.086781\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 0.25 2 45 20\n0 0\n2 0\n1 1.5\nSample Output 2:\n1 12.715255\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
