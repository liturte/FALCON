Each test case will begin with a line with three integers:\n\n$n \\ m \\ k$\n\nWhere $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$) is the number of nodes in the graph, $m$ (limited by the structure of the graph) is the number of edges in the graph, and $k$ ($0 \\le k < n$) is the number of blue edges desired in the spanning tree. Each of the next $m$ lines will contain three elements, describing the edges:\n\n$c \\ f \\ t$\n\nWhere $c$ is a character, either capital R or capital B, indicating the color of the edge, and $f$ and $t$ are integers ($1 \\le f, t \\le n, t \\ne f$) indicating the nodes that edge goes from and to. The graph is guaranteed to be connected, and there is guaranteed to be at most one edge between any pair of nodes.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line, containing $1$ if it is possible to build a spanning tree with exactly $k$ blue edges, and $0$ if it is not possible.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3 2\nB 1 2\nB 2 3\nR 3 1\nSample Output:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
