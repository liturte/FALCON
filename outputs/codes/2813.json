It consists of three phrases of $5$, $7$ and $5$ syllables each.\n\nOnce a year, HiQ has a haiku contest, where employees submit their best poems. The poems are then judged based on a wide range of aspects, such as\n - creativity\n - simplicity\n - beauty\n - whether the poem is actually a haiku\n\nThis last point turned out to be quite a challenge for the judges (many problems arose when half the judges indexed syllables starting at $0$ and the other half at $1$).\n\nCan you help the judges to determine whether a submitted poem is a haiku, given a set of syllables? Note that there may exist multiple decompositions of a single word in the poem into syllables. In this case, you should determine whether some decomposition is a haiku.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $1 \\le S \\le 100$, the number of syllables. The next line contains $S$ words separated by spaces (the syllables). Each syllable contains at most $7$ lowercase letters a-z.\n\nThen, three lines containing the poem follow. Each line contains a (non-empty) list of words separated by spaces, representing a phrase. The words contain only lowercase letters a-z. The length of each line is at most $100$ characters (including spaces).\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one decomposition of the poem into the given syllables.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput \u201chaiku\u201d if the given poem is a haiku, and \u201ccome back next year\u201d otherwise (without the quotes).\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Input 1-----\nOne possible decomposition into a haiku is:\n\nspe-lling ve-ry hard\near-ly in mor-ning ti-red\ni need cov-fe-fe\n\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Input 3-----\nNo matter how the third line is decomposed, it contains $8$ syllables instead of $5$, so it can not be a haiku.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n20\nva\nfi\nve\nmor\nlling\nspe\nin\ni\nsh\nti\nhard\ncov\near\nfe\nred\nja\nry\nneed\nly\nning\nspelling very hard\nearly in morning tired\ni need covfefe\nSample Output 1:\nhaiku\n\nSample Input 2:\n22\nq\nc\nda\nplus\nto\nthe\ne\nthee\nun\nlate\nci\na\nshall\nby\ncom\ni\nru\npare\ntemp\nble\nhi\nde\nshall i compare thee\nto a c plus plus template\nundecidable\nSample Output 2:\nhaiku\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
