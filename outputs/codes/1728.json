The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, the root is the vertex number 1.\n\nEach vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex v by c_{v}. Initially c_{v} = 0.\n\nYou have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex v and a color x, and then color all vectices in the subtree of v (including v itself) in color x. In other words, for every vertex u, such that the path from root to u passes through v, set c_{u} = x.\n\nIt is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from 0.\n\nYou can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n - 1 integers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} < i), where p_{i} means that there is an edge between vertices i and p_{i}.\n\nThe third line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 n), where c_{i} is the color you should color the i-th vertex into.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 2 2 1 5\n2 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n7\n1 1 2 3 1 4\n3 3 1 1 1 2 3\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe tree from the first sample is shown on the picture (numbers are vetices' indices):\n\n$A$\n\nOn first step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 1 into color 2 (numbers are colors):\n\n[Image]\n\nOn seond step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 5 into color 1:\n\n[Image]\n\nOn third step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 2 into color 1:\n\n[Image]\n\nThe tree from the second sample is shown on the picture (numbers are vetices' indices):\n\n[Image]\n\nOn first step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 1 into color 3 (numbers are colors):\n\n[Image]\n\nOn second step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 3 into color 1:\n\n$8$\n\nOn third step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 6 into color 2:\n\n[Image]\n\nOn fourth step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 4 into color 1:\n\n[Image]\n\nOn fith step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 7 into color 3:\n\n[Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
