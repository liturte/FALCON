We can assume that the sheets are infinitely large in any direction.\n\nTo draw a picture, Leo Jr. colors some of the cells on a sheet gray. He considers the resulting picture beautiful if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\n\n The picture is connected, that is, it is possible to get from any gray cell to any other by following a chain of gray cells, with each pair of adjacent cells in the path being neighbours (that is, sharing a side).\n\n Each gray cell has an even number of gray neighbours.\n\n There are exactly $n$ gray cells with all gray neighbours. The number of other gray cells can be arbitrary (but reasonable, so that they can all be listed).\n\nLeo Jr. is now struggling to draw a beautiful picture with a particular choice of $n$. Help him, and provide any example of a beautiful picture.\n\nTo output cell coordinates in your answer, assume that the sheet is provided with a Cartesian coordinate system such that one of the cells is chosen to be the origin $(0, 0)$, axes $0x$ and $0y$ are orthogonal and parallel to grid lines, and a unit step along any axis in any direction takes you to a neighbouring cell.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 500$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in a beautiful picture.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer $k$\u00a0\u2014 the number of gray cells in your picture. For technical reasons, $k$ should not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nEach of the following $k$ lines should contain two integers\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of a gray cell in your picture. All listed cells should be distinct, and the picture should satisdfy all the properties listed above. All coordinates should not exceed $10^9$ by absolute value.\n\nOne can show that there exists an answer satisfying all requirements with a small enough $k$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n12\n1 0\n2 0\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n0 2\n1 2\n2 2\n3 2\n1 3\n2 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe answer for the sample is pictured below:\n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
