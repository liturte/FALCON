In fact, she loves every number that is not a multiple of $n$ (she really hates the number $n$). For her friends\u2019 birthdays this year, Gwen has decided to draw each of them a sequence of $n-1$ flowers. Each of the flowers will contain between $1$ and $n-1$ flower petals (inclusive). Because of her hatred of multiples of $n$, the total number of petals in any non-empty contiguous subsequence of flowers cannot be a multiple of $n$. For example, if $n = 5$, then the top two paintings are valid, while the bottom painting is not valid since the second, third and fourth flowers have a total of $10$ petals. (The top two images are Sample Input $3$ and $4$.)\n\nGwen wants her paintings to be unique, so no two paintings will have the same sequence of flowers. To keep track of this, Gwen recorded each painting as a sequence of $n-1$ numbers specifying the number of petals in each flower from left to right. She has written down all valid sequences of length $n-1$ in lexicographical order. A sequence $a_1,a_2,\\dots , a_{n-1}$ is lexicographically smaller than $b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_{n-1}$ if there exists an index $k$ such that $a_ i = b_ i$ for $i < k$ and $a_ k < b_ k$.\n\nWhat is the $k$th sequence on Gwen\u2019s list?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two integers $n$\u00a0($2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$), which is Gwen\u2019s hated number, and $k$\u00a0($1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{18}$), which is the index of the valid sequence in question if all valid sequences were ordered lexicographically. It is guaranteed that there exist at least $k$ valid sequences for this value of $n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay the $k$th sequence on Gwen\u2019s list.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\nSample Output 1:\n2 1 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 1\nSample Output 2:\n1\n\nSample Input 3:\n5 22\nSample Output 3:\n4 3 4 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
