The ellipse consists of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + \\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_2, p) = D$.\n\nWhen one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a distance measure.\n\nThis problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space we will work in is the space of words of length $n$ using an alphabet of $q$ different symbols, often denoted as $F_ q^n$. As you can probably see, for given values of $q$ and $n$, there are $q^n$ different words (points) in the space $F_ q^n$.\n\nFor a distance measure, we use the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two words $x, y \\in F_ q^n$ is simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up the words $x$ and $y$ differ. For example, the Hamming distance between words 01201 and 21210 is 3 because there are 3 positions where the words have different symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in $F_ q^n$ will always be an integer between $0$ and $n$, inclusive.\n\nWithin the space $F_ q^n$, we now define the Hamming ellipse as the set of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_1, p) + \\mathop {\\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_2, p) = D$. Given values $q$ and $n$, focal points $f_1$ and $f_2$ and distance $D$, we ask you to determine the number of points $p \\in F_ q^n$ that lie on this Hamming ellipse.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains three integers $q$ ($2 \\le q \\le 10$), $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) and $D$ ($1 \\le D \\le 2 n$).\n\nThe second and third lines specify the two focal points $f_1$ and $f_2$, each formatted as a string of length $n$ using digits $\\{ 0, 1 \\ldots q - 1\\} $.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line containing a single integer, denoting the number of points on the ellipse.\n\nThe input is chosen such that the answer is less than $2^{63}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 5 9\n01201\n21210\nSample Output 1:\n24\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 6 5\n123031\n231222\nSample Output 2:\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
