The $i$-th square initially has the color $c_i$.\n\nLet's say, that two squares $i$ and $j$ belong to the same connected component if $c_i = c_j$, and $c_i = c_k$ for all $k$ satisfying $i < k < j$. In other words, all squares on the segment from $i$ to $j$ should have the same color.\n\nFor example, the line $[3, 3, 3]$ has $1$ connected component, while the line $[5, 2, 4, 4]$ has $3$ connected components.\n\nThe game \"flood fill\" is played on the given line as follows:   At the start of the game you pick any starting square (this is not counted as a turn).  Then, in each game turn, change the color of the connected component containing the starting square to any other color. \n\nFind the minimum number of turns needed for the entire line to be changed into a single color.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of squares.\n\nThe second line contains integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le 5000$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial colors of the squares.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of the turns needed.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n5 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n8\n4 5 2 2 1 3 5 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1\n4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, a possible way to achieve an optimal answer is to pick square with index $2$ as the starting square and then play as follows:  $[5, 2, 2, 1]$  $[5, 5, 5, 1]$  $[1, 1, 1, 1]$ \n\nIn the second example, a possible way to achieve an optimal answer is to pick square with index $5$ as the starting square and then perform recoloring into colors $2, 3, 5, 4$ in that order.\n\nIn the third example, the line already consists of one color only.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
