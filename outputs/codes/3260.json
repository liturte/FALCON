Brandon Greg Jr. is sometimes a drowning combinatorist.\n\nA permutation of length $n$ can be represented as some order of the integers $\\{ 1,2,\\ldots ,n\\} $. A run of length $k$ in a permutation is $k$ consecutive elements that appear in increasing or decreasing order. For example, $[5,2,4,3,1]$ is a permutation of length $5$, where (among other runs), $[2,4]$ is a run of length $2$ and $[4,3,1]$ is a run of length $3$.\n\nBrandon found a way to count the number of permutations of length $n$ that have runs of length at most $k$. He wants you to do the same so he could check his answers. Since the numbers get very large, Brandon will ask for it modulo some prime $p$ of his choice.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe only line of input contains three space-separated integers $n, k, p$ ($1\\le n\\le 2000$, $2\\le k\\le 7$, $10^8<p\\le 10^9+9$), where $n$ is the length of the permutations, $k$ is the maximum length of a run, and $p$ is the prime of Brandon\u2019s choice.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one integer representing the number of permutations of length $n$ that have runs of length at most $k$, modulo $p$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1 7 1000000007\nSample Output 1:\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 2 1000000007\nSample Output 2:\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
