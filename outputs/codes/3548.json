One of her most impressive feats is the mixing a series of drinks using each of the $N$ distinct drink ingredients in the bar exactly once. She does this in the following way.\n\nFirst, Pia chooses a number of drinks to make. Each of the drink ingredients are then lined up in front of her in order $1, 2, \\dots , N$. For the first drink, she uses some positive number $K$ of ingredients starting from the left, i.e. $1, 2, ..., K$. For the next drink, she uses some positive number $L$ of ingredients starting from the first unused ingredient, i.e. $K + 1, K + 2, \\dots , K + L$. She continues this process until the final drink, which uses some set of ingredients $N - M, N - M + 1, \\dots , N$.\n\nHowever, not every pair of ingredients work well in a drink. For example, milk and water would not go very well together. She may not include a bad pair of ingredients in any drink.\n\nSo far, she has managed to make a different set of drinks every night. For how many nights can she mix a new set of drinks? We call two sets of drinks different if they do not consist of the exact same drinks (though they are allowed to have drinks in common).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $1 \\le N \\le 100000$ and $0 \\le P \\le 100000$, the number of ingredients and bad pairs of ingredients.\n\nEach of the next $P$ lines contains two integers $1 \\le a \\not= b \\le N$, two ingredients that do not work well together in a drink. The same pair of ingredients may appear multiple times in this list.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, the number of nights Pia can construct a different set of drinks. Since this number may be large, output the remainder when divided by $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 3\n1 3\n4 5\n2 4\nSample Output:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
