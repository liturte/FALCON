The lake is inhabited by the frog Barica, who jumps acrossplants floating on the lake\u2019s surface. Knowing a fair number of folk tales, Luka knows that if he kisses Barica, she will turn into a beautiful princess. However, he needs to catch her first! Assuming an aerial view, the position of a plant on the lake\u2019s surface can be defined with a paircoordinates. From plant $(x, y)$ Barica can jump:\n - To plant $(x+P, y+P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $A$.\n - To plant $(x+P, y-P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $B$.\n - To plant $(x-P, y+P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $C$.\n - To plant $(x-P, y-P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $D$.\n\nBarica selects one of the four directions and jumps onto the first plant in the chosen direction. If there is no plant in the selected direction, Barica stays where she is. After Barica jumps, the plant she jumped from sinks and disappears.\n\nKnowing the locations of the plants and the sequence of directions Barica chooses, Luka wantsdetermine coordinates of the plant Barica will end up on. Luka will wait for her at that plant, ambush her and kiss her.\n\nWrite a program that solves Luka\u2019s problem and helps him turn Barica into a beautiful princess.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ $(1 \\leq N, K \\leq 100000)$, the number of plants and the number of attempted jump. The second line contains $K$ letters each of which is \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 or \u2018D\u2019. These letters represent in order the directions in which Barica attempts to jump.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ $(0 \\leq X \\leq 1000000000, 0 \\leq Y \\leq 1000000000$), the coordinates of one plant. Barica is initially located on the first plant.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput Barica\u2019s final coordinates.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n7 5\nACDBB\n5 6\n8 9\n4 13\n1 10\n7 4\n10 9\n3 7\nSample Output:\n7 4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
