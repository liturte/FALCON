People have already started moving in. However, some of the houses aren\u2019t connected to the internet yet, and naturally residents are outraged.\n\nThe houses are numbered $1$ to $N$. House number $1$ has already been connected to the internet via a long network cable to a neighboring town. The plan is to provide internet to other houses by connecting pairs of houses with separate network cables. A house is connected to the internet if it has a network cable to another house that\u2019s already connected to the internet.\n\nGiven a list of which pairs of houses are already connected by a network cable, determine which houses are not yet connected to the internet.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $1 \\leq N,M \\leq 200000$, where $N$ is the number of houses and $M$ is the number of network cables already deployed. Then follow $M$ lines, each containing a pair of distinct house numbers $1 \\leq a, b \\leq N$ meaning that house number $a$ and house number $b$ are already connected by a network cable. Each house pair is listed at most once in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf all the houses are already connected to the internet, output one line containing the string Connected. Otherwise, output a list of house numbers in increasing order, one per line, representing the houses that are not yet connected to the internet.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n6 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n5 6\nSample Output 1:\n5\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 1\n2 1\nSample Output 2:\nConnected\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
