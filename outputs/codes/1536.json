In this version, $n \\le 2000$.\n\nThere are $n$ distinct points in three-dimensional space numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th point has coordinates $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$. The number of points $n$ is even.\n\nYou'd like to remove all $n$ points using a sequence of $\\frac{n}{2}$ snaps. In one snap, you can remove any two points $a$ and $b$ that have not been removed yet and form a perfectly balanced pair. A pair of points $a$ and $b$ is perfectly balanced if no other point $c$ (that has not been removed yet) lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $a$ and $b$.\n\nFormally, point $c$ lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $a$ and $b$ if and only if $\\min(x_a, x_b) \\le x_c \\le \\max(x_a, x_b)$, $\\min(y_a, y_b) \\le y_c \\le \\max(y_a, y_b)$, and $\\min(z_a, z_b) \\le z_c \\le \\max(z_a, z_b)$. Note that the bounding box might be degenerate. \n\nFind a way to remove all points in $\\frac{n}{2}$ snaps.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2000$; $n$ is even), denoting the number of points.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$, $z_i$ ($-10^8 \\le x_i, y_i, z_i \\le 10^8$), denoting the coordinates of the $i$-th point.\n\nNo two points coincide.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $\\frac{n}{2}$ pairs of integers $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$), denoting the indices of points removed on snap $i$. Every integer between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, must appear in your output exactly once.\n\nWe can show that it is always possible to remove all points. If there are many solutions, output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n3 1 0\n0 3 0\n2 2 0\n1 0 0\n1 3 0\n0 1 0\n\nOutput\n3 6\n5 1\n2 4\n\nInput\n8\n0 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n3 2 2\n2 3 2\n2 2 3\n\nOutput\n4 5\n1 6\n2 7\n3 8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, here is what points and their corresponding bounding boxes look like (drawn in two dimensions for simplicity, as all points lie on $z = 0$ plane). Note that order of removing matters: for example, points $5$ and $1$ don't form a perfectly balanced pair initially, but they do after point $3$ is removed.
