(In this problem, the ground floor is called the first floor.)\nFor each i = 1,\\dots, 100, the i-th floor of A and that of B are connected by a corridor.\nAlso, for each i = 1,\\dots, 99, there is a corridor that connects the (i+1)-th floor of A and the i-th floor of B.\nYou can traverse each of those corridors in both directions, and it takes you x minutes to get to the other end.\nAdditionally, both of the buildings have staircases. For each i = 1,\\dots, 99, a staircase connects the i-th and (i+1)-th floors of a building, and you need y minutes to get to an adjacent floor by taking the stairs.\nFind the minimum time needed to reach the b-th floor of B from the a-th floor of A.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq a,b,x,y \\leq 100\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\na b x y\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum time needed to reach the b-th floor of B from the a-th floor of A.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 1 1 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nThere is a corridor that directly connects the 2-nd floor of A and the 1-st floor of B, so you can travel between them in 1 minute.\nThis is the fastest way to get there, since taking the stairs just once costs you 5 minutes.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
