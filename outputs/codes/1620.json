He doesn't like palindromes, so he changed Naviek to Navick.\n\nHe is too selfish, so for a given n he wants to obtain a string of n characters, each of which is either 'a', 'b' or 'c', with no palindromes of length 3 appearing in the string as a substring. For example, the strings \"abc\" and \"abca\" suit him, while the string \"aba\" doesn't. He also want the number of letters 'c' in his string to be as little as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the string that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\naa\n\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\nbba\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nA palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
