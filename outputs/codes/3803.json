Yang and the monster each have 3 attributes: hitpoints (HP), offensive power (ATK) and defensive power (DEF).\n\nDuring the battle, every second the monster's HP decrease by max(0, ATK_{Y} - DEF_{M}), while Yang's HP decreases by max(0, ATK_{M} - DEF_{Y}), where index Y denotes Master Yang and index M denotes monster. Both decreases happen simultaneously Once monster's HP \u2264 0 and the same time Master Yang's HP > 0, Master Yang wins.\n\nMaster Yang can buy attributes from the magic shop of Cyberland: h bitcoins per HP, a bitcoins per ATK, and d bitcoins per DEF.\n\nNow Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers HP_{Y}, ATK_{Y}, DEF_{Y}, separated by a space, denoting the initial HP, ATK and DEF of Master Yang.\n\nThe second line contains three integers HP_{M}, ATK_{M}, DEF_{M}, separated by a space, denoting the HP, ATK and DEF of the monster.\n\nThe third line contains three integers h, a, d, separated by a space, denoting the price of 1\u00a0HP, 1\u00a0ATK and 1\u00a0DEF.\n\nAll numbers in input are integer and lie between 1 and 100 inclusively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only output line should contain an integer, denoting the minimum bitcoins Master Yang should spend in order to win.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 2 1\n1 100 1\n1 100 100\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n100 100 100\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, prices for ATK and DEF are extremely high. Master Yang can buy 99 HP, then he can beat the monster with 1 HP left.\n\nFor the second sample, Master Yang is strong enough to beat the monster, so he doesn't need to buy anything.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
