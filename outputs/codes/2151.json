But if you will divide it into parts $[65, 4]$ then it will be bad division because $65 > 4$. If $s=123$ then you can divide it into parts $[1, 23]$, $[1, 2, 3]$ but not into parts $[12, 3]$.\n\nYour task is to find any suitable division for each of the $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of the $i$-th query contains one integer number $n_i$ ($2 \\le n_i \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of digits in the $i$-th query.\n\nThe second line of the $i$-th query contains one string $s_i$ of length $n_i$ consisting only of digits from $1$ to $9$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the sequence of digits in the $i$-th query cannot be divided into at least two parts in a way described in the problem statement, print the single line \"NO\" for this query.\n\nOtherwise in the first line of the answer to this query print \"YES\", on the second line print $k_i$ \u2014 the number of parts in your division of the $i$-th query sequence and in the third line print $k_i$ strings $t_{i, 1}, t_{i, 2}, \\dots, t_{i, k_i}$ \u2014 your division. Parts should be printed in order of the initial string digits. It means that if you write the parts one after another without changing their order then you'll get the string $s_i$.\n\nSee examples for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n6\n654321\n4\n1337\n2\n33\n4\n2122\n\nOutput\nYES\n3\n6 54 321\nYES\n3\n1 3 37\nNO\nYES\n2\n21 22\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
