As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nHe describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number $k$, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases $j$, $2 \\leq j \\leq k$, in that range.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of three space-separated integers: $a$, $b$, and $k$. The input satisfies the following constraints:\\[ 0 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 2000000, \\\\ 2 \\leq k \\leq 100000. \\]\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the quantity of numbers between $a$ and $b$ inclusive which are palindromes in every base $j$, for $2 \\leq j \\leq k$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1 356 2\nSample Output:\n36\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
