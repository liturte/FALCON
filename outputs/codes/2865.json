At any point of time, each vehicle is either stopped or is moving at the extremely slow speed of $1$ meter per second. Lately, vehicles come equipped with a simple \u201cblack box\u201d that record all changes in a vehicle\u2019s speed. In this problem, speeds change instantaneously. \n\nThe road is modelled as the real line (units in meters). So a car is identified with its position on the line. Also, cars are $4.4$ meters long.\n\nGiven initial positions of two cars that are driving along the real line in the positive direction and a transcript of their speed changes, did these cars ever collide? While such a collision would be very slow speed (a \u201cbumper tap\u201d), any collision could result in erroneous readings from the black box in the future so the portions of the transcripts after a collision might not make sense.\n\n-----Input-----\nThere is only one test case. The first line contains two integers $0 \\leq X_1, X_2 \\leq 10^6$ indicating the initial positions of the rears of the two vehicles in meters. You are guaranteed either $X_1 + 5 \\leq X_2$ or $X_2 + 5 \\leq X_1$. Initially (at time $0$), the two cars are stopped.\n\nThe second line begins with a number $0 \\leq N_1 \\leq 10^5$ indicating the number of times the speed of the first car changed. The rest of the line contains $N_1$ integers $0 < T_1 < T_2 < \\ldots < T_{n_1} \\leq 10^6$ indicating the times (in seconds) the first vehicle changed speeds. So at time $T_1$ it begins driving at $1$ m/s, at time $T_2$ it stops, at time $T_3$ it begins driving at $1$ m/s, and so on.\n\nThe last line begins with a number $0 \\leq N_2 \\leq 10^5$ and is followed by $N_2$ integers $0 < T\u2019_1 < T\u2019_2 < \\ldots < T\u2019_{n_2} \\leq 10^6$ that describe the times the second vehicle starts and stops.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the vehicles collide, output the message bumper tap at time $S$ on a single line where $S$ is the number of seconds from time $0$ that the vehicles first collide, rounded up to the nearest second. If the vehicles do not collide, output the message safe and sound on a single line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n0 5\n3 1 4 5\n3 1 4 6\nSample Output 1:\nbumper tap at time 6\n\nSample Input 2:\n10 0\n2 1 2\n1 1\nSample Output 2:\nbumper tap at time 8\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
