They plan to sail from (s_{x}, s_{y}) to (e_{x}, e_{y}). However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows in one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is currently at (x, y).  If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to (x + 1, y).  If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to (x, y - 1).  If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to (x - 1, y).  If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to (x, y + 1). \n\nAlternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at (x, y). Given the wind direction for t seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to (e_{x}, e_{y})?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains five integers t, s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^5,  - 10^9 \u2264 s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} \u2264 10^9). The starting location and the ending location will be different.\n\nThe second line contains t characters, the i-th character is the wind blowing direction at the i-th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: \"E\" (east), \"S\" (south), \"W\" (west) and \"N\" (north).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf they can reach (e_{x}, e_{y}) within t seconds, print the earliest time they can achieve it. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 0 0 1 1\nSESNW\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n10 5 3 3 6\nNENSWESNEE\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, they can stay at seconds 1, 3, and move at seconds 2, 4.\n\nIn the second sample, they cannot sail to the destination.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
