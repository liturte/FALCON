The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output two positive integers $a$ and $b$, such that $a + b = n$ and $LCM(a, b)$ is the minimum possible.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n4\n6\n9\n\nOutput\n2 2\n3 3\n3 6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case, the numbers we can choose are $1, 3$ or $2, 2$. $LCM(1, 3) = 3$ and $LCM(2, 2) = 2$, so we output $2 \\ 2$.\n\nFor the second test case, the numbers we can choose are $1, 5$, $2, 4$, or $3, 3$. $LCM(1, 5) = 5$, $LCM(2, 4) = 4$, and $LCM(3, 3) = 3$, so we output $3 \\ 3$.\n\nFor the third test case, $LCM(3, 6) = 6$. It can be shown that there are no other pairs of numbers which sum to $9$ that have a lower $LCM$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
