There are n commodities produced by the company. For each of them there is exactly one integer in the final report, that denotes corresponding revenue. Before the report gets to Blake, it passes through the hands of m managers. Each of them may reorder the elements in some order. Namely, the i-th manager either sorts first r_{i} numbers in non-descending or non-ascending order and then passes the report to the manager i + 1, or directly to Blake (if this manager has number i = m).\n\nEmployees of the \"Blake Technologies\" are preparing the report right now. You know the initial sequence a_{i} of length n and the description of each manager, that is value r_{i} and his favourite order. You are asked to speed up the process and determine how the final report will look like.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of commodities in the report and the number of managers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (|a_{i}| \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the initial report before it gets to the first manager.\n\nThen follow m lines with the descriptions of the operations managers are going to perform. The i-th of these lines contains two integers t_{i} and r_{i} ($t_{i} \\in \\{1,2 \\}$, 1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n), meaning that the i-th manager sorts the first r_{i} numbers either in the non-descending (if t_{i} = 1) or non-ascending (if t_{i} = 2) order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n integers\u00a0\u2014 the final report, which will be passed to Blake by manager number m.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n1 2 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\n2 1 3 \nInput\n4 2\n1 2 4 3\n2 3\n1 2\n\nOutput\n2 4 1 3 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the initial report looked like: 1 2 3. After the first manager the first two numbers were transposed: 2 1 3. The report got to Blake in this form.\n\nIn the second sample the original report was like this: 1 2 4 3. After the first manager the report changed to: 4 2 1 3. After the second manager the report changed to: 2 4 1 3. This report was handed over to Blake.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
