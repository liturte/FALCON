She has been working on multiple projects throughout the past year. Luckily most of the projects concluded successfully, and she came up with $n$ candidate papers. However not all of the papers were born equal\u2014some have better results than others. Her advisor believes she should only submit the papers with \u201cgood enough\u201d results so they have a high chance of getting accepted. \n\nAngela\u2019s research group has a unique way of evaluating the success of paper submissions. They use the research productivity index, defined as $a^{a/s}$, where $s$ is the total number of papers submitted, and $a$ is the number of papers that are accepted by the conference. When $a = 0$, the index is defined to be zero. For example:\n - if one paper is submitted and it gets accepted, the index is $1^{1/1} = 1$;\n - if $4$ papers are submitted and all get accepted, the index is $4^{4/4} = 4$;\n - if $10$ papers are submitted and $3$ get accepted, the index is $3^{3/10} \\approx 1.390389$;\n - if $5$ papers are submitted and $4$ get accepted, the index is $4^{4/5} \\approx 3.031433$;\n - if $3$ papers are submitted and all get rejected ($a=0$), the index is $0$.\n\nIntuitively, to get a high research productivity index one wants to get as many papers accepted as possible while keeping the acceptance rate high.\n\nFor each of her $n$ papers, Angela knows exactly how likely it is that the conference would accept the paper. If she chooses wisely which papers to submit, what is the maximum expected value of her research productivity index?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input has a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$), the number of Angela\u2019s candidate papers. The next line has $n$ space-separated integers giving the probability of each paper getting accepted. Each probability value is given as an integer percentage between $1$ and $100$, inclusive.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum expected value of Angela\u2019s research productivity index. Your answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of no more than $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n30 50 70 60 90\nSample Output 1:\n2.220889579\n\nSample Input 2:\n6\n30 90 30 90 30 90\nSample Output 2:\n2.599738456\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
