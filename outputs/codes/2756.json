In Minecraft Dungeons, players crawl through a dungeon, trying to accomplish a mission without getting killed by various mobs. At the end, a boss battle with the Arch-Illager awaits.\n\nFortunately, the mobs\u2019 AI isn\u2019t particularly strong, so with some planning, it\u2019s possible to avoid the mobs. In this problem, you\u2019re given a dungeon map and you need to find out if it\u2019s possible for the player to reach the exit without being blown up by a creeper.\n\nYou, the player, can move north, south, east, and west, except where there are obstacles. The player may also stay put. There is one creeper on the map. The player and the creeper take turns simultaneously, subject to the following simple AI:\n - The creeper will only try to move towards the player, either horizontally or vertically, in a way that reduces the horizontal or vertical distance.\n - If an obstacle prevents the creeper from moving vertically, it will try to move horizontally, and vice versa.\n - If it can\u2019t move in either direction, it will stay put.\n - If the creeper can move both horizontally and vertically, it will choose the direction in which it is farther away from the player. In the case of a tie, it will move vertically towards the player.\n\nAfter each such turn, the game checks if the creeper is too close to the player, in which case the creeper will explode and kill the player, even if the player has already reached the exit in that move. Obstacles do not protect the player from explosions. If the player did not explode and reached the exit, the mission is completed.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 30$), $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 30$), and $e$ ($1 \\le e \\le \\min (n, m)$). $e$ specifies the creeper\u2019s explosion \u201cradius\u201d - the creeper will explode if both the horizontal and the vertical distance between player and creeper is less than or equal to $e$.\n\nThe following $n$ lines consist of $m$ characters each and describe the dungeon map using the following characters\n - P - the start position of the player\n - C - the start position of the creeper\n - E - the position of the exit\n - X - an obstacle\n - . - an empty square that can be entered by both creeper and player\n\nThere is exactly one of \u2018E\u2019, \u2018P\u2019, and \u2018C\u2018 each in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to complete the mission and reach the exit without being blown up by the creeper, output the minimum number of moves necessary to escape. A move consists of either the player or the creeper moving, or both. If it is not possible to escape, print \u201cyou're toast\u201d!\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n20 20 3\n....................\n...X................\n.X.X....X.....X.....\n.X.X....X....XX.....\n.X.X..........X.....\n.X.X....XXXXXXXXXXX.\n.XXXXXXX............\n.X..................\n.X...XXXXX.XXXX.XX..\n.X..P............C..\n.X.XX.X.XX.XXX..XX..\n.X.X................\n.X.XXXX....X........\n.X.X.......X........\n.X.X.......X........\n.X.X........X.......\n.X.X...X....XX......\n.X.X...X.....XX.....\n.X.X...X......XX....\n.......X...........E\nSample Output 1:\n119\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 5 1\nE...C\n.....\nXXXX.\n.....\nP....\nSample Output 2:\nyou're toast\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
