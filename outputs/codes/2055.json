Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and $n$ cities in a circle around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the $i$-th city contains $a_i$ households that require a connection.\n\nThe government designed a plan to build $n$ network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the $i$-th network station will provide service only for the $i$-th and the $(i + 1)$-th city (the $n$-th station is connected to the $n$-th and the $1$-st city).\n\nAll network stations have capacities: the $i$-th station can provide the connection to at most $b_i$ households.\n\nNow the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not \u2014 that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station $i$ provides the connection to at most $b_i$ households.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities and stations.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of households in the $i$-th city.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the capacities of the designed stations.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print YES, if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities, or NO otherwise (case insensitive).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3\n2 3 4\n3 3 3\n3\n3 3 3\n2 3 4\n4\n2 3 4 5\n3 7 2 2\n4\n4 5 2 3\n2 3 2 7\n2\n1 1\n10 10\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case:   the first network station can provide $2$ connections to the first city and $1$ connection to the second city;  the second station can provide $2$ connections to the second city and $1$ connection to the third city;  the third station can provide $3$ connections to the third city. \n\nIn the second test case:   the $1$-st station can provide $2$ connections to the $1$-st city;  the $2$-nd station can provide $3$ connections to the $2$-nd city;  the $3$-rd station can provide $3$ connections to the $3$-rd city and $1$ connection to the $1$-st station. \n\nIn the third test case, the fourth city needs $5$ connections, but the third and the fourth station has $4$ connections in total.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
