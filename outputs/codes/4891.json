Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces should contain:\n - One king\n - One queen\n - Two rooks\n - Two bishops\n - Two knights\n - Eight pawns\n\nMirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he should add or remove to make a valid set.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of $6$ integers on a single line, each between $0$ and $10$ (inclusive). The numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should consist of $6$ integers on a single line; the number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n0 1 2 2 2 7\nSample Output:\n1 0 0 0 0 1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
