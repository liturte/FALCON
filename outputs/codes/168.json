The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.\n\nYou are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer $n$\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$).\n\nThe next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to \"-\" (without quotes) or \"+\" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to \"-\" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to \"+\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n---\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n4\n++++\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\n2\n-+\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n5\n++-++\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).\n\nIn the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.\n\nIn the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
