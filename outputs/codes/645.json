Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.\n\nTo determine this, you can flip over some cards to reveal the other side. You would like to know what is the minimum number of cards you need to flip in the worst case in order to verify that the statement is true.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input will contain a string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 50), denoting the sides of the cards that you can see on the table currently. Each character of s is either a lowercase English letter or a digit.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the minimum number of cards you must turn over to verify your claim.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nee\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\nz\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n0ay1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, we must turn over both cards. Note that even though both cards have the same letter, they could possibly have different numbers on the other side.\n\nIn the second sample, we don't need to turn over any cards. The statement is vacuously true, since you know your friend has no cards with a vowel on them.\n\nIn the third sample, we need to flip the second and fourth cards.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
