New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the $n$ days of summer. On the $i$-th day, $a_i$ millimeters of rain will fall. All values $a_i$ are distinct.\n\nThe mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather $x$ days before the celebration and $y$ days after. Because of that, he says that a day $d$ is not-so-rainy if $a_d$ is smaller than rain amounts at each of $x$ days before day $d$ and and each of $y$ days after day $d$. In other words, $a_d < a_j$ should hold for all $d - x \\le j < d$ and $d < j \\le d + y$. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such $j$ that $1 \\le j \\le n$.\n\nHelp mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $0 \\le x, y \\le 7$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ denotes the rain amount on the $i$-th day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the index of the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer. We can show that the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 2 2\n10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n10 2 3\n10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n5 5 5\n100000 10000 1000 100 10\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example days $3$ and $8$ are not-so-rainy. The $3$-rd day is earlier.\n\nIn the second example day $3$ is not not-so-rainy, because $3 + y = 6$ and $a_3 > a_6$. Thus, day $8$ is the answer. Note that $8 + y = 11$, but we don't consider day $11$, because it is not summer.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
