In his article, he proves several theorems. For every theorem, David came up with a proof. Since David is a very eager student, he even came up with multiple proofs for some of the theorems. As usual, a proof for a theorem may depend on a number of other theorems.\n\nThe article has to be as short as possible to publish it, and David only really cares about the main theorem, Theorem $0$. In order to achieve this, he has estimated the number of words he will need for every proof. Can you help David find the shortest possible length of his article?\n\n-----Input-----\n - A single line containing $1\\leq n\\leq 20$, the number of theorems.\n - For each theorem:\n - A single line containing $1\\leq p_ i\\leq 10$, the number of proofs for the $i$th theorem.\n - $p_ i$ lines, each of the form $l$, $k$, $d_0,\\dots ,d_{k-1}$, where $0\\leq l\\leq 10^6$ is the length of the proof, $0\\leq k\\leq n-1$ is the number of theorems the proof depends on, and the $0\\leq d_ i\\leq n-1$ are the numbers of the theorems the proof depends on.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint one line with a single integer, the shortest possible length of David\u2019s article.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2\n2\n10 0\n3 1 1\n1\n4 1 0\nSample Output:\n10\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
