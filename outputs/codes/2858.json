This game is not about winning, it\u2019s about los taking part, like in competitions.\n\nTo solve this task, you don\u2019t need to know the rules of mafia: all you need to know is that some of the players are \u201cmobsters\u201d and the rest are \u201ccivilians\u201d. The mobsters know who is who, but the civilians don\u2019t. The civilians are trying to figure out who the mobsters are during the game.\n\nIn the current round of the game, out of $N$ surviving players so far, each one has accused exactly one other player saying that he is the mobster. The civilians were only guessing and the mobsters have accused civilians, pretending to know nothing.\n\nNot knowing who the mobsters are, but knowing who accused whom, determine the maximum possible number of mobsters among these players!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 500000$), the number of players. The players are labeled with integers from $1$ to $N$.\n\nThe $K$-th line of input, out of the following $N$ lines, contains the label of the player accused by the player $K$. (No player can accuse themselves).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the maximum possible number of mobsters.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2\n1\n1\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n2\n3\n1\nSample Output 2:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
