Now Ivan can't remember this array, but the bug he was trying to fix didn't go away, so Ivan thinks that the data from this array might help him to reproduce the bug.\n\nIvan clearly remembers that there were n elements in the array, and each element was not less than 1 and not greater than n. Also he remembers q facts about the array. There are two types of facts that Ivan remembers:  1 l_{i} r_{i} v_{i} \u2014 for each x such that l_{i} \u2264 x \u2264 r_{i} a_{x} \u2265 v_{i};  2 l_{i} r_{i} v_{i} \u2014 for each x such that l_{i} \u2264 x \u2264 r_{i} a_{x} \u2264 v_{i}. \n\nAlso Ivan thinks that this array was a permutation, but he is not so sure about it. He wants to restore some array that corresponds to the q facts that he remembers and is very similar to permutation. Formally, Ivan has denoted the cost of array as follows:\n\n$\\operatorname{cos} t = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\\operatorname{cnt}(i))^{2}$, where cnt(i) is the number of occurences of i in the array.\n\nHelp Ivan to determine minimum possible cost of the array that corresponds to the facts!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 100).\n\nThen q lines follow, each representing a fact about the array. i-th line contains the numbers t_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i} and v_{i} for i-th fact (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 n, t_{i} denotes the type of the fact).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the facts are controversial and there is no array that corresponds to them, print -1. Otherwise, print minimum possible cost of the array.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3 1\n1 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n3 2\n1 1 3 2\n2 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n3 2\n1 1 3 2\n2 1 3 1\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
