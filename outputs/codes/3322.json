And, like any fancy party, you need to buy some fancy antiques to put up around the venue (your house).\n\nThere is a set of $n$ fancy antiques that you need to buy. And there is a set of $m$ fancy antique shops in the city. Because these antiques are extremely rare, each fancy antique can only be found at a single fancy antique shop. However, the fancy antique shops can also sell \u201cknock-off\u201d (duplicate) versions of some of the antiques. And of course, for any fancy antique, there is only a single fancy antique shop in the city that holds a knock-off version of that antique (this is to maintain the rareness of the antiques). The shop that sells the original is not always the same shop that holds the knock-off.\n\nIt turns out that even though you can tell the difference, most people cannot tell the original version from the knock-off version of any given antique. And, because the shops can get away with it, sometimes the knock-off is more expensive than the original! Since the party is tomorrow, you only have time to visit $k$ shops. You would like to buy one version (either the original or the knock-off) of each of the $n$ antiques.\n\nSuppose that there are three shops, and three antiques we would like to buy.\n - Antique $\\# 1$ sells for $30$ at shop $\\# 1$. Its knockoff sells for $50$ at shop $\\# 2$.\n - Antique $\\# 2$ sells for $70$ at shop $\\# 2$. Its knockoff sells for $10$ at shop $\\# 3$.\n - Antique $\\# 3$ sells for $20$ at shop $\\# 3$. Its knockoff sells for $80$ at shop $\\# 1$.\n\nSuppose you only have time to go to two shops. You can go to shops $1$ and $3$. You can buy the original of antique $1$ with cost $30$ at shop $1$, the original of antique $3$ with cost $20$ at shop $3$, and the knock-off of antique $2$ at shop $3$ with cost $10$. The total cost to buy these items is $60$, which is the minimum possible.\n\nIf you only have time to visit one shop, then it is impossible. You cannot buy a version of all three items by visiting a single shop.\n\nGiven the costs of the antiques/knock-offs at the shops, what is the minimum total cost to buy one version of each antique?\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will consist of three space-separated integers: $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le k \\le m \\le 40$). The next $n$ lines will each have four space separated integers, $a$, $p$, $b$ and $q$, describing an antique, where:\n - $a$ is the index of the shop that sells the original version of the antique ($1 \\le a \\le m$)\n - $p$ is the price of the original version of the antique at shop $a$ ($1 \\le p \\le 10^7$)\n - $b$ is the index of the shop that sells the knock-off version of the antique ($1 \\le b \\le m$)\n - $q$ is the price of the knock-off version of the antique at shop $b$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^7$)\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to collect all of the antiques while visiting no more than $k$ stores, then output the minimum cost. If it is not possible, output $-1$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3 2\n1 30 2 50\n2 70 3 10\n3 20 1 80\nSample Output:\n60\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
