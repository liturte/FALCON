In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than h he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the i-th person is equal to a_{i}.\n\nConsider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 h \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2h), the i-th of them is equal to the height of the i-th person.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible valid width of the road.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 7\n4 5 14\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n6 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n6 5\n7 6 8 9 10 5\n\nOutput\n11\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, only person number 3 must bend down, so the required width is equal to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nIn the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 is enough.\n\nIn the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
