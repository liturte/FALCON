Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.\n\nYou may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \\times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \\le x < n$ and $1 \\le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.\n\nYour goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.\n\nIs it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n, m \\le 50$).\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ \u2014 the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \\le k \\le 2500$ should hold.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n1 1\n1 2\n2 2\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 0 1\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 2\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe sequence of operations in the first example: $\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
