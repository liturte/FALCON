The boy wants to read the textbook to prepare for the Olympics. He counted that he needed k hours for this. He also found that the light in the train changes every hour. The light is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is very dark, and 100 is very light.\n\nVasya has a train lighting schedule for all n hours of the trip \u2014 n numbers from 0 to 100 each (the light level in the first hour, the second hour and so on). During each of those hours he will either read the whole time, or not read at all. He wants to choose k hours to read a book, not necessarily consecutive, so that the minimum level of light among the selected hours were maximum. Vasya is very excited before the upcoming contest, help him choose reading hours.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first input line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of hours on the train and the number of hours to read, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100), a_{i} is the light level at the i-th hour.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first output line print the minimum light level Vasya will read at. In the second line print k distinct space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k}, \u2014 the indexes of hours Vasya will read at (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 n). The hours are indexed starting from 1. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. Print the numbers b_{i} in an arbitrary order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n20 10 30 40 10\n\nOutput\n20\n1 3 4 \n\nInput\n6 5\n90 20 35 40 60 100\n\nOutput\n35\n1 3 4 5 6 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Vasya should read at the first hour (light 20), third hour (light 30) and at the fourth hour (light 40). The minimum light Vasya will have to read at is 20.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
