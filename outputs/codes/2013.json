Initially, $k$ chips are placed on the board, $i$-th chip is located in the cell at the intersection of $sx_i$-th row and $sy_i$-th column.\n\nIn one action, Petya can move all the chips to the left, right, down or up by $1$ cell.\n\nIf the chip was in the $(x, y)$ cell, then after the operation:   left, its coordinates will be $(x, y - 1)$;  right, its coordinates will be $(x, y + 1)$;  down, its coordinates will be $(x + 1, y)$;  up, its coordinates will be $(x - 1, y)$. \n\nIf the chip is located by the wall of the board, and the action chosen by Petya moves it towards the wall, then the chip remains in its current position.\n\nNote that several chips can be located in the same cell.\n\nFor each chip, Petya chose the position which it should visit. Note that it's not necessary for a chip to end up in this position.\n\nSince Petya does not have a lot of free time, he is ready to do no more than $2nm$ actions.\n\nYou have to find out what actions Petya should do so that each chip visits the position that Petya selected for it at least once. Or determine that it is not possible to do this in $2nm$ actions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n, m, k$ ($1 \\le n, m, k \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the board and the number of chips, respectively.\n\nThe next $k$ lines contains two integers each $sx_i, sy_i$ ($ 1 \\le sx_i \\le n, 1 \\le sy_i \\le m$) \u2014 the starting position of the $i$-th chip.\n\nThe next $k$ lines contains two integers each $fx_i, fy_i$ ($ 1 \\le fx_i \\le n, 1 \\le fy_i \\le m$) \u2014 the position that the $i$-chip should visit at least once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the number of operations so that each chip visits the position that Petya selected for it at least once.\n\nIn the second line output the sequence of operations. To indicate operations left, right, down, and up, use the characters $L, R, D, U$ respectively.\n\nIf the required sequence does not exist, print -1 in the single line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 2\n1 2\n2 1\n3 3\n3 2\n\nOutput\n3\nDRD\nInput\n5 4 3\n3 4\n3 1\n3 3\n5 3\n1 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\n9\nDDLUUUURR\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
