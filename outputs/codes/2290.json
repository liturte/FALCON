Nodes are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThe graph is considered harmonious if and only if the following property holds:  For every triple of integers $(l, m, r)$ such that $1 \\le l < m < r \\le n$, if there exists a path going from node $l$ to node $r$, then there exists a path going from node $l$ to node $m$. \n\nIn other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node $l$ we can reach a node $r$ through edges ($l < r$), then we should able to reach nodes $(l+1), (l+2), \\ldots, (r-1)$ too.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious? \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \\le n \\le 200\\ 000$ and $1 \\le m \\le 200\\ 000$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of edges we have to add to the graph to make it harmonious.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n14 8\n1 2\n2 7\n3 4\n6 3\n5 7\n3 8\n6 8\n11 12\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n200000 3\n7 9\n9 8\n4 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the given graph is not harmonious (for instance, $1 < 6 < 7$, node $1$ can reach node $7$ through the path $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 7$, but node $1$ can't reach node $6$). However adding the edge $(2, 4)$ is sufficient to make it harmonious.\n\nIn the second example, the given graph is already harmonious.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
