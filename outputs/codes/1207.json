In her new gig as a reporter, Bessie needs to know about programming competition results as quickly as possible. When she covers the 2016 Robot Rap Battle Tournament, she notices that all of the robots operate under deterministic algorithms. In particular, robot i will beat robot j if and only if robot i has a higher skill level than robot j. And if robot i beats robot j and robot j beats robot k, then robot i will beat robot k. Since rapping is such a subtle art, two robots can never have the same skill level.\n\nGiven the results of the rap battles in the order in which they were played, determine the minimum number of first rap battles that needed to take place before Bessie could order all of the robots by skill level.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers, the number of robots n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) and the number of rap battles m ($1 \\leq m \\leq \\operatorname{min}(100000, \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2})$).\n\nThe next m lines describe the results of the rap battles in the order they took place. Each consists of two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i}), indicating that robot u_{i} beat robot v_{i} in the i-th rap battle. No two rap battles involve the same pair of robots.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one ordering of the robots satisfies all m relations.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum k such that the ordering of the robots by skill level is uniquely defined by the first k rap battles. If there exists more than one ordering that satisfies all m relations, output -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n2 1\n1 3\n2 3\n4 2\n4 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3 2\n1 2\n3 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the robots from strongest to weakest must be (4, 2, 1, 3), which Bessie can deduce after knowing the results of the first four rap battles.\n\nIn the second sample, both (1, 3, 2) and (3, 1, 2) are possible orderings of the robots from strongest to weakest after both rap battles.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
