They noted the time when each of them flashed. They further noticed that each of the stars flashes periodically, at regular intervals, and now they are wondering: on what day, at what hour will the stars flash at the same minute for the first time?\n\nFor example, if the first star flashed today (Saturday) at $02$:$20$ and the second one at $13$:$00$, with the first star flashing every $05$:$50$ (every $5$ hours and $50$ minutes) and the second every $01$:$00$ (each hour), then the first one will flash again at $08$:$10$ and $14$:$00$, and the second one at $14$:$00$. Therefore, both stars will have flashed at the same minute today at $14$:$00$.\n\nNote that the time $00$:$00$ (midnight) is the first minute of a day.\n\n-----Input-----\nFour lines containing four timestamps in $HH$:$MM$ format (hours:minutes), with $00 \\le HH \\le 23$, $00 \\le MM \\le 59$.\n\nThe timestamps are, in order: the time of the first star\u2019s flash, the time of the second star\u2019s flash, the time between consecutive flashes of the first star, the time between consecutive flashes of the second star.\n\nThe first two timestamps will differ, and both fall on the same day \u2013 Saturday. Flash intervals will not be 00:00.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the stars will never flash at the same minute, output \u201cNever\u201d in a single line.\n\nOtherwise, output in the first line the name of the weekday of the first same-minute flash. A reminder on the correct spelling of weekdays: \u201cSunday\u201d, \u201cMonday\u201d, \u201cTuesday\u201d, \u201cWednesday\u201d, \u201cThursday\u201d, \u201cFriday\u201d and \u201cSaturday\u201d.\n\nIn the second line, output the timestamp of the first same-minute flash, in $HH$:$MM$ format (with a leading zero for $HH$ and $MM$ if they are less than $10$).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n02:20\n13:00\n05:50\n01:00\nSample Output 1:\nSaturday\n14:00\n\nSample Input 2:\n02:20\n23:28\n00:40\n23:50\nSample Output 2:\nNever\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
