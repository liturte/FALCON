Each of these has to come from a different country. There are $N$ countries, and the $i$th country has $a_ i$ tennis players and $b_ i$ umpires. (Nobody can be both a player and an umpire.) How many different tennis matches are possible? Two tennis matches are different if the sets of involved people are different.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$, where $3 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$. The following $N$ lines each contain two integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ with $0 \\leq a_ i, b_ i \\leq 10^6$. You can assume $\\sum _{i=1}^N a_ i \\leq 10^6$ and $\\sum _{i=1}^N b_ i \\leq 10^6$.\n\n-----Output-----\nA single integer, the number of possible different tennis matches.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample 1-----\nAssume the players from the first country are called $A_1$ and $A_2$, the players from the second country are called $B_1$ and $B_2$, and the umpire from the third country is called $C$. Then there are $4$ matches where $C$ is the umpire: $\\{ A_1, B_1, C\\} $, $\\{ A_1, B_2, C\\} $, $\\{ A_2, B_1, C\\} $, and $\\{ A_2, B_2, C\\} $. Similarly, there are $8$ matches with the other umpires. In total, there are $12$ possible different matches.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n2 1\n2 1\n2 1\nSample Output:\n12\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
