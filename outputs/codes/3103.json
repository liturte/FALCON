On his way back to the castle one day, the engines capable of turning the sails failed. As it is a full-rigged ship, he and his crew are now unable to turn the sails in any direction.\n\nBut, as luck would have it, there is a south wind which is blowing them in the right direction\u2026at least approximately. Since they may not get to the castle by wind only, Lysias believes he can use the ocean\u2019s currents to move the ship either east or west temporarily by retracting and lowering the ship\u2019s sails. In that way, the ship can move in two potential directions:\n - Move north by lowering the sails\n - Retract the sails and move in the direction of the current they\u2019re on top of (east/west)\n\nLysias has dug up an old map of all the currents in this part of the ocean. As he is fond of mathematics, not only does Lysias wonder if it\u2019s possible to get home without fixing the sails; he also wonders how many different routes they can take to get home. Can you help him?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line has three integers: $Y$ and $X$ and $x_{init}$, representing the number of rows and columns of the map, and which column the ship is currently placed at. The ship always starts on the bottom row.\n\nThen follow $Y$ rows, each with $X$ characters each. All characters $C_{x,y}$ is one of \u2018~\u2019, \u2018#\u2019, \u2018@\u2019, \u2018>\u2019 and \u2018<\u2019. \u2019~\u2019 represents open sea without any currents, \u2018#\u2019 is impassable shallow waters, and \u2018>\u2019 and \u2018<\u2019 are currents moving the boat to the right and left respectively. \u2018@\u2019 represents Lysias\u2019 castle.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput all the different distinct paths the ship could take to get back to the castle. Since there may be very many different ways to get back, output the answer modulo $1000003$.\n\nIf there are no ways to get to the castle, output \u201cbegin repairs\u201d.\n\n-----Limits-----\n - $0 < Y \\leq 300$\n - $0 \\leq x_{init} < X \\leq 50000$\n - If $C_{x,y} = \\text {\u2018>\u2019}$, then $x+1 < X$ and $C_{x+1,y} \\notin \\{ \\text {\u2018<\u2019}, \\verb|`#'|\\} $\n - If $C_{x,y} = \\text {\u2018<\u2019}$, then $0 \\leq x-1$ and $C_{x-1,y} \\notin \\{ \\text {\u2018>\u2019}, \\verb|`#'|\\} $\n - There is exactly one \u2018@\u2019 tile on the map\n - The boat will not start on a `#' tile\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 2 0\n>@\n>~\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 5 1\n>>@<<\n>~#~<\n>>>>~\nSample Output 2:\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
