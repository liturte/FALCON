The dog wants to eat the gopher, while the gopher wants to run to safety through one of several gopher holes dug in the surface of the field.\n\nNeither the dog nor the gopher is a math major; however, neither is entirely stupid. The gopher decides on a particular gopher hole and heads for that hole in a straight line at a fixed speed. The dog, which is very good at reading body language, anticipates which hole the gopher has chosen, and heads at double the speed of the gopher to the hole, where it intends to gobble up the gopher. If the dog reaches the hole first, the gopher gets gobbled; otherwise, the gopher escapes.\n\nYou have been retained by the gopher to select a hole through which it can escape, if such a hole exists.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains four real numbers: the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the gopher followed by the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the dog. Subsequent lines of input each contain two real numbers: the $(x,y)$ coordinates of a gopher hole. All coordinates are in metres, with exactly three digits after the decimal point.\n\nThere are not more than $1000$ gopher holes and all coordinates are between $-10000$ and $+10000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nYour output should consist of a single line. If the gopher can escape the line should read \u201cThe gopher can escape through the hole at ($x$,$y$).\u201d identifying the appropriate hole.\n\nOtherwise the output line should read \u201cThe gopher cannot escape.\u201d If the gopher may escape through more than one hole, any one will do. If the gopher and dog reach the hole at the same time, the gopher escapes successfully.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1.000 1.000 2.000 2.000\n1.500 1.500\nSample Output:\nThe gopher cannot escape.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
