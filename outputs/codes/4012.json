You can perform such operation any (possibly, zero) number of times, you can even perform this operation several times with one number. Note that you cannot make non-positive numbers using such operations.\n\nYou have to perform the minimum number of such operations in order to obtain three integers $A \\le B \\le C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line as three space-separated integers $a, b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a \\le b \\le c \\le 10^4$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer. In the first line print $res$ \u2014 the minimum number of operations you have to perform to obtain three integers $A \\le B \\le C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$. On the second line print any suitable triple $A, B$ and $C$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n8\n1 2 3\n123 321 456\n5 10 15\n15 18 21\n100 100 101\n1 22 29\n3 19 38\n6 30 46\n\nOutput\n1\n1 1 3\n102\n114 228 456\n4\n4 8 16\n6\n18 18 18\n1\n100 100 100\n7\n1 22 22\n2\n1 19 38\n8\n6 24 48\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
