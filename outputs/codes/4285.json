Let's replace each question mark with one of the letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". Here we can obtain all $3^{k}$ possible strings consisting only of letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". For example, if $s = $\"ac?b?c\" then we can obtain the following strings: $[$\"acabac\", \"acabbc\", \"acabcc\", \"acbbac\", \"acbbbc\", \"acbbcc\", \"accbac\", \"accbbc\", \"accbcc\"$]$.\n\nYour task is to count the total number of subsequences \"abc\" in all resulting strings. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\nA subsequence of the string $t$ is such a sequence that can be derived from the string $t$ after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. For example, the string \"baacbc\" contains two subsequences \"abc\" \u2014 a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(2, 5, 6)$ and a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(3, 5, 6)$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ $(3 \\le n \\le 200\\,000)$ \u2014 the length of $s$.\n\nThe second line of the input contains the string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" and question marks\"?\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the total number of subsequences \"abc\" in all strings you can obtain if you replace all question marks with letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\", modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\nac?b?c\n\nOutput\n24\n\nInput\n7\n???????\n\nOutput\n2835\n\nInput\n9\ncccbbbaaa\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n5\na???c\n\nOutput\n46\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we can obtain $9$ strings:  \"acabac\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"acabbc\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"acabcc\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"acbbac\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"acbbbc\" \u2014 there are $3$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"acbbcc\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"accbac\" \u2014 there is $1$ subsequence \"abc\",  \"accbbc\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \"abc\",  \"accbcc\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \"abc\". \n\nSo, there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 24$ subsequences \"abc\" in total.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
