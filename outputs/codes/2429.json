He knows that $n$ is even.\n\nHe wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly $\\frac{n}{2}$ coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is minimized. Formally, let $a$ denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and $b$ denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize $|a-b|$, the absolute value of $a-b$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 30$; $n$ is even)\u00a0\u2014 the number of coins that Phoenix has. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible difference of weights between the two piles.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n2\n4\n\nOutput\n2\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, Phoenix has two coins with weights $2$ and $4$. No matter how he divides the coins, the difference will be $4-2=2$.\n\nIn the second test case, Phoenix has four coins of weight $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$. It is optimal for Phoenix to place coins with weights $2$ and $16$ in one pile, and coins with weights $4$ and $8$ in another pile. The difference is $(2+16)-(4+8)=6$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
