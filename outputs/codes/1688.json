The playlist consists of $n$ tracks numbered from $1$ to $n$. The playlist is automatic and cyclic: whenever track $i$ finishes playing, track $i+1$ starts playing automatically; after track $n$ goes track $1$.\n\nFor each track $i$, you have estimated its coolness $a_i$. The higher $a_i$ is, the cooler track $i$ is.\n\nEvery morning, you choose a track. The playlist then starts playing from this track in its usual cyclic fashion. At any moment, you remember the maximum coolness $x$ of already played tracks. Once you hear that a track with coolness strictly less than $\\frac{x}{2}$ (no rounding) starts playing, you turn off the music immediately to keep yourself in a good mood.\n\nFor each track $i$, find out how many tracks you will listen to before turning off the music if you start your morning with track $i$, or determine that you will never turn the music off. Note that if you listen to the same track several times, every time must be counted.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$), denoting the number of tracks in the playlist.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), denoting coolnesses of the tracks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$, where $c_i$ is either the number of tracks you will listen to if you start listening from track $i$ or $-1$ if you will be listening to music indefinitely.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n11 5 2 7\n\nOutput\n1 1 3 2\n\nInput\n4\n3 2 5 3\n\nOutput\n5 4 3 6\n\nInput\n3\n4 3 6\n\nOutput\n-1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, here is what will happen if you start with...   track $1$: listen to track $1$, stop as $a_2 < \\frac{a_1}{2}$.  track $2$: listen to track $2$, stop as $a_3 < \\frac{a_2}{2}$.  track $3$: listen to track $3$, listen to track $4$, listen to track $1$, stop as $a_2 < \\frac{\\max(a_3, a_4, a_1)}{2}$.  track $4$: listen to track $4$, listen to track $1$, stop as $a_2 < \\frac{\\max(a_4, a_1)}{2}$. \n\nIn the second example, if you start with track $4$, you will listen to track $4$, listen to track $1$, listen to track $2$, listen to track $3$, listen to track $4$ again, listen to track $1$ again, and stop as $a_2 < \\frac{max(a_4, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_1)}{2}$. Note that both track $1$ and track $4$ are counted twice towards the result.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
