The reason is that each of them has already mastered exactly one ball trick \u2013 either the Triple Spin, or the Power Charge. For convenience, we call the former trick 1 and the latter trick 2. These two tricks are extremely effective in attack.\n\nBesides mastering such powerful trick, each of them also knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick. Therefore, one of their popular training routines is to let two players play against each other, one using a trick and the other trying to defend against it. We call this a move. The one who uses a trick is called an attacker, and the other is called a defender.\n\nRB\u2019s team can perform sequences of moves. To state it more concisely, we use the notation $(\\text {Attacker}, \\text {Defender})$ to represent a move. Suppose the current move is $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B})$. A performs the only trick he knows.\n - If A attacks successfully (i.e., B fails to defend), the next move will normally be $(\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\n - However, if it is the third consecutive time A attacks successfully, A will have to take a rest for the next two moves and the next move will be $(\\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D})$ for some other players C and D.\n - If A fails (i.e., B defends successfully), the next move will be $(\\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\n\nNote that in all cases, A, B, C, and D must be pairwise distinct players. In addition, C and D must not be at rest for the next move.\n\n\nToday, RB inspects the team training. He is interested in sequences of moves of length exactly $N$. How many different sequences of moves of length $N$ are there? Two sequences of moves\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1, \\mathrm{DEF}_1), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2, \\mathrm{DEF}_2), \\ldots , (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N)) \\]\n\nand\\[ ((\\mathrm{ATK}_1^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_1^{'}), (\\mathrm{ATK}_2^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_2^{'}), \\ldots , (\\mathrm{ATK}_ N^{'}, \\mathrm{DEF}_ N^{'})) \\]\n\nare considered different if and only if for some $i$, $\\mathrm{ATK}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{ATK}_ i^{'}$ or $\\mathrm{DEF}_ i \\neq \\mathrm{DEF}_ i^{'}$.\n\nSince the number may be too large, output it modulo $1000000007$ ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input consists of five non-negative integers, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{22}$, and $N$. $a_{ij}$ denotes the number of players in RB\u2019s team who knows how to perform skill $i$ and how to defend against skill $j$.\n\nFor all test cases, $1 \\leq a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{21} + a_{22} \\leq 5000$, $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of length-$N$ sequences of moves, modulo $1000000007$.\n\n-----Explanation-----\nFor Sample case 1, let $A$, $B$, $C$ be the players. Then valid sequences include:\n - $((A, B), (B, C), (C, A))$\n - $((A, C), (C, B), (B, A))$\n - $((B, A), (A, C), (C, B))$\n - $((B, C), (C, A), (A, B))$\n - $((C, A), (A, B), (B, C))$\n - $((C, B), (B, A), (A, C))$\n\nFor Sample case 2, let $A, B, C$ be the players, where $A$ is the player who can defend against skill 1. Then valid sequences include:\n - $((B, C), (B, A), (A, C), (A, B), (A, C))$\n - $((C, B), (C, A), (A, B), (A, C), (A, B))$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 0 0 0 3\nSample Output 1:\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 2 0 0 5\nSample Output 2:\n2\n\nSample Input 3:\n1 2 0 0 4\nSample Output 3:\n4\n\nSample Input 4:\n1 2 0 0 6\nSample Output 4:\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
