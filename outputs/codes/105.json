The chessboard you are given is not necesserily $8 \\times 8$, but it still is $N \\times N$. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from $1$ to $N^2$ and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The $j$-th square in the $i$-th row has a number $A_{ij}$ written on it.\n\nIn your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number $1$ (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square $2$ (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square $3$ and so on until you reach square $N^2$. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.\n\nA knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.\n\nYou want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal. Among all the paths to have the same number of steps you want to choose the one with the lowest number of piece replacements.\n\nWhat is the path you should take to satisfy all conditions?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $N$ ($3 \\le N \\le 10$) \u2014 the size of the chessboard.\n\nEach of the next $N$ lines contains $N$ integers $A_{i1}, A_{i2}, \\dots, A_{iN}$ ($1 \\le A_{ij} \\le N^2$) \u2014 the numbers written on the squares of the $i$-th row of the board.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all $A_{ij}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line should contain two integers \u2014 the number of steps in the best answer and the number of replacement moves in it.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n1 9 3\n8 6 7\n4 2 5\n\nOutput\n12 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nHere are the steps for the first example (the starting piece is a knight):  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(1, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Replace the knight with a rook  Move to $(3, 1)$  Move to $(3, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(2, 2)$  Move to $(2, 3)$  Move to $(2, 1)$  Move to $(1, 1)$  Move to $(1, 2)$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
