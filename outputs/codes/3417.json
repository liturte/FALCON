An independent set of $G$ is called a maximum independent set if there is no independent set in $G$ with strictly more vertices. Given a specific kind of connected graph $G$, find the size of a maximum independent set of $G$.\n\n-----Input-----\n - The input starts with one line, containing integers $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$), the number of vertices in the graph, and $m$ ($n-1 \\leq m \\leq n + 15$), the number of edges in the graph.\n - Then follow $m$ lines, each containing integers $a, b$ ($1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$) indicating that there is an edge between vertices $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe graph given by this input is guaranteed to be both simple and connected: there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, there are no loops, and there is a path between each pair of vertices.\n\n-----Output-----\n - Output the number of vertices in a maximum independent set of the input graph.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 1\n1 2\nSample Output:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
