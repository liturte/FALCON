He will enter the time of the \u201cexplosion\u201d into the microprocessor, and it will drop the sodium in the water after the time is up.\n\nBorko knows the current time and when he wants the explosion. He is not very fond of arithmetic and Zvonko is currently playing with marbles in his back yard so he can\u2019t help him.\n\nWrite a program that calculates the time to the explosion (this is the time Borko will enter into the microprocessor). The time Borko wants is at least one second and at most 24 hours.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the current time in hh:mm:ss format (hours, minutes, seconds). The hours will be between $0$ and $23$ (inclusive) and the minutes and seconds between $0$ and $59$. The second line contains the time of the explosion in the same format.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the desired time on a single line, in the same format as the times in the input.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n20:00:00\n04:00:00\nSample Output:\n08:00:00\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
