Malek wants to keep her happy for n days. In order to be happy in i-th day, she needs to eat exactly a_{i} kilograms of meat. [Image] \n\nThere is a big shop uptown and Malek wants to buy meat for her from there. In i-th day, they sell meat for p_{i} dollars per kilogram. Malek knows all numbers a_1, ..., a_{n} and p_1, ..., p_{n}. In each day, he can buy arbitrary amount of meat, also he can keep some meat he has for the future.\n\nMalek is a little tired from cooking meat, so he asked for your help. Help him to minimize the total money he spends to keep Duff happy for n days. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of days.\n\nIn the next n lines, i-th line contains two integers a_{i} and p_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, p_{i} \u2264 100), the amount of meat Duff needs and the cost of meat in that day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum money needed to keep Duff happy for n days, in one line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 3\n2 2\n3 1\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n3\n1 3\n2 1\n3 2\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case: An optimal way would be to buy 1 kg on the first day, 2 kg on the second day and 3 kg on the third day.\n\nIn the second sample case: An optimal way would be to buy 1 kg on the first day and 5 kg (needed meat for the second and third day) on the second day.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
