Not everyone who is eligible to compete onsite can afford to travel to the office, though. Initially the top 25 contestants are invited to come onsite. Each eligible contestant must either accept or decline the invitation. Whenever a contestant declines, the highest ranked contestant not yet invited is invited to take the place of the one that declined. This continues until 25 contestants have accepted invitations.\n\nAfter the qualifying round completes, you know K of the onsite finalists, as well as their qualifying ranks (which start at 1, there are no ties). Determine the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite in the final round.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains K (1 \u2264 K \u2264 25), the number of onsite finalists you know. The second line of input contains r_1, r_2, ..., r_{K} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 10^6), the qualifying ranks of the finalists you know. All these ranks are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n25\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5\n16 23 8 15 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\n14 15 92\n\nOutput\n67\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you know all 25 onsite finalists. The contestants who ranked 1-st, 13-th, and 27-th must have declined, so the answer is 3.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
