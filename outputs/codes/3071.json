That is, each player should play $(m-1) \\cdot n$ games. \n\nThe playing schedule should be divided into rounds. A player can play at most one game per round. If a player does not play a game in a round, that player is said to have a bye in that round.\n\nYour task is to write a program that constructs a playing schedule so that no player has a bye in more than $1$ round. In other words, the total number of rounds in the playing schedule should be no more than $(m-1) \\cdot n + 1$.\n\nThe order of the rounds and games, and who is home and away in a game, does not matter.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line with two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 25$, $2 \\le m \\le 25$, $n \\cdot m \\le 100$), the number of players in a team and the total number of teams, respectively.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line per round in the playing schedule. Each line should contain a space separated list of games. A game is in the format \u201c<player>-<player>\u201d. The players in the first team are denoted as $\\texttt{A}1, \\texttt{A}2, ..., \\texttt{A}n$; the second team $\\texttt{B}1, \\texttt{B}2, \\ldots \\texttt{B}n$ and so on.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\nSample Output 1:\nA1-B2 B1-A2 A3-B3\nA2-B3 B2-A3 A1-B1\nA3-B1 B3-A1 A2-B2\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\nSample Output 2:\nA1-B1 A2-C2 B2-C1\nA1-C1 A2-B1 B2-C2\nA1-B2 A2-C1 B1-C2\nA1-C2 A2-B2 B1-C1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
