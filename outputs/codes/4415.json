And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers $[y_1 > y_2 > \\dots > y_l]$. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\n\nThey were merged into one sequence $a$. After that sequence $a$ got shuffled. For example, some of the possible resulting sequences $a$ for an increasing sequence $[1, 3, 4]$ and a decreasing sequence $[10, 4, 2]$ are sequences $[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 10]$ or $[4, 2, 1, 10, 4, 3]$.\n\nThis shuffled sequence $a$ is given in the input.\n\nYour task is to find any two suitable initial sequences. One of them should be strictly increasing and the other one \u2014 strictly decreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\n\nIf there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements in $a$.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $a$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\" in the first line.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" in the first line and any two suitable sequences. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\n\nIn the second line print $n_i$ \u2014 the number of elements in the strictly increasing sequence. $n_i$ can be zero, in this case the increasing sequence is empty.\n\nIn the third line print $n_i$ integers $inc_1, inc_2, \\dots, inc_{n_i}$ in the increasing order of its values ($inc_1 < inc_2 < \\dots < inc_{n_i}$) \u2014 the strictly increasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $n_i = 0$ (or just print the empty line).\n\nIn the fourth line print $n_d$ \u2014 the number of elements in the strictly decreasing sequence. $n_d$ can be zero, in this case the decreasing sequence is empty.\n\nIn the fifth line print $n_d$ integers $dec_1, dec_2, \\dots, dec_{n_d}$ in the decreasing order of its values ($dec_1 > dec_2 > \\dots > dec_{n_d}$) \u2014 the strictly decreasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $n_d = 0$ (or just print the empty line).\n\n$n_i + n_d$ should be equal to $n$ and the union of printed sequences should be a permutation of the given sequence (in case of \"YES\" answer).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n7 2 7 3 3 1 4\n\nOutput\nYES\n2\n3 7 \n5\n7 4 3 2 1 \n\nInput\n5\n4 3 1 5 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n1\n3 \n4\n5 4 3 1 \n\nInput\n5\n1 1 2 1 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n5\n0 1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\nYES\n0\n\n5\n4 3 2 1 0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
