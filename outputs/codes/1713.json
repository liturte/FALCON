Petya's got n non-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from 1 to n from left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.\n\nFirst Petya puts a marble under the glass in position s. Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to position p_1, the glass from the second position to position p_2 and so on. That is, a glass goes from position i to position p_{i}. Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.\n\nAfter all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to position t. Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from position s to position t.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers: n, s, t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5;\u00a01 \u2264 s, t \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position. The second line contains n space-separated integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the shuffling operation parameters. It is guaranteed that all p_{i}'s are distinct.\n\nNote that s can equal t.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the marble can move from position s to position t, then print on a single line a non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to position t. If it is impossible, print number -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2 1\n2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4 3 3\n4 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4 3 4\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 1 3\n2 1 3\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
