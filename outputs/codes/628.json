He decided that the beauty of the $k$ shelves is the bitwise AND of the values of all the shelves.\n\nHe also decided that he won't spend time on reordering the books, so he will place several first books on the first shelf, several next books on the next shelf and so on. Of course, he will place at least one book on each shelf. This way he will put all his books on $k$ shelves in such a way that the beauty of the shelves is as large as possible. Compute this maximum possible beauty.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of books and the number of shelves in the new office.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$, ($0 < a_i < 2^{50}$)\u00a0\u2014 the prices of the books in the order they stand on the old shelf.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible beauty of $k$ shelves in the new office.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 4\n9 14 28 1 7 13 15 29 2 31\n\nOutput\n24\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 14 15 92 65 35 89\n\nOutput\n64\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can split the books as follows:\n\n$$(9 + 14 + 28 + 1 + 7) \\& (13 + 15) \\& (29 + 2) \\& (31) = 24.$$\n\nIn the second example you can split the books as follows:\n\n$$(3 + 14 + 15 + 92) \\& (65) \\& (35 + 89) = 64.$$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
