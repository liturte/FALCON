For every $i \\in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \\in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. \n\nYou have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.\n\nFrom the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) \u2014 only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) \u2014 only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) \u2014 only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) \u2014 only if j > 1.\n\nNotice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the integers in the cells on your path.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf all possible values of x and y such that 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.\n\nOtherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8\n1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2\n\nOutput\nYES\n3 3\n\nInput\n6\n1 2 1 2 5 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n2\n1 10\n\nOutput\nYES\n4 9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] \n\nAlso there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
