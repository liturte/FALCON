This usage is continuous. That is, in \u03bb seconds, the device will use \u03bb\u00b7a_{i} units of power. The i-th device currently has b_{i} units of power stored. All devices can store an arbitrary amount of power.\n\nYou have a single charger that can plug to any single device. The charger will add p units of power per second to a device. This charging is continuous. That is, if you plug in a device for \u03bb seconds, it will gain \u03bb\u00b7p units of power. You can switch which device is charging at any arbitrary unit of time (including real numbers), and the time it takes to switch is negligible.\n\nYou are wondering, what is the maximum amount of time you can use the devices until one of them hits 0 units of power.\n\nIf you can use the devices indefinitely, print -1. Otherwise, print the maximum amount of time before any one device hits 0 power.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers, n and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of devices and the power of the charger.\n\nThis is followed by n lines which contain two integers each. Line i contains the integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the power of the device and the amount of power stored in the device in the beginning.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf you can use the devices indefinitely, print -1. Otherwise, print the maximum amount of time before any one device hits 0 power.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 4}.\n\nNamely, let's assume that your answer is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-4}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1\n2 2\n2 1000\n\nOutput\n2.0000000000\nInput\n1 100\n1 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 5\n4 3\n5 2\n6 1\n\nOutput\n0.5000000000\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn sample test 1, you can charge the first device for the entire time until it hits zero power. The second device has enough power to last this time without being charged.\n\nIn sample test 2, you can use the device indefinitely.\n\nIn sample test 3, we can charge the third device for 2 / 5 of a second, then switch to charge the second device for a 1 / 10 of a second.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
