One of the strategies is to sell cans of food in packs with discounts. \n\nSuppose you decided to sell packs with $a$ cans in a pack with a discount and some customer wants to buy $x$ cans of cat food. Then he follows a greedy strategy:   he buys $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor$ packs with a discount;  then he wants to buy the remaining $(x \\bmod a)$ cans one by one. \n\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} \\right\\rfloor$ is $x$ divided by $a$ rounded down, $x \\bmod a$ is the remainer of $x$ divided by $a$.\n\nBut customers are greedy in general, so if the customer wants to buy $(x \\bmod a)$ cans one by one and it happens that $(x \\bmod a) \\ge \\frac{a}{2}$ he decides to buy the whole pack of $a$ cans (instead of buying $(x \\bmod a)$ cans). It makes you, as a marketer, happy since the customer bought more than he wanted initially.\n\nYou know that each of the customers that come to your shop can buy any number of cans from $l$ to $r$ inclusive. Can you choose such size of pack $a$ that each customer buys more cans than they wanted initially?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the range of the number of cans customers can buy.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print YES if you can choose such size of pack $a$ that each customer buys more cans than they wanted initially. Otherwise, print NO.\n\nYou can print each character in any case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 4\n1 2\n120 150\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, you can take, for example, $a = 5$ as the size of the pack. Then if a customer wants to buy $3$ cans, he'll buy $5$ instead ($3 \\bmod 5 = 3$, $\\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$). The one who wants $4$ cans will also buy $5$ cans.\n\nIn the second test case, there is no way to choose $a$.\n\nIn the third test case, you can take, for example, $a = 80$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
