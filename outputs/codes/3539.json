In the Bipartite Battle, Bash and Socket play a game with Bipartite Graphs.\n\nThe Bipartite Battle happens as follows:\n - Socket draws $N$ bipartite graphs. The $i$-th graph has $2$ sets of vertices, one with $a_ i$ vertices, and the other with $b_ i$ vertices.\n - Then the $2$ players, Bash and Socket alternatively take turns. In each turn, a player must choose exactly one non-empty graph, then delete exactly one edge or exactly one vertex of the chosen graph. If the player deletes one vertex, all edges adjacent to it are also deleted.\n - The player who cannot move loses. Note that this can only happen when all edges and all vertices of all graphs have been deleted.\n - Bash plays first.\n\nOf course, Socket does not want to play fair. Socket plans to draw bipartite graphs such that he always wins.\n\nHow many ways can Socket draw $N$ bipartite graphs, so that he always wins, assuming both players play optimally?\n\n-----Notes-----\nFor the $i$-th bipartite graph, let\u2019s number the vertices in first set from $1$ to $a_ i$, and the vertices in second set from $1$ to $b_ i$.\n\nAn edge connecting vertex $u$ in first set and vertex $v$ in second set is denoted as $(u, v)$.\n\nTwo drawings of bipartite graphs are considered different iff there exists an index $j$ and a pair of integers $(u, v)$, such that:\n - $(u, v)$ is an edge of $j$-th graph in one drawing.\n - $(u, v)$ is NOT an edge of $j$-th graph in the other drawing.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ $(1 \\le N \\le 10^5)$.\n\n$N$ lines follow, each line contains exactly $2$ space-separated integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$$(1 \\le a_ i, b_ i \\le 10^9)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint exactly one integer \u2014 the number of ways Socket can draw $N$ bipartite graphs, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\n1 1\nSample Output:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
