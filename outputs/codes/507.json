In particular, one of the nights impressed her deeply, giving her the illusion that all her fancies would be realized.\n\nOn that night, Sengoku constructed a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} of integers from 1 to n inclusive, with each integer representing a colour, wishing for the colours to see in the coming meteor outburst. Two incredible outbursts then arrived, each with n meteorids, colours of which being integer sequences a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} and b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} respectively. Meteoroids' colours were also between 1 and n inclusive, and the two sequences were not identical, that is, at least one i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) exists, such that a_{i} \u2260 b_{i} holds.\n\nWell, she almost had it all \u2014 each of the sequences a and b matched exactly n - 1 elements in Sengoku's permutation. In other words, there is exactly one i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) such that a_{i} \u2260 p_{i}, and exactly one j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) such that b_{j} \u2260 p_{j}.\n\nFor now, Sengoku is able to recover the actual colour sequences a and b through astronomical records, but her wishes have been long forgotten. You are to reconstruct any possible permutation Sengoku could have had on that night.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the length of Sengoku's permutation, being the length of both meteor outbursts at the same time.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the first meteor outburst.\n\nThe third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the second meteor outburst. At least one i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) exists, such that a_{i} \u2260 b_{i} holds.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput n space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, denoting a possible permutation Sengoku could have had. If there are more than one possible answer, output any one of them.\n\nInput guarantees that such permutation exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 3\n1 2 5 4 5\n\nOutput\n1 2 5 4 3\n\nInput\n5\n4 4 2 3 1\n5 4 5 3 1\n\nOutput\n5 4 2 3 1\n\nInput\n4\n1 1 3 4\n1 4 3 4\n\nOutput\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, both 1, 2, 5, 4, 3 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are acceptable outputs.\n\nIn the second sample, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1 is the only permutation to satisfy the constraints.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
