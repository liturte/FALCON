Three operations can be performed as follows:\n - First, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {15, 6, 2}.\n - Next, multiply a_1 by 3, divide a_2 by 2 and multiply a_3 by 3. The sequence is now {45, 3, 6}.\n - Finally, multiply a_1 by 3, multiply a_2 by 3 and divide a_3 by 2. The sequence is now {135, 9, 3}.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
