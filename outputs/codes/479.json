Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.\n\nFor example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.\n\nLet's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 20).\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers a_{i} follow in the strictly increasing order.\n\nThe next line contains integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 20) \u2014 the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.\n\nThe next q lines contain numbers x_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 2\u00b710^8) \u2014 the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 20\n10 50 100 500 1000 5000\n8\n4200\n100000\n95000\n96000\n99000\n10100\n2015\n9950\n\nOutput\n6\n20\n19\n20\n-1\n3\n-1\n-1\n\nInput\n5 2\n1 2 3 5 8\n8\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
