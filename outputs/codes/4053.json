He picked some string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. \n\nYou don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $1$ to $n-1$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nIvan wants you to guess which of the given $2n-2$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the length of the guessed string $s$.\n\nThe next $2n-2$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $1$ to $n-1$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are exactly $2$ strings of each length from $1$ to $n-1$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one string of length $2n-2$ \u2014 the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $i$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $i$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nOutput\nSPPSPSPS\n\nInput\n3\na\naa\naa\na\n\nOutput\nPPSS\n\nInput\n2\na\nc\n\nOutput\nPS\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".\n\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.\n\nIn the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
