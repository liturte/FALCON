Now they want to divide these candies as fair as possible. To do this, Alice takes one pile of candies, then Bob takes one of the other two piles. The last pile is split between Alice and Bob as they want: for example, it is possible that Alice takes the whole pile, and Bob gets nothing from it.\n\nAfter taking the candies from the piles, if Alice has more candies than Bob, she discards some candies so that the number of candies she has is equal to the number of candies Bob has. Of course, Bob does the same if he has more candies.\n\nAlice and Bob want to have as many candies as possible, and they plan the process of dividing candies accordingly. Please calculate the maximum number of candies Alice can have after this division process (of course, Bob will have the same number of candies).\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\nLet's see the following example: $[1, 3, 4]$. Then Alice can choose the third pile, Bob can take the second pile, and then the only candy from the first pile goes to Bob\u00a0\u2014 then Alice has $4$ candies, and Bob has $4$ candies.\n\nAnother example is $[1, 10, 100]$. Then Alice can choose the second pile, Bob can choose the first pile, and candies from the third pile can be divided in such a way that Bob takes $54$ candies, and Alice takes $46$ candies. Now Bob has $55$ candies, and Alice has $56$ candies, so she has to discard one candy\u00a0\u2014 and after that, she has $55$ candies too.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.\n\nThe only line of the query contains three integers $a, b$ and $c$ ($1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^{16}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of candies in the first, second and third piles correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain the answer for the $i$-th query\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice can have after the division, if both Alice and Bob act optimally (of course, Bob will have the same number of candies).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1 3 4\n1 10 100\n10000000000000000 10000000000000000 10000000000000000\n23 34 45\n\nOutput\n4\n55\n15000000000000000\n51\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
