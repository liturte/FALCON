To succeed, he needs to traverse the labyrinthine volcanic tunnels, avoiding the treacherous elements and making it from chamber to chamber as quickly as possible.\n\nThe cave has $N$ chambers and $M$ tunnels connecting these chambers; no tunnel connects a chamber to itself, and there is at most one tunnel between any two chambers. This cave has a special property: it is known that it is possible to travel between any two different chambers by taking one or more tunnels, and that there are at most two paths between any two different chambers that do not take any tunnel more than once.\n\nFor simplicity, we label the chambers $1, 2, \\dots , N$; then, the $i^\\text {th}$ tunnel connects chambers $A_ i$ and $B_ i$, and has a length of $L_ i$ meters.\n\nSpike can travel at the fast, fast speed of $1$ meter per second. He wants to know the danger level of each chamber. The danger level of a chamber is simply the sum of the times, in seconds, required to travel from this chamber to every other chamber, assuming that one always takes the shortest path possible.\n\nHelp Spike determine the danger level of each chamber!\n\nSince these numbers can be quite large, you should output only the remainders after dividing each number by $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers, $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 200000$) and $M$ ($N-1 \\leq M \\leq 400000$) the number of chambers and tunnels in the cave.\n\nThe next $M$ lines contain the descriptions of the tunnels. In particular, the $i^\\text {th}$ of these lines contains three integers $A_ i$, $B_ i$ ($1\\leq A_ i, B_ i \\leq N$; $A_ i \\neq B_ i$) and $L_ i$ ($1 \\leq L_ i \\leq 10^9$), denoting that the $i^\\text {th}$ tunnel connects chambers $A_ i$ and $B_ i$, and has a length of $L_ i$ meters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one tunnel between any two chambers, that it is possible to travel between any two different chambers by taking one or more tunnels, and that there are at most two paths between any two chambers that do not take any tunnel more than once.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $N$ integers on a single line, separated by spaces. The $i^\\text {th}$ of these integers should contain the danger level of chamber $i$.\n\nSince these numbers can be quite large, you should output only the remainders after dividing each number by $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 5\n1 2 3\n1 4 8\n2 3 12\n3 5 4\n4 5 2\nSample Output:\n35 39 36 27 29\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
