Traditionally fair consists of $n$ booths, arranged in a circle. The booths are numbered $1$ through $n$ clockwise with $n$ being adjacent to $1$. The $i$-th booths sells some candies for the price of $a_i$ burles per item. Each booth has an unlimited supply of candies.\n\nPolycarp has decided to spend at most $T$ burles at the fair. However, he has some plan in mind for his path across the booths:  at first, he visits booth number $1$;  if he has enough burles to buy exactly one candy from the current booth, then he buys it immediately;  then he proceeds to the next booth in the clockwise order (regardless of if he bought a candy or not). \n\nPolycarp's money is finite, thus the process will end once he can no longer buy candy at any booth.\n\nCalculate the number of candies Polycarp will buy.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le T \\le 10^{18}$) \u2014 the number of booths at the fair and the initial amount of burles Polycarp has.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the price of the single candy at booth number $i$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the total number of candies Polycarp will buy.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 38\n5 2 5\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n5 21\n2 4 100 2 6\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example. Here are Polycarp's moves until he runs out of money:  Booth $1$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 33$;  Booth $2$, buys candy for $2$, $T = 31$;  Booth $3$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 26$;  Booth $1$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 21$;  Booth $2$, buys candy for $2$, $T = 19$;  Booth $3$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 14$;  Booth $1$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 9$;  Booth $2$, buys candy for $2$, $T = 7$;  Booth $3$, buys candy for $5$, $T = 2$;  Booth $1$, buys no candy, not enough money;  Booth $2$, buys candy for $2$, $T = 0$. \n\nNo candy can be bought later. The total number of candies bought is $10$.\n\nIn the second example he has $1$ burle left at the end of his path, no candy can be bought with this amount.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
