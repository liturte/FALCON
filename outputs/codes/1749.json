Vasya exhibited all his cubes in a row. So the sequence of numbers written on the cubes in the order from the left to the right equals to a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.\n\nWhile Vasya was walking, his little brother Stepan played with Vasya's cubes and changed their order, so now the sequence of numbers written on the cubes became equal to b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. \n\nStepan said that he swapped only cubes which where on the positions between l and r, inclusive, and did not remove or add any other cubes (i. e. he said that he reordered cubes between positions l and r, inclusive, in some way).\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible that Stepan said the truth, or it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, l, r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of Vasya's cubes and the positions told by Stepan.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes in the Vasya's order.\n\nThe third line contains the sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes after Stepan rearranged their order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Stepan did not remove or add other cubes, he only rearranged Vasya's cubes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"LIE\" (without quotes) if it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother. In the other case, print \"TRUTH\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 4\n3 4 2 3 1\n3 2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\nTRUTH\n\nInput\n3 1 2\n1 2 3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\nLIE\n\nInput\n4 2 4\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\nTRUTH\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there is a situation when Stepan said the truth. Initially the sequence of integers on the cubes was equal to [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. Stepan could at first swap cubes on positions 2 and 3 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 4, 3, 1]), and then swap cubes in positions 3 and 4 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 3, 4, 1]).\n\nIn the second example it is not possible that Stepan said truth because he said that he swapped cubes only between positions 1 and 2, but we can see that it is guaranteed that he changed the position of the cube which was on the position 3 at first. So it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\n\nIn the third example for any values l and r there is a situation when Stepan said the truth.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
