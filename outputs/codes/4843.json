Remember that, in chess, queens can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), which means the eight queens would have to be laid out in such a way that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nThis puzzle actually has multiple solutions. The following is one possible solution:\n\nFinding the solutions to the \u201ceight queens puzzle\u201d is actually an interesting computational problem. However, that\u2019s not the problem you will be solving here. Instead, you will be solving a much simpler problem: given a proposed solution to the puzzle, you must verify whether it is a valid solution (i.e., whether no queen can attack another queen).\n\nWhen referring to specific squares on the board, we will assume that the bottom-left square is the $(0,0)$ square, and that the $x$ coordinate increases as you move right, and the $y$ coordinate increases as you move up.\n\nIn other words, something like this:\n\nFurthermore, we will consider the more general \u201c$N$-queens puzzle\u201d, where the chessboard can have $N\\times N$ squares, and there will be $N$ queens on the board. For example, this would be a correct solution to the 4-queens puzzle:\n\nAnd this would be an incorrect solution to the 4-queens puzzle:\n\nNotice how the queen in (2,2) can attack the queen in (0,2) and the queen in (2,3).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with a line containing a single integer: the value of $N$ ($0 < N \\le 5000$). This is followed by $N$ lines, each containing the position of a queen as two integers: $x$ and $y$ (separated by a single space), where $0 \\le x, y < N$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains either CORRECT if the positions of the queens is a solution to the $N$-queens puzzle, and INCORRECT otherwise.\n\nNote that the sample data presented below corresponds to the three boards shows earlier.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n8\n1 5\n6 2\n3 1\n5 0\n4 6\n0 3\n2 7\n7 4\nSample Output 1:\nCORRECT\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n2 3\n1 0\n0 2\n3 1\nSample Output 2:\nCORRECT\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
