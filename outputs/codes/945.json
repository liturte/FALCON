One day Dima had a date with his girl and he asked Seryozha to leave the room. As a compensation, Seryozha made Dima do his homework.\n\nThe teacher gave Seryozha the coordinates of n distinct points on the abscissa axis and asked to consecutively connect them by semi-circus in a certain order: first connect the first point with the second one, then connect the second point with the third one, then the third one with the fourth one and so on to the n-th point. Two points with coordinates (x_1, 0) and (x_2, 0) should be connected by a semi-circle that passes above the abscissa axis with the diameter that coincides with the segment between points. Seryozha needs to find out if the line on the picture intersects itself. For clarifications, see the picture Seryozha showed to Dima (the left picture has self-intersections, the right picture doesn't have any). [Image] \n\nSeryozha is not a small boy, so the coordinates of the points can be rather large. Help Dima cope with the problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3). The second line contains n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} ( - 10^6 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the i-th point has coordinates (x_{i}, 0). The points are not necessarily sorted by their x coordinate.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print \"yes\" (without the quotes), if the line has self-intersections. Otherwise, print \"no\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n0 10 5 15\n\nOutput\nyes\n\nInput\n4\n0 15 5 10\n\nOutput\nno\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test from the statement is on the picture to the left, the second test is on the picture to the right.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
