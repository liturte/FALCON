Many sequences may look random but upon closer inspection we can find hidden regularities in the occurrence of the numbers. For example, consider the following $100$-digit \u201crandom\u201d sequence starting with $4, 7, 9, \\ldots $:\n\n  4 7 9 5 9 3 5 0 0 1 7 8 5 0 2 6 3 5 4 4 4 6 3 3 2 7 1 8 7 8 7 6 1 1 7 2 5 4 7 2 0 4 4 5 8 3 0 6 9 3 2 6 6 8 5 2 5 1 2 7 2 4 1 0 0 4 9 1 8 7 5 0 4 4 8 4 3 2 6 8 8 5 6 7 0 9 7 0 3 6 1 4 4 1 2 3 2 6 9 9\n\nIf you look closely, whenever a $4$ is followed immediately by another $4$, the third value after this will be a $3$ (we\u2019re sure you saw that). We\u2019ll call features like this triple correlations and we\u2019ll represent it as $4(1)4(3)3$, where the numbers in parentheses indicate how far away each number on either side of the parentheses must be. More precisely, a sequence of $p$ digits has an $a(n)b(m)c$ triple correlation if\n - any time there is an $a$ followed $n$ locations later by a $b$ there is always a $c$ located $m$ locations after the $b$ unless $b$\u2019s location is within distance $m-1$ of the end of the sequence.\n - any time there is a $b$ followed $m$ locations later by a $c$ there is always an $a$ located $n$ locations before the $b$ unless $b$\u2019s location is within distance $n-1$ of the beginning of the sequence.\n - any time there is an $a$ followed $n+m$ locations later by a $c$ there is always a $b$ located $n$ locations after the $a$.\n - the correlation occurs at least $\\lceil p/40 \\rceil + 1$ times, where $\\lceil x \\rceil $ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n\nSuch correlations are tough to spot in general, so that\u2019s where we need your help. You will be given a sequence of digits and must search it for triple correlations.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput starts with a positive integer $p$ ($p \\leq 1000$) indicating the number of random digits in the sequence. Starting on the next line will be the $p$ digits, separated by spaces and potentially spread across multiple lines. No line will contain more than $100$ digits and there will be no blank lines.\n\n-----Output-----\nDisplay triple correlation a(n)b(m)c found if it occurs in the list (with the appropriate values for a, b, c, n, and m filled in) or the phrase random sequence otherwise. If there are multiple triple correlations in the sequence, display the one which begins earliest in the sequence. If there is still a tie, choose the one with the smaller value of n, and if there is still a tie, choose the one with the smaller value of m.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n100\n4 7 9 5 9 3 5 0 0 1 7 8 5 0 2 6 3 5 4 4\n4 6 3 3 2 7 1 8 7 8 7 6 1 1 7 2 5 4 7 2\n0 4 4 5 8 3 0 6 9 3 2 6 6 8 5 2 5 1 2 7\n2 4 1 0 0 4 9 1 8 7 5 0 4 4 8 4 3 2 6 8\n8 5 6 7 0 9 7 0 3 6 1 4 4 1 2 3 2 6 9 9\nSample Output:\ntriple correlation 4(1)4(3)3 found\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
