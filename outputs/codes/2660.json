There are two kinds of queries, update queries and evaluation queries, as follows:\n - An update query 1 a b: Given two integers a and b, let g(x) = f(x) + |x - a| + b and replace f(x) with g(x).\n - An evaluation query 2: Print x that minimizes f(x), and the minimum value of f(x). If there are multiple such values of x, choose the minimum such value.\nWe can show that the values to be output in an evaluation query are always integers, so we ask you to print those values as integers without decimal points.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq Q \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - -10^9 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9\n - The first query is an update query.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nQ\nQuery_1\n:\nQuery_Q\n\nSee Sample Input 1 for an example.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each evaluation query, print a line containing the response, in the order in which the queries are given.\nThe response to each evaluation query should be the minimum value of x that minimizes f(x), and the minimum value of f(x), in this order, with space in between.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4\n1 4 2\n2\n1 1 -8\n2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n4 2\n1 -3\n\nIn the first evaluation query, f(x) = |x - 4| + 2, which attains the minimum value of 2 at x = 4.\nIn the second evaluation query, f(x) = |x - 1| + |x - 4| - 6, which attains the minimum value of -3 when 1 \\leq x \\leq 4.
