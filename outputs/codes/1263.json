That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. \n\nDima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, $\\frac{\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} a_{j}}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_{j}} = k$ , where a_{j} is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and b_{j} is its calories.\n\nInna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem \u2014 now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!\n\nInna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste a_{i} and calories b_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n10 8 1\n2 7 1\n\nOutput\n18\n\nInput\n5 3\n4 4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition $\\frac{18}{9} = 2 = k$ fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.\n\nIn the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
