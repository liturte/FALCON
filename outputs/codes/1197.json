Some of the squares contain bombs. If a square doesn't contain a bomb, then it contains a number from 0 to 2 \u2014 the total number of bombs in adjacent squares.\n\nFor example, the correct field to play looks like that: 001*2***101*. The cells that are marked with \"*\" contain bombs. Note that on the correct field the numbers represent the number of bombs in adjacent cells. For example, field 2* is not correct, because cell with value 2 must have two adjacent cells with bombs.\n\nValera wants to make a correct field to play \"Minesweeper 1D\". He has already painted a squared field with width of n cells, put several bombs on the field and wrote numbers into some cells. Now he wonders how many ways to fill the remaining cells with bombs and numbers are there if we should get a correct field in the end.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains sequence of characters without spaces s_1s_2... s_{n} (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6), containing only characters \"*\", \"?\" and digits \"0\", \"1\" or \"2\". If character s_{i} equals \"*\", then the i-th cell of the field contains a bomb. If character s_{i} equals \"?\", then Valera hasn't yet decided what to put in the i-th cell. Character s_{i}, that is equal to a digit, represents the digit written in the i-th square.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways Valera can fill the empty cells and get a correct field.\n\nAs the answer can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n?01???\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n?\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n**12\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test sample you can get the following correct fields: 001**1, 001***, 001*2*, 001*10.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
