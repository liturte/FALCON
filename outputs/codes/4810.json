Knowing Ivica\u2019s e-letter travels unguarded through the network on its way to Marica\u2019s e-mailbox, they have decided to encrypt every message using the following algorithm:\n - Suppose Ivica\u2019s message consists of $N$ characters.\n - Ivica must first find a matrix consisting of $R$ rows and $C$ columns such that $R \\le C$ and $R \\cdot C = N$. If there is more than one such matrix, Ivica chooses the one with the most rows.\n - Ivica writes his message into the matrix in row-major order. In other words, he writes the first segment of the message into the first row, the second segment into the second row and so on.\n - The message he sends to Marica is the matrix read in column-major order.\n\nFor instance, suppose Ivica wants to send the message \u201cbombonisuuladici\u201d containing 16 letters. He can use a $1 \\times 16$, $2 \\times 8$, or $4 \\times 4$ matrix. Of these, the $4 \\times 4$ has the most rows. When the message is written into it, the matrix looks like this, and the encrypted message becomes \u201cboudonuimilcbsai\u201d.\n\nb\n\no\n\nm\n\nb\n\no\n\nn\n\ni\n\ns\n\nu\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nd\n\ni\n\nc\n\ni\n\nMarica has grown tired of spending her precious time deciphering Ivica\u2019s messages, so you must write a program to do it for her.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains the received message, a string of lowercase letters of the English alphabet (with no spaces). The number of letters will be between 1 and 100.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the original (decrypted) message.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nbok\nSample Output 1:\nbok\n\nSample Input 2:\nkoaski\nSample Output 2:\nkakosi\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
