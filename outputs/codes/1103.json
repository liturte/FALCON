He took n cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding 8 written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n  the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 8 in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then 1 from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are c_{k} cards with number k on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers $i \\in [ 1,8 ], j \\in [ 1,8 ]$ the condition |c_{i} - c_{j}| \u2264 1 must hold.  if there is at least one card with number x on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number x in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence [1, 1, 2, 2] satisfies this condition while the subsequence [1, 2, 2, 1] doesn't. Note that [1, 1, 2, 2] doesn't satisfy the first condition. \n\nPlease help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cards in Vladik's sequence.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of n positive integers not exceeding 8\u00a0\u2014 the description of Vladik's sequence.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single integer\u00a0\u2014 the length of the longest subsequence of Vladik's sequence that satisfies both conditions.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n8\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n8\nInput\n24\n1 8 1 2 8 2 3 8 3 4 8 4 5 8 5 6 8 6 7 8 7 8 8 8\n\nOutput\n17\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample all the numbers written on the cards are equal, so you can't take more than one card, otherwise you'll violate the first condition.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
