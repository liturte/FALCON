Arkady thinks that red roses are not good together with white roses, so he won't buy a bouquet containing both red and white roses. Also, Arkady won't buy a bouquet where all roses have the same color. \n\nArkady wants to buy exactly k roses. For each rose in the shop he knows its beauty and color: the beauty of the i-th rose is b_{i}, and its color is c_{i} ('W' for a white rose, 'O' for an orange rose and 'R' for a red rose). \n\nCompute the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet of k roses satisfying the constraints above or determine that it is not possible to make such a bouquet.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of roses in the show and the number of roses Arkady wants to buy.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10 000), where b_{i} equals the beauty of the i-th rose.\n\nThe third line contains a string c of length n, consisting of uppercase English letters 'W', 'O' and 'R', where c_{i} denotes the color of the i-th rose: 'W' denotes white, 'O' \u00a0\u2014 orange, 'R' \u2014 red.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet of k roses that satisfies the constraints above. If it is not possible to make a single such bouquet, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n4 3 4 1 6\nRROWW\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 2\n10 20 14 20 11\nRRRRR\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n11 5\n5 6 3 2 3 4 7 5 4 5 6\nRWOORWORROW\n\nOutput\n28\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Arkady wants to buy 3 roses. He can, for example, buy both red roses (their indices are 1 and 2, and their total beauty is 7) and the only orange rose (its index is 3, its beauty is 4). This way the total beauty of the bouquet is 11. \n\nIn the second example Arkady can not buy a bouquet because all roses have the same color.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
