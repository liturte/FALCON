The result of their boredom is the creation of a new game! In the beginning of the game, they draw $N$ points in a coordinate system. The players take turns and Mirko plays first. He draws a straight line which is parallel to one of the axes of the coordinate system and passes through one of the $N$ points. In the following moves, the player draws a straight line which is parallel to one of the axes of the coordinate system and passes through one of the $N$ points located on the line drawn in the previous move of the opponent. No single line must be drawn twice. The loser is the player who cannot play his move. Determine who has the winning strategy.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10000$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, the coordinates of the points drawn ($1 \\leq X,Y \\leq 500$).\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the name of the winner, either \u201cMirko\u201d or \u201cSlavko\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\nSample Output:\nMirko\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
