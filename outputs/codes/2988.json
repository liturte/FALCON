The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!\n\nThere are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it\u2019s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \\leq n,m \\leq 200000)$, the number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow $m$ lines containing three space-separated integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $t_ i$ each $(1 \\le a_ i, b_ i \\le n, 0 \\le t_ i \\le 10000)$, which, as explained above, represent the two cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls showing on the radar. Each ID $c$ satisfies the bound $1 \\leq c \\leq n$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the Dragon Ball radar. If there is no way to complete this task, print $-1$ instead.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n10 9\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 1\n5 6 1\n6 7 1\n7 8 1\n8 9 1\n9 10 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nSample Output:\n6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
