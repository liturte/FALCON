Malek Dance Club has 2^{n} members and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has 2^{n} members. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique id i from 0 to 2^{n} - 1. The same holds for each member of NFC.\n\nOne of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers (a, b) such that member a from MDC dances with member b from NFC.\n\nThe complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a < c and b > d.\n\nYou are given a binary number of length n named x. We know that member i from MDC dances with member $i \\oplus x$ from NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\nExpression $x \\oplus y$ denotes applying \u00abXOR\u00bb to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in C++ and Java it denotes as \u00ab^\u00bb, in Pascal \u2014 \u00abxor\u00bb.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a binary number x of lenght n, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\n\nThis number may contain leading zeros.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the complexity of the given dance assignent modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n01\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
