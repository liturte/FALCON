Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?\n\nNew roads will also be one-way.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000, 0 \\le m \\le 5000, 1 \\le s \\le n$) \u2014 the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThe following $m$ lines contain roads: road $i$ is given as a pair of cities $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\ne v_i$). For each pair of cities $(u, v)$, there can be at most one road from $u$ to $v$. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $u$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $u$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city $s$.
