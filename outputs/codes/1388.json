The $i$-th node in the tree has a cost $a_i$, and binary digit $b_i$ is written in it. He wants to have binary digit $c_i$ written in the $i$-th node in the end.\n\nTo achieve this, he can perform the following operation any number of times:   Select any $k$ nodes from the subtree of any node $u$, and shuffle the digits in these nodes as he wishes, incurring a cost of $k \\cdot a_u$. Here, he can choose $k$ ranging from $1$ to the size of the subtree of $u$. \n\nHe wants to perform the operations in such a way that every node finally has the digit corresponding to its target.\n\nHelp him find the minimum total cost he needs to spend so that after all the operations, every node $u$ has digit $c_u$ written in it, or determine that it is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\n\n$i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains 3 space-separated integers $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9, 0 \\leq b_i, c_i \\leq 1)$ \u00a0\u2014 the cost of the $i$-th node, its initial digit and its goal digit.\n\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines contain two integers $u$, $v$ $(1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, \\text{ } u \\ne v)$, meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$ in the tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum total cost to make every node reach its target digit, and $-1$ if it is impossible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 0 1\n20 1 0\n300 0 1\n4000 0 0\n50000 1 0\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\n5\n10000 0 1\n2000 1 0\n300 0 1\n40 0 0\n1 1 0\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5\n\nOutput\n24000\nInput\n2\n109 0 1\n205 0 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe tree corresponding to samples $1$ and $2$ are: [Image]\n\nIn sample $1$, we can choose node $1$ and $k = 4$ for a cost of $4 \\cdot 1$ = $4$ and select nodes ${1, 2, 3, 5}$, shuffle their digits and get the desired digits in every node.\n\nIn sample $2$, we can choose node $1$ and $k = 2$ for a cost of $10000 \\cdot 2$, select nodes ${1, 5}$ and exchange their digits, and similarly, choose node $2$ and $k = 2$ for a cost of $2000 \\cdot 2$, select nodes ${2, 3}$ and exchange their digits to get the desired digits in every node.\n\nIn sample $3$, it is impossible to get the desired digits, because there is no node with digit $1$ initially.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
