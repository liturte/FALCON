We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to n. We know that each node of graph G is connected by edges with at least k other nodes of this graph. Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least k + 1.\n\nA simple cycle of length d (d > 1) in graph G is a sequence of distinct graph nodes v_1, v_2, ..., v_{d} such, that nodes v_1 and v_{d} are connected by an edge of the graph, also for any integer i (1 \u2264 i < d) nodes v_{i} and v_{i} + 1 are connected by an edge of the graph.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, k (3 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5;\u00a02 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1) \u2014 the number of the nodes of the graph, the number of the graph's edges and the lower limit on the degree of the graph node. Next m lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n;\u00a0a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}) \u2014 the indexes of the graph nodes that are connected by the i-th edge. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any multiple edges or self-loops. It is guaranteed that each node of the graph is connected by the edges with at least k other nodes of the graph.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print integer r (r \u2265 k + 1) \u2014 the length of the found cycle. In the next line print r distinct integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{r} (1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the found simple cycle.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\nOutput\n3\n1 2 3 \nInput\n4 6 3\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n4\n3 4 1 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
