You can freely choose the health of each new slime. The first reproduction of our slime will happen in one second.\nDetermine if it is possible to set the healths of our first slime and the subsequent slimes spawn so that the multiset of the healths of the 2^N slimes that will exist in N seconds equals a multiset S.\nHere S is a multiset containing 2^N (possibly duplicated) integers: S_1,~S_2,~...,~S_{2^N}.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 18\n - 1 \\leq S_i \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nS_1 S_2 ...
