It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either 0 or 1.\n\nYou may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation you are allowed to change any digit of your number; you may change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. It is possible that after some operation you can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.\n\nYou are also given two integers $0 \\le y < x < n$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number that has remainder $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $10^y$ when divided by $10^x$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n, x, y$ ($0 \\le y < x < n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the length of the number and the integers $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains one decimal number consisting of $n$ digits, each digit of this number is either 0 or 1. It is guaranteed that the first digit of the number is 1.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number having remainder $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $10^y$ when divided by $10^x$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11 5 2\n11010100101\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n11 5 1\n11010100101\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the number will be $11010100100$ after performing one operation. It has remainder $100$ modulo $100000$.\n\nIn the second example the number will be $11010100010$ after performing three operations. It has remainder $10$ modulo $100000$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
