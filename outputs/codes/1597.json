Each student must get a pseudonym maximally similar to his own name. The pseudonym must be a name of some character of the popular saga and now the teachers are busy matching pseudonyms to student names.\n\nThere are n students in a summer school. Teachers chose exactly n pseudonyms for them. Each student must get exactly one pseudonym corresponding to him. Let us determine the relevance of a pseudonym b to a student with name a as the length of the largest common prefix a and b. We will represent such value as $\\operatorname{lcp}(a, b)$. Then we can determine the quality of matching of the pseudonyms to students as a sum of relevances of all pseudonyms to the corresponding students.\n\nFind the matching between students and pseudonyms with the maximum quality.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of students in the summer school.\n\nNext n lines contain the name of the students. Each name is a non-empty word consisting of lowercase English letters. Some names can be repeating.\n\nThe last n lines contain the given pseudonyms. Each pseudonym is a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. Some pseudonyms can be repeating.\n\nThe total length of all the names and pseudonyms doesn't exceed 800 000 characters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the maximum possible quality of matching pseudonyms to students.\n\nIn the next n lines describe the optimal matching. Each line must have the form a b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), that means that the student who was number a in the input, must match to the pseudonym number b in the input.\n\nThe matching should be a one-to-one correspondence, that is, each student and each pseudonym should occur exactly once in your output. If there are several optimal answers, output any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\ngennady\ngalya\nboris\nbill\ntoshik\nbilbo\ntorin\ngendalf\nsmaug\ngaladriel\n\nOutput\n11\n4 1\n2 5\n1 3\n5 2\n3 4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test from the statement the match looks as follows:   bill  \u2192  bilbo (lcp = 3)  galya  \u2192  galadriel (lcp = 3)  gennady  \u2192  gendalf (lcp = 3)  toshik  \u2192  torin (lcp = 2)  boris  \u2192  smaug (lcp = 0)\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
