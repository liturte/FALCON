Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.\n\nYour house has $n$ rooms. In the $i$-th room you can install at most $c_i$ heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with $k$ sections is equal to $k^2$ burles.\n\nSince rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least $sum_i$ sections in total in the $i$-th room. \n\nFor each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most $c_i$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $sum_i$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of rooms.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains the description of some room. The $i$-th line contains two integers $c_i$ and $sum_i$ ($1 \\le c_i, sum_i \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the $i$-th room, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each room print one integer \u2014 the minimum possible cost to install at most $c_i$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $sum_i$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1 10000\n10000 1\n2 6\n4 6\n\nOutput\n100000000\n1\n18\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first room, you can install only one radiator, so it's optimal to use the radiator with $sum_1$ sections. The cost of the radiator is equal to $(10^4)^2 = 10^8$.\n\nIn the second room, you can install up to $10^4$ radiators, but since you need only one section in total, it's optimal to buy one radiator with one section.\n\nIn the third room, there $7$ variants to install radiators: $[6, 0]$, $[5, 1]$, $[4, 2]$, $[3, 3]$, $[2, 4]$, $[1, 5]$, $[0, 6]$. The optimal variant is $[3, 3]$ and it costs $3^2+ 3^2 = 18$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
