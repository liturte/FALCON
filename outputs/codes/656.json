For each day we know the forecast for the average air temperature that day. \n\nVasya has a new set of winter tires which allows him to drive safely no more than k days at any average air temperature. After k days of using it (regardless of the temperature of these days) the set of winter tires wears down and cannot be used more. It is not necessary that these k days form a continuous segment of days.\n\nBefore the first winter day Vasya still uses summer tires. It is possible to drive safely on summer tires any number of days when the average air temperature is non-negative. It is impossible to drive on summer tires at days when the average air temperature is negative. \n\nVasya can change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa at the beginning of any day.\n\nFind the minimum number of times Vasya needs to change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during the winter. At the end of the winter the car can be with any set of tires.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of winter days and the number of days winter tires can be used. It is allowed to drive on winter tires at any temperature, but no more than k days in total.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} ( - 20 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 20)\u00a0\u2014 the average air temperature in the i-th winter day. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of times Vasya has to change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during all winter. If it is impossible, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n-5 20 -3 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 2\n-5 20 -3 0\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n10 6\n2 -5 1 3 0 0 -4 -3 1 0\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, use it for three days, and then change winter tires to summer tires because he can drive safely with the winter tires for just three days. Thus, the total number of tires' changes equals two. \n\nIn the second example before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, and then after the first winter day change winter tires to summer tires. After the second day it is necessary to change summer tires to winter tires again, and after the third day it is necessary to change winter tires to summer tires. Thus, the total number of tires' changes equals four.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
