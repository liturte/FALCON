Entrance n and entrance 1 are adjacent.\n\nToday Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance a and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house b entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance n should be followed by entrance 1). The negative value of b corresponds to moving |b| entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance 1 is followed by entrance n). If b = 0, then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance. [Image] Illustration for n = 6, a = 2, b =  - 5. \n\nHelp Vasya to determine the number of the entrance, near which he will be at the end of his walk.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n,  - 100 \u2264 b \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of entrances at Vasya's place, the number of his entrance and the length of his walk, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the entrance where Vasya will be at the end of his walk.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 2 -5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 1 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3 2 7\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is illustrated by the picture in the statements.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
