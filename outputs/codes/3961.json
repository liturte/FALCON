Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.\n\nThe maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number p_{i}, where 1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 i.\n\nIn order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.   Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1.  Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room p_{i}), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. \n\nHelp Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers p_{i} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 i). Each p_{i} denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\n1 1 2 3\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n62\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
