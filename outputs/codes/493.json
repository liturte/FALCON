Instead, he decided to play with the dominoes and make a \"domino show\".\n\nChris arranges n dominoes in a line, placing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However, somewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at least one domino pushed in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process. [Image] \n\nGiven the initial directions Chris has pushed the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string s_{i} is equal to   \"L\", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;  \"R\", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;  \".\", if the i-th domino has not been pushed. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if s_{i} = s_{j} = \"L\" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = \"R\"; if s_{i} = s_{j} = \"R\" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = \"L\".\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n14\n.L.R...LR..L..\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5\nR....\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n1\n.\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange.\n\nIn the second example case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other pieces.\n\nIn the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either direction.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
