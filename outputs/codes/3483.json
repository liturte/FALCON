MTA used to sell them individually, but now has decided to adopt a new business strategy that involves randomly choosing $4$ figurines from the entire collection to be packaged and sold together as a \u2018$4$-pack\u2019. Each figurine in a $4$-pack is chosen independently and randomly with uniform distribution. As such, it is possible that a $4$-pack may contain multiple copies of a particular figurine.\n\nEven though some figurines may be more valuable than others, every randomly assembled $4$-pack is sold at the same price. Customers buying a $4$-pack of figurines do not know ahead of time which figurines will be inside, and so it is a matter of chance whether they get the figurines that they want most. While the price is the same across all $4$-packs, the weight is not, as each figurine has a distinct integer weight in grams.\n\nBefore MTA releases its new line of figurines, its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would like an executive summary with information about the proposed $4$-packs. Specifically, the CFO wants to know: the greatest possible weight of a $4$-pack, the smallest possible weight of a $4$-pack, the number of distinct weights that a $4$-pack could have, and the expected weight of a $4$-pack. Note that the expected weight is the average (mean) weight across all possible distinct $4$-packs, where two $4$-packs are distinct if and only if one $4$-pack has a different number of figurines of any particular weight than the other $4$-pack. So, for example, a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,2,3,5\\} $ is distinct from a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,3,3,4\\} $ (even though they both have the same total weight). Also, a $4$-pack with weights $\\{ 2,2,3,5\\} $ is distinct from a 4-pack with weights $\\{ 2,3,3,5\\} $.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$, the number of different figurines to be produced, where $1\\leq N\\leq 40000$. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the weight in grams of each of the figurines. Each weight, $k$, is an integer satisfying $1\\leq k\\leq 60000$, and all $N$ weights are distinct.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should consist of a single line with $4$ space-separated values. The first value should be an integer, the maximum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The second value should be an integer, the minimum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The third value should be an integer, the number of distinct weights that the $4$-packs can have for the given set of figurines. The fourth value should be a floating-point value, the expected weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines, with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-4}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 2 4 7\nSample Output:\n28 4 21 14.0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
