Their new effort is a password system used to hide a password inside another string of characters we denote as a message. However, it is important that the message has a certain property relative to the hidden password.\n\nLet us assume that we denote the characters of the password as $ c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_ P$ (although those characters need not be distinct). To be a valid message for the password, if you start from the beginning of the message and search for any character from the set $\\{ c_1, \\ldots , c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_1$ is the first that you find. Subsequently, if you continue looking from that point of the message for any character from the set $\\{ c_2, \\ldots , c_ P \\} $, it must be that $c_2$ is the next that you find. Continuing in that manner, $c_3$ must be the next character from the set $\\{ c_3, \\ldots , c_ P\\} $, and so on until reaching $c_ P$.\n\nFor example, if the password is ABC, then the string HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY is a valid message.\n - Notice that A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the message. (The initial H is not relevant.)\n - Following the A that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is B.\n - Following the B that was found, the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $C$\\} $ is indeed C.\n\n (Note that the A in DAY is not relevant, since we are only looking for a C at this point, and the additional A and C in CACEY are not relevant, because we have already completed the password with the first C.)\n\nHowever, for the password ABC, the string TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY is not a valid message.\n - While the A is the first of the set $\\{ $A, B, C$\\} $ to appear in the string,\n\n the next occurrence from the set $\\{ $B, C$\\} $ is C rather than B.\n\nAlso, the string HAPPYBIRTHDAY is not a valid message for the password ABC because the C never appears.\n\nAs an example with duplicate letters in the password, consider the password SECRET. For this password, the string SOMECHORESARETOUGH is a valid message. In contrast, the string SOMECHEERSARETOUGH is not a valid message, because an extraneous E is found at the point when an R is first expected.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing two strings. The first string is the password, having length $P$, with $3 \\leq P \\leq 8$. The second string has length $S$, with $10 \\leq S \\leq 40$. Both strings will consist solely of uppercase letters. (That is, neither string can include whitespace, lowercase letters, digits, or other special characters.)\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with the word PASS if the second string is a valid message for the password, or FAIL otherwise.\n\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nABC HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY\nSample Output 1:\nPASS\n\nSample Input 2:\nABC TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY\nSample Output 2:\nFAIL\n\nSample Input 3:\nABC HAPPYBIRTHDAY\nSample Output 3:\nFAIL\n\nSample Input 4:\nSECRET SOMECHORESARETOUGH\nSample Output 4:\nPASS\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
