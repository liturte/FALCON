Help them obtain the required permutation by paying as little money as possible.\n\nMore formally, we have two permutations, p and s of numbers from 1 to n. We can swap p_{i} and p_{j}, by paying |i - j| coins for it. Find and print the smallest number of coins required to obtain permutation s from permutation p. Also print the sequence of swap operations at which we obtain a solution. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the length of the permutations.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n numbers from 1 to n \u2014 permutation p. Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this line.\n\nThe third line contains a sequence of n numbers from 1 to n \u2014 permutation s. Each number from 1 to n occurs once in this line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to transform permutation p into permutation s.\n\nIn the second line print number k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b710^6) \u2014 the number of operations needed to get the solution.\n\nIn the next k lines print the operations. Each line must contain two numbers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i \u2260 j), which means that you need to swap p_{i} and p_{j}.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the solution exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n4 2 1 3\n3 2 4 1\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n4 3\n3 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test we swap numbers on positions 3 and 4 and permutation p becomes 4 2 3 1. We pay |3 - 4| = 1 coins for that. On second turn we swap numbers on positions 1 and 3 and get permutation 3241 equal to s. We pay |3 - 1| = 2 coins for that. In total we pay three coins.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
