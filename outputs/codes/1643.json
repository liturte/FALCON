You can hack this problem if you solve it. But you can hack the previous problem only if you solve both problems.\n\nKirk has a binary string $s$ (a string which consists of zeroes and ones) of length $n$ and he is asking you to find a binary string $t$ of the same length which satisfies the following conditions: For any $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$) the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r}$ is equal to the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $t_{l}t_{l+1} \\ldots t_{r}$; The number of zeroes in $t$ is the maximum possible.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence of a string $p$ is a sequence of indices $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ such that $i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k$ and $p_{i_1} \\leq p_{i_2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq p_{i_k}$. The length of the subsequence is $k$.\n\nIf there are multiple substrings which satisfy the conditions, output any.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a binary string of length not more than $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a binary string which satisfied the above conditions. If there are many such strings, output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n110\n\nOutput\n010\n\nInput\n010\n\nOutput\n010\n\nInput\n0001111\n\nOutput\n0000000\n\nInput\n0111001100111011101000\n\nOutput\n0011001100001011101000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example:  For the substrings of the length $1$ the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequnce is $1$;  For $l = 1, r = 2$ the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $s_{1}s_{2}$ is $11$ and the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $t_{1}t_{2}$ is $01$;  For $l = 1, r = 3$ the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $s_{1}s_{3}$ is $11$ and the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $t_{1}t_{3}$ is $00$;  For $l = 2, r = 3$ the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $s_{2}s_{3}$ is $1$ and the longest non-decreasing subsequnce of the substring $t_{2}t_{3}$ is $1$; \n\nThe second example is similar to the first one.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
