The table consists of n rows and m columns. By a_{i}, j we will denote the integer located at the i-th row and the j-th column. We say that the table is sorted in non-decreasing order in the column j if a_{i}, j \u2264 a_{i} + 1, j for all i from 1 to n - 1.\n\nTeacher gave Alyona k tasks. For each of the tasks two integers l and r are given and Alyona has to answer the following question: if one keeps the rows from l to r inclusive and deletes all others, will the table be sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column? Formally, does there exist such j that a_{i}, j \u2264 a_{i} + 1, j for all i from l to r - 1 inclusive.\n\nAlyona is too small to deal with this task and asks you to help!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers n and m (1 \u2264 n\u00b7m \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the table respectively. Note that your are given a constraint that bound the product of these two integers, i.e. the number of elements in the table.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains m integers. The j-th integers in the i of these lines stands for a_{i}, j (1 \u2264 a_{i}, j \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe next line of the input contains an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of task that teacher gave to Alyona.\n\nThe i-th of the next k lines contains two integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" to the i-th line of the output if the table consisting of rows from l_{i} to r_{i} inclusive is sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column. Otherwise, print \"No\".\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 4\n1 2 3 5\n3 1 3 2\n4 5 2 3\n5 5 3 2\n4 4 3 4\n6\n1 1\n2 5\n4 5\n3 5\n1 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the sample, the whole table is not sorted in any column. However, rows 1\u20133 are sorted in column 1, while rows 4\u20135 are sorted in column 3.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
