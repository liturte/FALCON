As known, little bears loves spending their free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning, walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started playing the game.\n\nRules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds n is defined. In every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers from 1 to 6 written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.\n\nIn average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.\n\nMishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains single integer n n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of game rounds.\n\nThe next n lines contains rounds description. i-th of them contains pair of integers m_{i} and c_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i},  c_{i} \u2264 6)\u00a0\u2014 values on dice upper face after Mishka's and Chris' throws in i-th round respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Mishka is the winner of the game, print \"Mishka\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf Chris is the winner of the game, print \"Chris\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf the result of the game is draw, print \"Friendship is magic!^^\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n3 5\n2 1\n4 2\n\nOutput\nMishka\nInput\n2\n6 1\n1 6\n\nOutput\nFriendship is magic!^^\nInput\n3\n1 5\n3 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\nChris\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case Mishka loses the first round, but wins second and third rounds and thus she is the winner of the game.\n\nIn the second sample case Mishka wins the first round, Chris wins the second round, and the game ends with draw with score 1:1.\n\nIn the third sample case Chris wins the first round, but there is no winner of the next two rounds. The winner of the game is Chris.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
