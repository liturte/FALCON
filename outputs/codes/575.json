Alice has a single piece left\u00a0\u2014 a queen, located at $(a_x, a_y)$, while Bob has only the king standing at $(b_x, b_y)$. Alice thinks that as her queen is dominating the chessboard, victory is hers. \n\nBut Bob has made a devious plan to seize the victory for himself\u00a0\u2014 he needs to march his king to $(c_x, c_y)$ in order to claim the victory for himself. As Alice is distracted by her sense of superiority, she no longer moves any pieces around, and it is only Bob who makes any turns.\n\nBob will win if he can move his king from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check. Remember that a king can move to any of the $8$ adjacent squares. A king is in check if it is on the same rank (i.e. row), file (i.e. column), or diagonal as the enemy queen. \n\nFind whether Bob can win or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $a_x$ and $a_y$ ($1 \\leq a_x, a_y \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of Alice's queen.\n\nThe third line contains two integers $b_x$ and $b_y$ ($1 \\leq b_x, b_y \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of Bob's king.\n\nThe fourth line contains two integers $c_x$ and $c_y$ ($1 \\leq c_x, c_y \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the location that Bob wants to get to.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Bob's king is currently not in check and the target location is not in check either.\n\nFurthermore, the king is not located on the same square as the queen (i.e. $a_x \\neq b_x$ or $a_y \\neq b_y$), and the target does coincide neither with the queen's position (i.e. $c_x \\neq a_x$ or $c_y \\neq a_y$) nor with the king's position (i.e. $c_x \\neq b_x$ or $c_y \\neq b_y$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if Bob can get from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8\n4 4\n1 3\n3 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n8\n4 4\n2 3\n1 6\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n8\n3 5\n1 2\n6 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the diagrams below, the squares controlled by the black queen are marked red, and the target square is marked blue.\n\nIn the first case, the king can move, for instance, via the squares $(2, 3)$ and $(3, 2)$. Note that the direct route through $(2, 2)$ goes through check.\n\n [Image] \n\nIn the second case, the queen watches the fourth rank, and the king has no means of crossing it.\n\n [Image] \n\nIn the third case, the queen watches the third file.\n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
