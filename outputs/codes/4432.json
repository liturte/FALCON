For example, if $a=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, then possible subsequences are: $[1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[3]$ and $[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, but not $[3, 2, 3]$ and $[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$.\n\nYou are given a sequence $a$ consisting of $n$ positive and negative elements (there is no zeros in the sequence).\n\nYour task is to choose maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of the given sequence (i.e. the sign of each next element is the opposite from the sign of the current element, like positive-negative-positive and so on or negative-positive-negative and so on). Among all such subsequences, you have to choose one which has the maximum sum of elements.\n\nIn other words, if the maximum length of alternating subsequence is $k$ then your task is to find the maximum sum of elements of some alternating subsequence of length $k$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements in $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9, a_i \\ne 0$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the maximum sum of the maximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of $a$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n1 2 3 -1 -2\n4\n-1 -2 -1 -3\n10\n-2 8 3 8 -4 -15 5 -2 -3 1\n6\n1 -1000000000 1 -1000000000 1 -1000000000\n\nOutput\n2\n-1\n6\n-2999999997\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[1, 2, \\underline{3}, \\underline{-1}, -2]$.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[-1, -2, \\underline{-1}, -3]$.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[\\underline{-2}, 8, 3, \\underline{8}, \\underline{-4}, -15, \\underline{5}, \\underline{-2}, -3, \\underline{1}]$.\n\nIn the fourth test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $[\\underline{1}, \\underline{-1000000000}, \\underline{1}, \\underline{-1000000000}, \\underline{1}, \\underline{-1000000000}]$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
