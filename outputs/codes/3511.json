Pokenom trainers can now travel the world, capture Pokenom in the wild and battle each other! Bash \u2014 the Pokenom trainer \u2014 has decided to drop out of his university to pursue his childhood dream of becoming the best Pokenom trainer!\n\nHowever, Linux \u2014 Bash\u2019s university headmaster \u2014 does not allow his students to drop out so easily \u2026\n\nLinux puts $N$ black boxes on a straight line. The black boxes are numbered from $1$ to $N$ from left to right. Initially, all black boxes are empty. Then Linux gives Bash $Q$ queries. Each query can be one of the following $2$ types:\n - Linux puts exactly one stone inside exactly one box between $u$-th box and $v$-th box, inclusive, with equal probability. $(1 \\le u \\le v \\le N)$.\n - Let $a_ i$ be the number of stones in black box numbered $i$. Let $A = \\sum _{i=1}^{N}{a_ i^2}$. Bash has to calculate the expected value $E(A)$.\n\nBash can only drop out of his university if he is able to answer all queries correctly. But now all Bash can think of is Pokenom. Please help him!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains exactly $2$ positive integers $N$ and $Q$. $(1 \\le N, Q \\le 10^5)$.\n\n$Q$ lines follow, each line contains exactly one query. As explained, a query can be one of the following $2$ types:\n - $1 \\; u \\; v$: Linux puts a stone inside one of the boxes between $u$ and $v$.\n - $2$: Linux asks Bash to compute $E(A)$.\n\n-----Output-----\nIt can be proved that the expected value can be represented as an irreducible fraction $\\dfrac {A}{B}$. For each query of type $2$, print one line containing the value $A \\times B^{-1}$ modulo $10^{9} + 7$. The given input guarantees that $B$ is not a multiple of $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n-----Explanation for examples-----\n - In the first example: With a probability of $0.5$, two stones are in different squares. Hence, the answer to the fourth query is $0.5 \\times (1^{2} + 1^{2}) + 0.5 \\times 2^{2} = 3$.\n - In the second example: With a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, two stones are in different squares. Hence, the answer to the fourth query is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n2 4\n1 1 2\n2\n1 1 2\n2\nSample Output:\n1\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
