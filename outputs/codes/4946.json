Better yet, she has defined the awkwardness level of a seating arrangement to be the minimum number of seats separating any two guests speaking the same language. If no two people speak the same language, the awkwardness level is defined to be $n$ (the number of guests). Two seats next to each other are said to be separated by $1$.\n\nGiven the languages spoken in a proposed seating arrangement, can you help Margarethe determine the awkwardness level?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100000$) denoting the number of guests. On the second line follows $n$ integers, the $i$\u2019th of which $x_ i$ ($0 \\leq x_ i \\leq 10^9$) indicating the language spoken by the guest seated at position $i$ in the proposed arrangement (each guest speaks exactly one language).\n\n-----Output-----\nA single integer, the awkwardness level of the proposed seating arrangement.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1 2 3 1\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
