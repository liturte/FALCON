During his life, he has visited cafes n times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.\n\nFirst of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn first line there is one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5)\u00a0\u2014 number of cafes indices written by Vlad.\n\nIn second line, n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2\u00b710^5) are written\u00a0\u2014 indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 3 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6\n2 1 2 2 4 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices 1 and 2 were after the last visit to cafe with index 3; so this cafe is the answer. \n\nIn second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices 1, 2 and 4. Cafes with indices 1 and 4 were visited after the last visit of cafe with index 2, so the answer is 2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
