Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.\n\nInitially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers x and y (0 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of copies and the number of original toys Imp wants to get (including the initial one).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\", if the desired configuration is possible, and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 3\n\nOutput\nYes\n\nInput\n4 2\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n1000 1001\n\nOutput\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Imp has to apply the machine twice to original toys and then twice to copies.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
