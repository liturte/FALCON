And if he had an integer $n=6$, $n$ will be changed to $8$.\n\nOrac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.\n\nNow, for two positive integers $n$ and $k$, Orac asked you to add $f(n)$ to $n$ exactly $k$ times (note that $n$ will change after each operation, so $f(n)$ may change too) and tell him the final value of $n$.\n\nFor example, if Orac gives you $n=5$ and $k=2$, at first you should add $f(5)=5$ to $n=5$, so your new value of $n$ will be equal to $n=10$, after that, you should add $f(10)=2$ to $10$, so your new (and the final!) value of $n$ will be equal to $12$.\n\nOrac may ask you these queries many times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input is a single integer $t\\ (1\\le t\\le 100)$: the number of times that Orac will ask you.\n\nEach of the next $t$ lines contains two positive integers $n,k\\ (2\\le n\\le 10^6, 1\\le k\\le 10^9)$, corresponding to a query by Orac.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ is at most $10^6$. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them should contain the final value of $n$ in the $i$-th query by Orac.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5 1\n8 2\n3 4\n\nOutput\n10\n12\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query, $n=5$ and $k=1$. The divisors of $5$ are $1$ and $5$, the smallest one except $1$ is $5$. Therefore, the only operation adds $f(5)=5$ to $5$, and the result is $10$.\n\nIn the second query, $n=8$ and $k=2$. The divisors of $8$ are $1,2,4,8$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, then after one operation $8$ turns into $8+(f(8)=2)=10$. The divisors of $10$ are $1,2,5,10$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, therefore the answer is $10+(f(10)=2)=12$.\n\nIn the third query, $n$ is changed as follows: $3 \\to 6 \\to 8 \\to 10 \\to 12$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
