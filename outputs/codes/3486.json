She arranges her students in a circle and assigns each student an integer in the range $[2,10^9]$. She also provides the students with crepe paper streamers. The students are to stretch these streamers between pairs of students, and pull them tight. But, there are some rules.\n - Two students can stretch a streamer between them if and only if their assigned integers share a factor other than $1$.\n - There is exactly one path, going from streamer to streamer, between any two students in the circle.\n - No streamers may cross.\n - Any given student may hold an end of arbitrarily many streamers.\n\nSuppose Ms. Hall has four students, and she gives them the numbers $2$, $3$, $30$ and $45$. In this arrangement, there is one way to stretch the streamers:\n\nIn this arrangement, there are three ways to stretch the streamers:  \n\nIn how many ways can the students hold the streamers subject to Ms. Hall\u2019s rules? Two ways are different if and only if there is a streamer between two given students one way, but none between those two students the other way.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will contain a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 300$), which is the number of Ms. Hall\u2019s students.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines will hold an integer $x$ ($2 \\le x \\le 10^9$). These are the numbers held by the students, in order. Remember, the students are standing in a circle, so the last student is adjacent to the first student.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer, which is the number of ways Ms. Hall\u2019s students can satisfy her rules. Since this number may be very large, output it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n30\n3\n2\n45\nSample Output:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
