For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nFor a positive integer $n$, we call a permutation $p$ of length $n$ good if the following condition holds for every pair $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014   $(p_i \\text{ OR } p_{i+1} \\text{ OR } \\ldots \\text{ OR } p_{j-1} \\text{ OR } p_{j}) \\ge j-i+1$, where $\\text{OR}$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. \n\nIn other words, a permutation $p$ is good if for every subarray of $p$, the $\\text{OR}$ of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. \n\nGiven a positive integer $n$, output any good permutation of length $n$. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of every test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor every test, output any good permutation of length $n$ on a separate line. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n1\n3\n7\n\nOutput\n1\n3 1 2\n4 3 5 2 7 1 6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor $n = 3$, $[3,1,2]$ is a good permutation. Some of the subarrays are listed below.   $3\\text{ OR }1 = 3 \\geq 2$ $(i = 1,j = 2)$  $3\\text{ OR }1\\text{ OR }2 = 3 \\geq 3$ $(i = 1,j = 3)$  $1\\text{ OR }2 = 3 \\geq 2$ $(i = 2,j = 3)$  $1 \\geq 1$ $(i = 2,j = 2)$ \n\nSimilarly, you can verify that $[4,3,5,2,7,1,6]$ is also good.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
