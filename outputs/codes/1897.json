In order to evaluate which songs he likes more, he introduced the notion of the song's prettiness. The title of the song is a word consisting of uppercase Latin letters. The prettiness of the song is the prettiness of its title.\n\nLet's define the simple prettiness of a word as the ratio of the number of vowels in the word to the number of all letters in the word.\n\nLet's define the prettiness of a word as the sum of simple prettiness of all the substrings of the word.\n\nMore formally, let's define the function vowel(c) which is equal to 1, if c is a vowel, and to 0 otherwise. Let s_{i} be the i-th character of string s, and s_{i}..j be the substring of word s, staring at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character (s_{is}_{i} + 1... s_{j}, i \u2264 j).\n\nThen the simple prettiness of s is defined by the formula:$\\operatorname{simple}(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{|s|} \\operatorname{vowel}(s_{i})}{|s|}$\n\nThe prettiness of s equals $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq|s|} \\operatorname{simple}(s_{i . . j})$\n\nFind the prettiness of the given song title.\n\nWe assume that the vowels are I, E, A, O, U, Y.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the title of the song.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the prettiness of the song with the absolute or relative error of at most 10^{ - 6}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nIEAIAIO\n\nOutput\n28.0000000\n\nInput\nBYOB\n\nOutput\n5.8333333\n\nInput\nYISVOWEL\n\nOutput\n17.0500000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample all letters are vowels. The simple prettiness of each substring is 1. The word of length 7 has 28 substrings. So, the prettiness of the song equals to 28.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
