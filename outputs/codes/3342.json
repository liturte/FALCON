Unfortunately, the onions he loves belong to the local vegetable farmer, L\u00f6kas Tomatcek. Since Oskar is very cheap, he simply steals L\u00f6kas\u2019 onions from the large, convex, onion field. For obvious reasons, L\u00f6kas does not approve of this. Rather than going to the police, however, L\u00f6kas wants to raise a high-energy laser fence around the onions to replace his wooden fence. \n\nAs laser fences are rather expensive, L\u00f6kas can only afford to upgrade $K$ of the fence posts to laser fence posts. If a set of posts are upgraded, the lasers will protect all the onions lying strictly within the convex hull of the selected fence posts. This may not be all of the onions though. L\u00f6kas wonders which posts he should upgrade if he wants to protect as many of his $N$ onions as possible.\n\nThe original fence has the shape of a convex polygon with $M$ fence posts as vertices, and all the onions lie strictly within the fence.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input consists of three space-separated integers $3 \\le N \\le 10000$, $3 \\le M \\le 400$ and $3 \\le K \\le 400$. These are the number of onions, the number of old fence posts, and the number of fence posts L\u00f6kas can upgrade.\n\nThen follow $N$ lines with two space-separated integers $0 \\le X_ i, Y_ i \\le 10^9$ each. $(X_ i, Y_ i)$ gives the coordinate of the $i$-th onion.\n\nThen follow $M$ lines with two space-separated integers $0 \\le A_ i, B_ i \\le 10^9$ each. $(A_ i, B_ i)$ gives the coordinate of the $i$-th fence post.\n\nThe fence posts will be given in clockwise order of the old fence. No three fence posts will lie on a line.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput should be a single integer; the maximum number of onions L\u00f6kas can protect.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 5 3\n1 1\n2 2\n1 3\n0 0\n0 3\n1 4\n3 3\n3 0\nSample Output:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
