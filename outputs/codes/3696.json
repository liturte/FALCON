Then polynomial $A(x)$ can be uniquely represented in the following way:$A(x) = B(x) \\cdot D(x) + R(x), \\operatorname{deg} R(x) < \\operatorname{deg} B(x)$\n\nThis can be done using long division. Here, $\\operatorname{deg} P(x)$ denotes the degree of polynomial P(x). $R(x)$ is called the remainder of division of polynomial $A(x)$ by polynomial $B(x)$, it is also denoted as $A \\operatorname{mod} B$. \n\nSince there is a way to divide polynomials with remainder, we can define Euclid's algorithm of finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. The algorithm takes two polynomials $(A, B)$. If the polynomial $B(x)$ is zero, the result is $A(x)$, otherwise the result is the value the algorithm returns for pair $(B, A \\operatorname{mod} B)$. On each step the degree of the second argument decreases, so the algorithm works in finite number of steps. But how large that number could be? You are to answer this question. \n\nYou are given an integer n. You have to build two polynomials with degrees not greater than n, such that their coefficients are integers not exceeding 1 by their absolute value, the leading coefficients (ones with the greatest power of x) are equal to one, and the described Euclid's algorithm performs exactly n steps finding their greatest common divisor. Moreover, the degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second. By a step of the algorithm we mean the transition from pair $(A, B)$ to pair $(B, A \\operatorname{mod} B)$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nYou are given a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 150)\u00a0\u2014 the number of steps of the algorithm you need to reach.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two polynomials in the following format.\n\nIn the first line print a single integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the degree of the polynomial. \n\nIn the second line print m + 1 integers between  - 1 and 1\u00a0\u2014 the coefficients of the polynomial, from constant to leading. \n\nThe degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second polynomial, the leading coefficients should be equal to 1.
