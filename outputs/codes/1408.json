He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is t_{i} and its pages' width is equal to w_{i}. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights. $1$ \n\nShaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure. [Image] \n\nHelp Shaass to find the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the next n lines contains two integers t_{i} and w_{i} denoting the thickness and width of the i-th book correspondingly, (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 100).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the only line of the output print the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 12\n1 3\n2 15\n2 5\n2 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n3\n1 10\n2 1\n2 4\n\nOutput\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
