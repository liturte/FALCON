Unfortunately, during the casting, some small flecks of dirt got into the mix, and now appear as a cluster of pinpoint flaws in the otherwise clear cube.\n\nHe wants to drill out the portion of the cube containing the flaws so that he can plug the removed volume with new, clear acrylic. He would prefer to do this in one drilling step. For stability\u2019s sake, the drill must enter the cube only once, perpendicular to one of its faces. The cube\u2019s faces are parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nGiven the $(x,y,z)$ positions of the flaws, and treating the size of the flaws as negligible, what is the smallest diameter drill bit that can be used to remove the flaws in one operation??\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of flaws. $3 \\leq N \\leq 5000$\n\nThis is followed by $N$ lines of input, each containing three real numbers in the range $-1000.0\\ldots 1000.0$, denoting the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates of a single flaw. Each number contains at most $6$ digits following a decimal point. The decimal point may be omitted if all succeeding digits are zero.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the diameter of the smallest drill bit that would remove all the flaws.\n\nThe answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is less than $10^{-4}$\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1.0 0.0 1.4\n-1.0 0.0 -1.4\n0.0 1.0 -0.2\nSample Output 1:\n2.0000000000\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n1.4 1.0 0.0\n-0.4 -1.0 0.0\n-0.1 -0.25 -0.5\n-1.2 0.0 0.9\n0.2 0.5 0.5\nSample Output 2:\n2.0000000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
