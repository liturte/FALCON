MPS assumes all positions are discrete points on a regular two-dimensional grid. Within MPS, a position is represented by a pair of integers $(X,Y)$.\n\nTo determine its position, an MPS receiver first measures its distance to a number of beacons. Beacons have known, fixed locations. MPS signals propagate only along the $X$ and $Y$ axes through the streets of the city, not diagonally through building blocks. When an MPS receiver at $(X_ R,Y_ R)$ measures its distance to a beacon at $(X_ B,Y_ B)$, it thus obtains the Manhattan distance: $|X_ R - X_ B|+|Y_ R - Y_ B|$.\n\nGiven the positions of a number of beacons and the Manhattan-distances between the receiver and each beacon, determine the position of the receiver. Note that the receiver must be at an integer grid position (MPS does not yet support fractional coordinates).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$, the number of beacons ($1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$). Then follow $N$ lines, each containing three integers, $X_ i$, $Y_ i$, and $D_ i$, such that $-10^6 \\leq X_ i, Y_ i \\leq 10^6$ and $0 \\leq D_ i \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^6$. The pair $(X_ i, Y_ i)$ denotes the position of beacon $i$, while $D_ i$ is the Manhattan distance between receiver and beacon $i$.\n\nNo two beacons have the same position.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf there is exactly one receiver position consistent with the input, write one line with two integers, $X_ R$ and $Y_ R$, the position of the receiver.\n\nIf multiple receiver positions are consistent with the input, write one line with the word \u201cuncertain\u201d.\n\nIf no receiver position is consistent with the input, write one line with the word \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n999999 0 1000\n999900 950 451\n987654 123 13222\nSample Output 1:\n1000200 799\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n100 0 101\n0 200 199\nSample Output 2:\nuncertain\n\nSample Input 3:\n2\n100 0 100\n0 200 199\nSample Output 3:\nimpossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
