He wants to convert $s$ into $t$ using the following operation as few times as possible.\n\nIn one operation, he can choose any subsequence of $s$ and rotate it clockwise once.\n\nFor example, if $s = 1\\textbf{1}101\\textbf{00}$, he can choose a subsequence corresponding to indices ($1$-based) $\\{2, 6, 7 \\}$ and rotate them clockwise. The resulting string would then be $s = 1\\textbf{0}101\\textbf{10}$.\n\nA string $a$ is said to be a subsequence of string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.\n\nTo perform a clockwise rotation on a sequence $c$ of size $k$ is to perform an operation which sets $c_1:=c_k, c_2:=c_1, c_3:=c_2, \\ldots, c_k:=c_{k-1}$ simultaneously.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of operations Naman has to perform to convert $s$ into $t$ or say that it is impossible. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 10^6)$\u00a0\u2014 the length of the strings.\n\nThe second line contains the binary string $s$ of length $n$.\n\nThe third line contains the binary string $t$ of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to convert $s$ to $t$ after any number of operations, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print the minimum number of operations required.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n010000\n000001\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n10\n1111100000\n0000011111\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n8\n10101010\n01010101\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n10\n1111100000\n1111100001\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, Naman can choose the subsequence corresponding to indices $\\{2, 6\\}$ and rotate it once to convert $s$ into $t$.\n\nIn the second test, he can rotate the subsequence corresponding to all indices $5$ times. It can be proved, that it is the minimum required number of operations.\n\nIn the last test, it is impossible to convert $s$ into $t$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
