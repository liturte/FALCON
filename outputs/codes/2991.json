Each gnome can be uniquely identified by a number $1..n$ written on their hat.\n\nSuppose there are $5$ gnomes. The gnomes could line up like so: $1, 3, 4, 2, 5$.\n\nNow, an evil magician will remove some of the gnomes from the lineup and wipe your memory of the order of the gnomes. The result is a subsequence, perhaps like so: $1, 4, 2$.\n\nHe then tells you that if you ordered all permutations of $1..n$ in lexicographical order, the original sequence of gnomes is the first such permutation which contains the remaining subsequence. Your task is to find the original sequence of gnomes.\n\n-----Input-----\nEach input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will begin with a line with two integers $n$ and then $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le n \\le 10^5$), where $n$ is the number of gnomes originally, and $m$ is the number of gnomes remaining after the evil magician pulls his trick. Each of the next $m$ lines will contain a single integer $g$ ($1 \\le g \\le n$). These are the remaining gnomes, in order. The values of $g$ are guaranteed to be unique.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $n$ lines, each containing a single integer, representing the first permutation of gnomes that could contain the remaining gnomes in order.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 3\n1\n4\n2\nSample Output:\n1\n3\n4\n2\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
