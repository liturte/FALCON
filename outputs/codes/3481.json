This all changed with the release of his latest EP Wiggly Waves, which is the first album in history to go both Platinum and Uranium. With his newfound popularity, Doug (a.k.a. DJ Polygon) needs help with a problem most artists would be lucky to face: deciding which of his many gig offers to take.\n\nThere are $K$ venues in Graphland, connected by $R$ roads. The venues are numbered $1$ to $K$. Doug\u2019s house is venue $1$, and he is ready to leave or perform at time $t = 0$.\n\nDoug has $G$ gig offers. The $i$-th gig is at venue $V_ i$, runs during the time interval $[S_ i,E_ i)$ (inclusive start, exclusive end), and pays out $M_ i$ cryptocents. Doug can\u2019t take multiple gigs at the same time, and he can\u2019t take gigs while he\u2019s traveling between venues.\n\nDoug is overwhelmed by his newfound fame and many gig requests, and wants your help making as much money as possible.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $G$, $K$, and $R$: the number of gigs Doug has been offered, the number of venues in Graphland, and the number of roads connecting these venues.\n\nThese integers satisfy $1 \\leq G \\leq 200000$, $1 \\leq K \\leq 100$, and $0 \\leq R \\leq \\min \\left(4000, K(K-1)/2\\right)$.\n\nThen follow $R$ lines, each of which has three integers $A_ i$, $B_ i$, and $T_ i$, specifying the $i$-th (bidirectional) road. The $i$-th road connects venues $A_ i$ and $B_ i$ and it takes time $T_ i$ to travel the road in either direction. The values satisfy $1 \\leq A_ i, B_ i \\leq K$, $A_ i \\neq B_ i$, and $1 \\leq T_ i \\leq 1000000$. Every road has two distinct endpoints, and there is at most one road between any pair of venues.\n\nThen follow $G$ lines, each of which has four integers $V_ i$, $S_ i$, $E_ i$, and $M_ i$. This means the $i$-th gig runs from time $S_ i$ (inclusive) to $E_ i$ (exclusive) at venue $V_ i$, and pays $M_ i$ cryptocents. These values satisfy the bounds $0 \\leq S_ i < E_ i \\leq 1000000000$ and $1 \\leq M_ i \\leq 1000000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer: the maximum number of cryptocents that DJ Polygon can make by taking on the right gigs.\n\n-----Sample Explanation-----\nIn the first sample, There are two gigs at venue $1$ and one gig at venue $2$. Doug can either play both gigs at venue $1$ for $11$ cryptocents, or spend the first $10$ units of time traveling to venue $2$ and play that gig for $33$ cryptocents. He chooses the latter.\n\nIn the second sample, Doug makes the most by staying at venue $1$ and playing both of those gigs to earn $70$ cryptocents.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 2 1\n1 2 10\n1 4 6 6\n1 6 10 5\n2 10 30 33\nSample Output:\n33\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
