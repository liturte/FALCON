In the task he was given a set of n lines defined by the equations y = k_{i}\u00b7x + b_{i}. It was necessary to determine whether there is at least one point of intersection of two of these lines, that lays strictly inside the strip between x_1 < x_2. In other words, is it true that there are 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n and x', y', such that:   y' = k_{i} * x' + b_{i}, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number i;  y' = k_{j} * x' + b_{j}, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number j;  x_1 < x' < x_2, that is, point (x', y') lies inside the strip bounded by x_1 < x_2. \n\nYou can't leave Anton in trouble, can you? Write a program that solves the given task.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of lines in the task given to Anton. The second line contains integers x_1 and x_2 ( - 1 000 000 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 \u2264 1 000 000) defining the strip inside which you need to find a point of intersection of at least two lines.\n\nThe following n lines contain integers k_{i}, b_{i} ( - 1 000 000 \u2264 k_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the descriptions of the lines. It is guaranteed that all lines are pairwise distinct, that is, for any two i \u2260 j it is true that either k_{i} \u2260 k_{j}, or b_{i} \u2260 b_{j}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes), if there is at least one intersection of two distinct lines, located strictly inside the strip. Otherwise print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n1 2\n1 0\n0 1\n0 2\n\nOutput\nNO\nInput\n2\n1 3\n1 0\n-1 3\n\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n2\n1 3\n1 0\n0 2\n\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n2\n1 3\n1 0\n0 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample there are intersections located on the border of the strip, but there are no intersections located strictly inside it.
