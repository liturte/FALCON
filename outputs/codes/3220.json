Four dancing pairs stand as to form a square. A caller then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor.\n\nAmerican wizards, however, find square dancing a bit simplistic. Instead, they have come up with a kind of dance called circle dancing. In the dance, $N$ wizards stand in a circle numbered $1$ through $N$ clockwise. A caller then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor. Each such move has the following form. Every wizard is given a number $p_ i$. They then all teleport simultaneously $p_ i$ positions clockwise or counterclockwise in the ring. For example, given the number 1 they should move to one of the two places immediately adjacent to their current position.\n\nAfter a move is performed, no two wizards may occupy the same position. This means a certain amount of coordination is required when teleporting. Can you tell the wizards how they should teleport in order to not collide with each other?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 300000$), the number of wizards. The next line contains the $N$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots , p_ N$ ($0 \\le p_ i < N$). The wizards are numbered $1, 2, \\dots , N$ clockwise in the circle.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a string with $N$ characters. The $i$\u2019th character should be L if the $i$\u2019th wizard should teleport clockwise, and R if he should teleport counterclockwise. If there are multiple valid solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no valid solution, output no dance.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 1 1\nSample Output 1:\nLLL\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n1 2 2 1 2\nSample Output 2:\nLLRLR\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
