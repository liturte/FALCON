We will consider the rows of the field numbered with integers from 1 to 10^9 from top to bottom. The columns are similarly numbered with integers from 1 to 10^9 from left to right. We will denote a cell of the field that is located in the i-th row and j-th column as (i, j).\n\nYou know that some squares of the given chess field are allowed. All allowed cells of the chess field are given as n segments. Each segment is described by three integers r_{i}, a_{i}, b_{i} (a_{i} \u2264 b_{i}), denoting that cells in columns from number a_{i} to number b_{i} inclusive in the r_{i}-th row are allowed.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from square (x_0, y_0) to square (x_1, y_1), provided that he only moves along the allowed cells. In other words, the king can be located only on allowed cells on his way.\n\nLet us remind you that a chess king can move to any of the neighboring cells in one move. Two cells of a chess field are considered neighboring if they share at least one point.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1 (1 \u2264 x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1 \u2264 10^9), denoting the initial and the final positions of the king.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), denoting the number of segments of allowed cells. Next n lines contain the descriptions of these segments. The i-th line contains three space-separated integers r_{i}, a_{i}, b_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i}, a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 10^9, a_{i} \u2264 b_{i}), denoting that cells in columns from number a_{i} to number b_{i} inclusive in the r_{i}-th row are allowed. Note that the segments of the allowed cells can intersect and embed arbitrarily.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the king's initial and final position are allowed cells. It is guaranteed that the king's initial and the final positions do not coincide. It is guaranteed that the total length of all given segments doesn't exceed 10^5.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no path between the initial and final position along allowed cells, print -1.\n\nOtherwise print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from the initial position to the final one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 7 6 11\n3\n5 3 8\n6 7 11\n5 2 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3 4 3 10\n3\n3 1 4\n4 5 9\n3 10 10\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n1 1 2 10\n2\n1 1 3\n2 6 10\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
