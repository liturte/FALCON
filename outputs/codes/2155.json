These matrices have exactly one zero, while all other cells have the Manhattan distance to the cell containing the zero. The cells with equal numbers have the form of a rhombus, that is why Sonya called this type so.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two cells ($x_1$, $y_1$) and ($x_2$, $y_2$) is defined as $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$. For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells $(5, 2)$ and $(7, 1)$ equals to $|5-7|+|2-1|=3$. [Image] Example of a rhombic matrix. \n\nNote that rhombic matrices are uniquely defined by $n$, $m$, and the coordinates of the cell containing the zero.\n\nShe drew a $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix. She believes that you can not recreate the matrix if she gives you only the elements of this matrix in some arbitrary order (i.e., the sequence of $n\\cdot m$ numbers). Note that Sonya will not give you $n$ and $m$, so only the sequence of numbers in this matrix will be at your disposal.\n\nWrite a program that finds such an $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix whose elements are the same as the elements in the sequence in some order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\leq t\\leq 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $t$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_t$ ($0\\leq a_i< t$)\u00a0\u2014 the values in the cells in arbitrary order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($n \\times m = t$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the matrix.\n\nIn the second line, print two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1\\leq x\\leq n$, $1\\leq y\\leq m$)\u00a0\u2014 the row number and the column number where the cell with $0$ is located.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, print any of them. If there is no solution, print the single integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n20\n1 0 2 3 5 3 2 1 3 2 3 1 4 2 1 4 2 3 2 4\n\nOutput\n4 5\n2 2\n\nInput\n18\n2 2 3 2 4 3 3 3 0 2 4 2 1 3 2 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n3 6\n2 3\n\nInput\n6\n2 1 0 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nYou can see the solution to the first example in the legend. You also can choose the cell $(2, 2)$ for the cell where $0$ is located. You also can choose a $5\\times 4$ matrix with zero at $(4, 2)$.\n\nIn the second example, there is a $3\\times 6$ matrix, where the zero is located at $(2, 3)$ there.\n\nIn the third example, a solution does not exist.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
