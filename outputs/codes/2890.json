There are $M$ pairs of railway tracks that exist between the junctions. Trains can travel in both directions on each track. Each railway track is labelled either red, blue, or white in colour.\n\nTima, a tourist in the city, wants to travel from junction $S$ to junction $T$ in the minimum possible time. She has a map of the railway network that she can use to achieve this goal.\n\nTima, being rather eccentric, has an interesting constraint for her travel: She wants to travel via exactly $k_1$ red tracks, exactly $k_2$ blue tracks, and any number of white tracks, in any order. She is fine with using a railway track more than once.\n\nCan you tell the minimum time Tima will take to go from $S$ to $T$, ensuring that her constraint is not violated?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers: $N$, ($1 \\leq N \\leq 450$); $M$, ($1 \\leq M \\leq 1100$); $k_1$; and $k_2$, ($0 \\leq k_1, k_2 \\leq 800$, $k_1 \\cdot k_2 \\leq 800$). Following are $M$ lines. Each line contains four space-separated integers: $U~ V~ X~ C$, denoting that a track exists between junction $U$ and junction $V$, ($1 \\leq U, V \\leq N$, $U \\neq V$); the train covers this track in $X$ seconds, ($0 \\leq X \\leq 10^9$); and the track is labelled colour $C$, ($0 \\leq C \\leq 2$). A white track is denoted by $C=0$, a red track is denoted by $C=1$, and a blue track is denoted by $C=2$.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers $S$, ($1 \\leq S \\leq N$), and $T$, ($1 \\leq T \\leq N$), the source and destination of Tima\u2019s journey, respectively. Note: $S$ may be equal to $T$.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer denoting the total time Tima would take. If it is not possible for Tima to reach her destination using exactly $k_1$ red tracks, $k_2$ blue tracks, and any number of white tracks, output -1.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4 4 1 1\n1 2 1 2\n1 3 1 0\n2 4 1 1\n3 4 1 0\n1 4\nSample Output:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
