There are (n + 1) pylons numbered from 0 to n in this game. The pylon with number 0 has zero height, the pylon with number i (i > 0) has height h_{i}. The goal of the game is to reach n-th pylon, and the only move the player can do is to jump from the current pylon (let's denote its number as k) to the next one (its number will be k + 1). When the player have made such a move, its energy increases by h_{k} - h_{k} + 1 (if this value is negative the player loses energy). The player must have non-negative amount of energy at any moment of the time. \n\nInitially Caisa stand at 0 pylon and has 0 energy. The game provides a special opportunity: one can pay a single dollar and increase the height of anyone pylon by one. Caisa may use that opportunity several times, but he doesn't want to spend too much money. What is the minimal amount of money he must paid to reach the goal of the game?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The next line contains n integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1  \u2264  h_{i}  \u2264  10^5) representing the heights of the pylons.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number representing the minimum number of dollars paid by Caisa.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n3 4 3 2 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n3\n4 4 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample he can pay 4 dollars and increase the height of pylon with number 0 by 4 units. Then he can safely pass to the last pylon.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
