He has assigned to each letter a number that shows how much he likes that letter (he has assigned negative numbers to the letters he dislikes). \n\nB likes substrings. He especially likes the ones that start and end with the same letter (their length must exceed one).\n\nAlso, A and B have a string s. Now they are trying to find out how many substrings t of a string s are interesting to B (that is, t starts and ends with the same letter and its length is larger than one), and also the sum of values of all letters (assigned by A), except for the first and the last one is equal to zero.\n\nNaturally, A and B have quickly found the number of substrings t that are interesting to them. Can you do it? \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains 26 integers x_{a}, x_{b}, ..., x_{z} ( - 10^5 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the value assigned to letters a, b, c, ..., z respectively.\n\nThe second line contains string s of length between 1 and 10^5 characters, consisting of Lating lowercase letters\u2014 the string for which you need to calculate the answer. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the answer to the problem. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\nxabcab\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\naaa\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test strings satisfying the condition above are abca and bcab.\n\nIn the second sample test strings satisfying the condition above are two occurences of aa.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
