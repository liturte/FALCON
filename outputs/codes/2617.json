He is currently investigating the growth of bacteria.\n\nInitially, on day $1$, there is one bacterium with mass $1$.\n\nEvery day, some number of bacteria will split (possibly zero or all). When a bacterium of mass $m$ splits, it becomes two bacteria of mass $\\frac{m}{2}$ each. For example, a bacterium of mass $3$ can split into two bacteria of mass $1.5$.\n\nAlso, every night, the mass of every bacteria will increase by one.\n\nPhoenix is wondering if it is possible for the total mass of all the bacteria to be exactly $n$. If it is possible, he is interested in the way to obtain that mass using the minimum possible number of nights. Help him become the best scientist!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the sum of bacteria masses that Phoenix is interested in. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, if there is no way for the bacteria to exactly achieve total mass $n$, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain an integer $d$ \u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of nights needed.\n\nThe next line should contain $d$ integers, with the $i$-th integer representing the number of bacteria that should split on the $i$-th day.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n9\n11\n2\n\nOutput\n3\n1 0 2 \n3\n1 1 2\n1\n0 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $9$:   Day $1$: The bacterium with mass $1$ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $0.5$ each.  Night $1$: All bacteria's mass increases by one. There are now two bacteria with mass $1.5$.  Day $2$: None split.  Night $2$: There are now two bacteria with mass $2.5$.  Day $3$: Both bacteria split. There are now four bacteria with mass $1.25$.  Night $3$: There are now four bacteria with mass $2.25$.  The total mass is $2.25+2.25+2.25+2.25=9$. It can be proved that $3$ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 9 in 3 nights.\n\n$ $\n\nIn the second test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $11$:   Day $1$: The bacterium with mass $1$ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $0.5$.  Night $1$: There are now two bacteria with mass $1.5$.  Day $2$: One bacterium splits. There are now three bacteria with masses $0.75$, $0.75$, and $1.5$.  Night $2$: There are now three bacteria with masses $1.75$, $1.75$, and $2.5$.  Day $3$: The bacteria with mass $1.75$ and the bacteria with mass $2.5$ split. There are now five bacteria with masses $0.875$, $0.875$, $1.25$, $1.25$, and $1.75$.  Night $3$: There are now five bacteria with masses $1.875$, $1.875$, $2.25$, $2.25$, and $2.75$.  The total mass is $1.875+1.875+2.25+2.25+2.75=11$. It can be proved that $3$ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 11 in 3 nights.\n\n$ $\n\nIn the third test case, the bacterium does not split on day $1$, and then grows to mass $2$ during night $1$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
