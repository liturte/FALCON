If he has written the fastest solution on a problem he screams \u201cI\u2019m amazing\u201d in pure joy. However if his solution is not the fastest he likes to find out if he is the best Thore, or maybe the best ThoreH on the scoreboard. He is the best ThoreH if there is another Thore above him, but no ThoreH above him. Once a terrible incident took place where Thore misread the scoreboard and thought that he was the best, but instead it was some other Thore who was amazing. Now he needs your help to find the smallest prefix that uniquely determines himself on the scoreboard. \n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single number $n$, where $1 < n \\leq 100$.\n\nThen follows $n$ lines with a name on each line.\n\nEach name only contains characters from the set $\\big [\\text {a-zA-Z}\\big ]$, i.e. lower and upper case English letters. Each name is at least one character and at most $100$ characters long.\n\nExactly one name is \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is a single line. If \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d is first on the scoreboard, output \u201cThore is awesome\u201d. If another person, with a name containing \u201cThoreHusfeld\u201d(note: no trailing \u201ct\u201d) as a prefix is above Thore, output \u201cThore sucks\u201d.\n\nOtherwise output the smallest prefix that uniquely determines Thore on the scoreboard from the top. In other words: find the smallest prefix of \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d that no-one above \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d shares.\n\n-----Sample Explanation-----\nIn Sample Input $1$ there is another Thore above \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d. However, \u201cThoreHusfeldt\u201d is still the best \u201cThoreH\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2\nThoreTiemann\nThoreHusfeldt\nSample Output 1:\nThoreH\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\nThoreHusfeldt\nJohanSannemo\nSample Output 2:\nThore is awesome\n\nSample Input 3:\n2\nThoreHusfeldter\nThoreHusfeldt\nSample Output 3:\nThore sucks\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
