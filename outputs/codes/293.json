For example, in a 3 \u00d7 5 table there are 15 squares with side one, 8 squares with side two and 3 squares with side three. The total number of distinct squares in a 3 \u00d7 5 table is 15 + 8 + 3 = 26.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the number of squares inside the tables Spongebob is interested in.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFirst print a single integer k\u00a0\u2014 the number of tables with exactly x distinct squares inside.\n\nThen print k pairs of integers describing the tables.
