However, he is also too lazy to do his laundry in several rounds. He would much rather buy more laundry machines!\n\nEach of Luktas\u2019 socks have a color $D_ i$ which has a number between $0$ and $10^9$ assigned to it. After some experimentation, he found that he could wash any socks with a maximum absolute color difference of $K$ in the same machine without any discoloring. The color difference of two socks $i$ and $j$ is $|D_ i - D_ j|$.\n\nLuktas now needs to know how many washing machines he needs to wash his $S$ socks, given that each machine can take at most $C$ socks a time.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line consists of three integers $1 \\le S, C \\le 10^5$ and $0 \\le K \\le 10^9$, the number of socks, the capacity of a laundry machine and the maximum color difference, respectively. Then follow one line with $S$ integers; these are the color values $D_ i$ of every sock.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer; the number of machines Luktas needs to wash all his socks.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 3 0\n0 0 1 1 2\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
