Thieves and terrorists are always ready to ruin the country's peace. To fight back, Zane and Inzane have enacted a very effective law: from each city it must be possible to reach a police station by traveling at most d kilometers along the roads. [Image] \n\nThere are n cities in the country, numbered from 1 to n, connected only by exactly n - 1 roads. All roads are 1 kilometer long. It is initially possible to travel from a city to any other city using these roads. The country also has k police stations located in some cities. In particular, the city's structure satisfies the requirement enforced by the previously mentioned law. Also note that there can be multiple police stations in one city.\n\nHowever, Zane feels like having as many as n - 1 roads is unnecessary. The country is having financial issues, so it wants to minimize the road maintenance cost by shutting down as many roads as possible.\n\nHelp Zane find the maximum number of roads that can be shut down without breaking the law. Also, help him determine such roads.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, k, and d (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 d \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities, the number of police stations, and the distance limitation in kilometers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 each denoting the city each police station is located in.\n\nThe i-th of the following n - 1 lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i})\u00a0\u2014 the cities directly connected by the road with index i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to travel from one city to any other city using only the roads. Also, it is possible from any city to reach a police station within d kilometers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print one integer s that denotes the maximum number of roads that can be shut down.\n\nIn the second line, print s distinct integers, the indices of such roads, in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 2 4\n1 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n\nOutput\n1\n5\n\nInput\n6 3 2\n1 5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n5 6\n\nOutput\n2\n4 5 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, if you shut down road 5, all cities can still reach a police station within k = 4 kilometers.\n\nIn the second sample, although this is the only largest valid set of roads that can be shut down, you can print either 4 5 or 5 4 in the second line.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
