Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons: \n\n  Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces.  Cube. Cube has 6 square faces.  Octahedron. Octahedron has 8 triangular faces.  Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.  Icosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. \n\nAll five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:\n\n [Image] \n\nAnton has a collection of n polyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.\n\nEach of the following n lines of the input contains a string s_{i}\u00a0\u2014 the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:\n\n  \"Tetrahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.  \"Cube\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.  \"Octahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.  \"Dodecahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.  \"Icosahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one number\u00a0\u2014 the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\nIcosahedron\nCube\nTetrahedron\nDodecahedron\n\nOutput\n42\n\nInput\n3\nDodecahedron\nOctahedron\nOctahedron\n\nOutput\n28\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has 20 faces, cube has 6 faces, tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12 faces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
