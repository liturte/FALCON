For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nConsider a permutation $p$ of length $n$, we build a graph of size $n$ using it as follows:   For every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, find the largest $j$ such that $1 \\leq j < i$ and $p_j > p_i$, and add an undirected edge between node $i$ and node $j$  For every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, find the smallest $j$ such that $i < j \\leq n$ and $p_j > p_i$, and add an undirected edge between node $i$ and node $j$ \n\nIn cases where no such $j$ exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.\n\nFor clarity, consider as an example $n = 4$, and $p = [3,1,4,2]$; here, the edges of the graph are $(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3)$.\n\nA permutation $p$ is cyclic if the graph built using $p$ has at least one simple cycle. \n\nGiven $n$, find the number of cyclic permutations of length $n$. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\nPlease refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer $0 \\leq x < 10^9+7$, the number of cyclic permutations of length $n$ modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n16\nInput\n583291\n\nOutput\n135712853\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThere are $16$ cyclic permutations for $n = 4$. $[4,2,1,3]$ is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four: $4 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4$.\n\nNodes $v_1$, $v_2$, $\\ldots$, $v_k$ form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold:   $k \\geq 3$.  $v_i \\neq v_j$ for any pair of indices $i$ and $j$.
