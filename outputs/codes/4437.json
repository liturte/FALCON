Its positions are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nHe wants to modify his string so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'. To achieve that, Nikolay can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose some position in his string and replace the letter on this position with the other letter (i.e. replace 'a' with 'b' or replace 'b' with 'a'). Nikolay can use no letters except 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe prefix of string $s$ of length $l$ ($1 \\le l \\le n$) is a string $s[1..l]$.\n\nFor example, for the string $s=$\"abba\" there are two prefixes of the even length. The first is $s[1\\dots2]=$\"ab\" and the second $s[1\\dots4]=$\"abba\". Both of them have the same number of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string $s$ to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^{5})$ \u2014 the length of string $s$.\n\nThe second line of the input contains the string $s$ of length $n$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'a' and 'b'.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string $s$ to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.\n\nIn the second line print the string Nikolay obtains after applying all the operations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\nbbbb\n\nOutput\n2\nabba\n\nInput\n6\nababab\n\nOutput\n0\nababab\n\nInput\n2\naa\n\nOutput\n1\nba\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Nikolay has to perform two operations. For example, he can replace the first 'b' with 'a' and the last 'b' with 'a'. \n\nIn the second example Nikolay doesn't need to do anything because each prefix of an even length of the initial string already contains an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
