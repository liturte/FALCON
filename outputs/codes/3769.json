During his Mathematics of Olympiads (MoO) class, Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help. For two fixed integers k and p, where p is an odd prime number, the functional equation states that $f(k x \\operatorname{mod} p) \\equiv k \\cdot f(x) \\operatorname{mod} p$ \n\nfor some function $f : \\{0,1,2, \\cdots, p - 1 \\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1,2, \\cdots, p - 1 \\}$. (This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive.)\n\nIt turns out that f can actually be many different functions. Instead of finding a solution, Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation. Since the answer may be very large, you should print your result modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of two space-separated integers p and k (3 \u2264 p \u2264 1 000 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 p - 1) on a single line. It is guaranteed that p is an odd prime number.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the number of distinct functions f modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 4\n\nOutput\n25\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, p = 3 and k = 2. The following functions work:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2.  f(0) = 0, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1.  f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
