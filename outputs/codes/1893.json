The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.\n\nYou are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly 1.000000011 times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains a pair of integers n (1000 \u2264 n \u2264 10\u00a0000) and t (0 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed since the initial time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one number \u2014 the estimate of the number of transistors in a dence integrated circuit in t seconds since the initial time. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than 10^{ - 6}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1000 1000000\n\nOutput\n1011.060722383550382782399454922040\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
