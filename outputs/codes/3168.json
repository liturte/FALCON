Each node has an integer written inside it. If the number $X$ is written inside a node, then the numbers in its left subtree are less than $X$ and the numbers in its right subtree are greater than X. You will be given a sequence of integers between 1 and $N$ (inclusive) such that each number appears in the sequence exactly once. You are to create a binary search tree from the sequence, putting the first number in the root node and inserting every other number in order.\n\nWhen inserting a new number $Y$ in a tree, you first traverse the tree as if you were searching for $Y$. When you arrive at a node $Z$ such that you can\u2019t continue searching for $Y$, you put $Y$ as a left or right son of $Z$ depending on if $Z>Y$ or $Z<Y$, so that after the insertion the tree will still be a binary search tree. After the insertion you add the depth of $Y$ to a counter $C$ and print the value of $C$. The counter $C$ is set to $0$ in the beginning.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains the integer $N$ $(1 \\leq N \\leq 300000)$, the length of the sequence.\n\nThe remaining $N$ lines contain the numbers in the sequence, integers in the interval $[1, N]$. The numbers will be distinct.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $N$ integers each on its own line, the values of the counter $C$ after each number is inserted into the tree.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSample Output 1:\n0\n1\n3\n6\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n3\n2\n4\n1\n5\nSample Output 2:\n0\n1\n2\n4\n6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
