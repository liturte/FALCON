On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.\n\nA performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.\n\nLittle Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), then reverse a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r} so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k}, such that p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{k} and a_{p}_1 \u2264 a_{p}_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 a_{p}_{k}. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 1 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n10\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.\n\nIn the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
