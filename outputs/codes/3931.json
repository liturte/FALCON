Each bus has no intermediate stops. So each of the buses continuously runs along the route from one stop to the other and back. There is at most one bus running between a pair of stops.\n\nPolycarp made n trips on buses. About each trip the stop where he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The trips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes.\n\nIt is known that one trip on any bus costs a burles. In case when passenger makes a transshipment the cost of trip decreases to b burles (b < a). A passenger makes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with the stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be made with transshipment.\n\nFor example, if Polycarp made three consecutive trips: \"BerBank\" $\\rightarrow$ \"University\", \"University\" $\\rightarrow$ \"BerMall\", \"University\" $\\rightarrow$ \"BerBank\", then he payed a + b + a = 2a + b burles. From the BerBank he arrived to the University, where he made transshipment to the other bus and departed to the BerMall. Then he walked to the University and returned to the BerBank by bus.\n\nAlso Polycarp can buy no more than k travel cards. Each travel card costs f burles. The travel card for a single bus route makes free of charge any trip by this route (in both directions). Once purchased, a travel card can be used any number of times in any direction.\n\nWhat is the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today if he can buy no more than k travel cards?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains five integers n, a, b, k, f (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 b < a \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 f \u2264 1000) where:  n \u2014 the number of Polycarp trips,  a \u2014 the cost of a regualar single trip,  b \u2014 the cost of a trip after a transshipment,  k \u2014 the maximum number of travel cards Polycarp can buy,  f \u2014 the cost of a single travel card. \n\nThe following n lines describe the trips in the chronological order. Each line contains exactly two different words separated by a single space \u2014 the name of the start stop and the name of the finish stop of the trip. All names consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters and have lengths between 1 to 20 letters inclusive. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be considered different.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today, if he can purchase no more than k travel cards.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5 3 1 8\nBerBank University\nUniversity BerMall\nUniversity BerBank\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n4 2 1 300 1000\na A\nA aa\naa AA\nAA a\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Polycarp can buy travel card for the route \"BerBank $\\leftrightarrow$ University\" and spend 8 burles. Note that his second trip \"University\" $\\rightarrow$ \"BerMall\" was made after transshipment, so for this trip Polycarp payed 3 burles. So the minimum total sum equals to 8 + 3 = 11 burles.\n\nIn the second example it doesn't make sense to buy travel cards. Note that each of Polycarp trip (except the first) was made with transshipment. So the minimum total sum equals to 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 burles.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
