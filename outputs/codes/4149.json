You don't know the array $a$, but you know the array $b$ which is formed from it with the following sequence of operations:  Firstly, let the array $b$ be equal to the array $a$;  Secondly, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$:   if $a_i$ is a prime number, then one integer $p_{a_i}$ is appended to array $b$, where $p$ is an infinite sequence of prime numbers ($2, 3, 5, \\dots$);  otherwise (if $a_i$ is not a prime number), the greatest divisor of $a_i$ which is not equal to $a_i$ is appended to $b$;   Then the obtained array of length $2n$ is shuffled and given to you in the input. \n\nHere $p_{a_i}$ means the $a_i$-th prime number. The first prime $p_1 = 2$, the second one is $p_2 = 3$, and so on.\n\nYour task is to recover any suitable array $a$ that forms the given array $b$. It is guaranteed that the answer exists (so the array $b$ is obtained from some suitable array $a$). If there are multiple answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements in $a$.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $2n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_{2n}$ ($2 \\le b_i \\le 2750131$), where $b_i$ is the $i$-th element of $b$. $2750131$ is the $199999$-th prime number.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line of the output print $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($2 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) in any order \u2014 the array $a$ from which the array $b$ can be obtained using the sequence of moves given in the problem statement.
