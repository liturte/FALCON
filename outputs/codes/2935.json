Well, at least he wasn\u2019t beat up by the airline and he\u2019s received a voucher for one free flight between any two destinations he wishes.\n\nHe is already planning next year\u2019s trip. He plans to travel by car where necessary, but he may be using his free flight ticket for one leg of the trip. He asked for your help in his planning.\n\nHe can provide you a network of cities connected by roads, the amount it costs to buy gas for traveling between pairs of cities, and a list of available flights between some of those cities. Help Peter by finding the minimum amount of money he needs to spend to get from his hometown to next year\u2019s destination!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line lists five space-separated integers $n$, $m$, $f$, $s$, and $t$, denoting the number of cities $n$ ($0 < n \\le 50000$), the number of roads $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le 150000$), the number of flights $f$ ($0 \\le f \\le 1000$), the number $s$ ($0 \\le s < n$) of the city in which Peter\u2019s trip starts, and the number $t$ ($0 \\le t < n$) of the city Peter is trying to travel to. (Cities are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$.)\n\nThe first line is followed by $m$ lines, each describing one road. A road description contains three space-separated integers $i$, $j$, and $c$ ($0 \\le i, j < n, i \\ne j$ and $0 < c \\le 50000$), indicating there is a road connecting cities $i$ and $j$ that costs $c$ cents to travel. Roads can be used in either direction for the same cost. All road descriptions are unique.\n\nEach of the following $f$ lines contains a description of an available flight, which consists of two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ ($0 \\le u, v < n$, $u \\ne v$) denoting that a flight from city $u$ to city $v$ is available (though not from $v$ to $u$ unless listed elsewhere). All flight descriptions are unique.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum number of cents Peter needs to spend to get from his home town to the competition, using at most one flight. You may assume that there is a route on which Peter can reach his destination.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n8 11 1 0 5\n0 1 10\n0 2 10\n1 2 10\n2 6 40\n6 7 10\n5 6 10\n3 5 15\n3 6 40\n3 4 20\n1 4 20\n1 3 20\n4 7\nSample Output:\n45\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
