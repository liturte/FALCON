Each edge of the tree should be in exactly one path.\n\nHelp Remesses, find such a decomposition of the tree or derermine that there is no such decomposition.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$) the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$, $a_i \\neq b_i$)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there are no decompositions, print the only line containing \"No\".\n\nOtherwise in the first line print \"Yes\", and in the second line print the number of paths in the decomposition $m$. \n\nEach of the next $m$ lines should contain two integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$) denoting that one of the paths in the decomposition is the simple path between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$. \n\nEach pair of paths in the decomposition should have at least one common vertex, and each edge of the tree should be presented in exactly one path. You can print the paths and the ends of each path in arbitrary order.\n\nIf there are multiple decompositions, print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\nYes\n1\n1 4\n\nInput\n6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n3 6\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n\nOutput\nYes\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe tree from the first example is shown on the picture below: [Image] The number next to each edge corresponds to the path number in the decomposition. It is easy to see that this decomposition suits the required conditions.\n\nThe tree from the second example is shown on the picture below: [Image] We can show that there are no valid decompositions of this tree.\n\nThe tree from the third example is shown on the picture below: [Image] The number next to each edge corresponds to the path number in the decomposition.
