But most of all he adores strings of length n.\n\nOne day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:  The string consists of n lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals n), exactly k of these letters are distinct.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, then the following inequality holds, s_{i} \u2260 s_{i} + 1(1 \u2264 i < n).  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest. \n\nHelp him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.\n\nString x = x_1x_2... x_{p} is lexicographically less than string y = y_1y_2... y_{q}, if either p < q and x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{p} = y_{p}, or there is such number r (r < p, r < q), that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{r} = y_{r} and x_{r} + 1 < y_{r} + 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nA single line contains two positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) \u2014 the string's length and the number of distinct letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the required string. If there isn't such string, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 4\n\nOutput\nababacd\n\nInput\n4 7\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
