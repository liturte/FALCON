For example, $[1]$, $[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$, $[3, 2, 1]$\u00a0\u2014 are permutations, and $[1, 1]$, $[4, 3, 1]$, $[2, 3, 4]$\u00a0\u2014 no.\n\nPermutation $a$ is lexicographically smaller than permutation $b$ (they have the same length $n$), if in the first index $i$ in which they differ, $a[i] < b[i]$. For example, the permutation $[1, 3, 2, 4]$ is lexicographically smaller than the permutation $[1, 3, 4, 2]$, because the first two elements are equal, and the third element in the first permutation is smaller than in the second.\n\nThe next permutation for a permutation $a$ of length $n$\u00a0\u2014 is the lexicographically smallest permutation $b$ of length $n$ that lexicographically larger than $a$. For example:   for permutation $[2, 1, 4, 3]$ the next permutation is $[2, 3, 1, 4]$;  for permutation $[1, 2, 3]$ the next permutation is $[1, 3, 2]$;  for permutation $[2, 1]$ next permutation does not exist. \n\nYou are given the number $n$\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial permutation. The initial permutation has the form $a = [1, 2, \\ldots, n]$. In other words, $a[i] = i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$).\n\nYou need to process $q$ queries of two types:   $1$ $l$ $r$: query for the sum of all elements on the segment $[l, r]$. More formally, you need to find $a[l] + a[l + 1] + \\ldots + a[r]$.  $2$ $x$: $x$ times replace the current permutation with the next permutation. For example, if $x=2$ and the current permutation has the form $[1, 3, 4, 2]$, then we should perform such a chain of replacements $[1, 3, 4, 2] \\rightarrow [1, 4, 2, 3] \\rightarrow [1, 4, 3, 2]$. \n\nFor each query of the $1$-st type output the required sum.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) and $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $n$\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial permutation, and $q$\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe next $q$ lines contain a single query of the $1$-st or $2$-nd type. The $1$-st type query consists of three integers $1$, $l$ and $r$ $(1 \\le l \\le r \\le n)$, the $2$-nd type query consists of two integers $2$ and $x$ $(1 \\le x \\le 10^5)$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all requests of the $2$-nd type are possible to process.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query of the $1$-st type, output on a separate line one integer\u00a0\u2014 the required sum.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4 4\n1 2 4\n2 3\n1 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput\n9\n4\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nInitially, the permutation has the form $[1, 2, 3, 4]$. Queries processing is as follows:   $2 + 3 + 4 = 9$;  $[1, 2, 3, 4] \\rightarrow [1, 2, 4, 3] \\rightarrow [1, 3, 2, 4] \\rightarrow [1, 3, 4, 2]$;  $1 + 3 = 4$;  $4 + 2 = 6$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
