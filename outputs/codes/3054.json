This will require counting the syllables in the words of the text, which should be done according to the following rules:\n - A word consists of a non-empty, maximal string of zero or more alphabetic characters (upper and/or lower-case) followed by zero or more non-blank, non-alphabetic characters.\n - Upper/lower case distinctions are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.\n - Non-alphabetic characters are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.\n - The characters \u2018A\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, \u2018I\u2019, \u2018O\u2019, \u2018U\u2019, and \u2018Y\u2019 are vowels. All other alphabetic characters are consonants.\n\nExceptions to this rule:\n - The character sequence \u201cQU\u201d is considered to be a single consonant.\n - The letter \u2018Y\u2019 is considered to be a consonant if it is immediately followed by one of the other vowels.\n - Every word has at least one syllable.\n\nFor example, \u201cFly\u201d,\u201cI\u201d, \u201c!?\u201d, and \u201cSsshhh!\u201d are words of one syllable.\n - Each (maximal) string of one or more consonants with at least one vowel to either side indicates a division into separate syllables.\n\nFor example, \u201cstrong\u201d has one syllable, \u201cstronger\u201d has $2$, and \u201cbookkeeper\u201d has $3$. \u201cplayer\u201d has two syllables (because the \u2018y\u2019, being followed by an \u2018e\u2019, is considered a consonant).\n\nExceptions to this rule are:\n - An \u2018E\u2019 appearing as the last alphabetic character in a word is silent and should be ignored unless the next-to-last alphabetic character is an \u2018L\u2019 and the character immediately before that is another consonant.\n\nFor example, \u201ccake\u201d, \u201cale\u201d and \u201cpale\u201d have one syllable. \u201cable\u201d has two.\n - An \u2018ES\u2019 sequence at the end of the alphabetic sequence in a word does not add a syllable unless immediately preceded by two or more consonants.\n\nFor example, \u201cales\u201d and \u201cpales\u201d have one syllable. \u201cwitches\u201d and \u201cverses\u201d have two.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput will consist of a single line of text consisting of a sequence of one or more words (as defined above) separated by single blanks.\n\nThe total line length will not exceed $200$ characters.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the words in the input line can be divided into a haiku, then print the haiku as three lines of output.\n - Each line should be left-justified.\n - A single space should separate each pair of words within a line.\n - Upper/lower casing from the input should be preserved.\n - Non-alphabetic characters terminating each word should be preserved.\n - A word cannot be split across multiple lines.\n\nIf the words in the input cannot be divided into a haiku, print the line of input with no changes.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nBlue Ridge mountain road. Leaves, glowing in autumn sun, fall in Virginia.\nSample Output 1:\nBlue Ridge mountain road.\nLeaves, glowing in autumn sun,\nfall in Virginia.\n\nSample Input 2:\nWho would know if we had too few syllables?\nSample Output 2:\nWho would know if we had too few syllables?\n\nSample Input 3:\nInternational contest- motivation high Programmers have fun!.\nSample Output 3:\nInternational\ncontest- motivation high\nProgrammers have fun!.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
