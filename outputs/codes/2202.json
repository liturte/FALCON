The encryption has several levels of security, and here is how the first one looks.\n\nHeidi is presented with a screen that shows her a sequence of integers A and a positive integer p. She knows that the encryption code is a single number S, which is defined as follows:\n\nDefine the score of X to be the sum of the elements of X modulo p.\n\nHeidi is given a sequence A that consists of N integers, and also given an integer p. She needs to split A into 2 parts such that:   Each part contains at least 1 element of A, and each part consists of contiguous elements of A.  The two parts do not overlap.  The total sum S of the scores of those two parts is maximized. This is the encryption code. \n\nOutput the sum S, which is the encryption code.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integer N and p (2 \u2264 N \u2264 100 000, 2 \u2264 p \u2264 10 000) \u2013 the number of elements in A, and the modulo for computing scores, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers which are the elements of A. Each integer is from the interval [1, 1 000 000].\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the number S as described in the problem statement.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 10\n3 4 7 2\n\nOutput\n16\n\nInput\n10 12\n16 3 24 13 9 8 7 5 12 12\n\nOutput\n13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the score is maximized if the input sequence is split into two parts as (3, 4), (7, 2). It gives the total score of $(3 + 4 \\operatorname{mod} 10) +(7 + 2 \\operatorname{mod} 10) = 16$.\n\nIn the second example, the score is maximized if the first part consists of the first three elements, and the second part consists of the rest. Then, the score is $(16 + 3 + 24 \\operatorname{mod} 12) +(13 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 12 + 12 \\operatorname{mod} 12) = 7 + 6 = 13$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
