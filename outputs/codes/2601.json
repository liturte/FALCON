It is literally your only purpose! Walking onto buttons! How can you not do the one thing you were designed for?\n\nOh, that's funny, is it? Oh it's funny? Because we've been at this for twelve hours and you haven't solved it either, so I don't know why you're laughing. You've got one hour! Solve it!  \n\nWheatley decided to try to make a test chamber. He made a nice test chamber, but there was only one detail absent\u00a0\u2014 cubes.\n\nFor completing the chamber Wheatley needs $n$ cubes. $i$-th cube has a volume $a_i$.\n\nWheatley has to place cubes in such a way that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume. Formally, for each $i>1$, $a_{i-1} \\le a_i$ must hold.\n\nTo achieve his goal, Wheatley can exchange two neighbouring cubes. It means that for any $i>1$ you can exchange cubes on positions $i-1$ and $i$.\n\nBut there is a problem: Wheatley is very impatient. If Wheatley needs more than $\\frac{n \\cdot (n-1)}{2}-1$ exchange operations, he won't do this boring work.\n\nWheatly wants to know: can cubes be sorted under this conditions?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one positive integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 number of cubes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ positive integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 volumes of cubes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a word in a single line: \"YES\" (without quotation marks) if the cubes can be sorted and \"NO\" (without quotation marks) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5\n5 3 2 1 4\n6\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2\n2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case it is possible to sort all the cubes in $7$ exchanges.\n\nIn the second test case the cubes are already sorted.\n\nIn the third test case we can make $0$ exchanges, but the cubes are not sorted yet, so the answer is \"NO\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
