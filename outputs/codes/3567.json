Each player has a character with some features. There are a total of $k$ features, and each character has some subset of them. \n\nThe similarity between two characters $A$ and $B$ is calculated as follows: for each feature $f$, if both $A$ and $B$ have feature $f$ or if none of them have feature $f$, the similarity increases by one.\n\nTira does not have a character yet. She would like to create a new, very original character so that the maximum similarity between Tira\u2019s character and any other character is as low as possible.\n\nGiven the characters of the other players, your task is to create a character for Tira that fulfils the above requirement. If there are many possible characters, you can choose any of them.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$, where $1 \\le n \\le 10^5$ is the number of players (excluding Tira) and $1 \\le k \\le 20$ is the number of features.\n\nThen follow $n$ lines describing the existing characters. Each of these $n$ lines contains a string of $k$ digits which are either $0$ or $1$. A $1$ in position $j$ means the character has the $j$\u2019th feature, and a $0$ means that it does not have the $j$\u2019th feature.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line describing the features of Tira\u2019s character in the same format as in the input. If there are multiple possible characters with the same smallest maximum similarity, any one of them will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 5\n01001\n11100\n10111\nSample Output:\n00010\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
