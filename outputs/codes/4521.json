The $i$-th point is located at the integer point $x_i$ and has a speed $v_i$. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All $n$ points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the $i$-th point at the moment $t$ ($t$ can be non-integer) is calculated as $x_i + t \\cdot v_i$.\n\nConsider two points $i$ and $j$. Let $d(i, j)$ be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points $i$ and $j$ coincide at some moment, the value $d(i, j)$ will be $0$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the value $\\sum\\limits_{1 \\le i < j \\le n}$ $d(i, j)$ (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of points.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ ($1 \\le x_i \\le 10^8$), where $x_i$ is the initial coordinate of the $i$-th point.
