He's got n supply-line filters to plug the devices, the i-th supply-line filter has a_{i} sockets.\n\nOverall Vasya has got m devices and k electrical sockets in his flat, he can plug the devices or supply-line filters directly. Of course, he can plug the supply-line filter to any other supply-line filter. The device (or the supply-line filter) is considered plugged to electricity if it is either plugged to one of k electrical sockets, or if it is plugged to some supply-line filter that is in turn plugged to electricity. \n\nWhat minimum number of supply-line filters from the given set will Vasya need to plug all the devices he has to electricity? Note that all devices and supply-line filters take one socket for plugging and that he can use one socket to plug either one device or one supply-line filter.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n, m, k \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of supply-line filters, the number of devices and the number of sockets that he can plug to directly, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 50) \u2014 number a_{i} stands for the number of sockets on the i-th supply-line filter.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the minimum number of supply-line filters that is needed to plug all the devices to electricity. If it is impossible to plug all the devices even using all the supply-line filters, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5 3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 7 2\n3 3 2 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5 5 1\n1 3 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case he can plug the first supply-line filter directly to electricity. After he plug it, he get 5 (3 on the supply-line filter and 2 remaining sockets for direct plugging) available sockets to plug. Thus, one filter is enough to plug 5 devices.\n\nOne of the optimal ways in the second test sample is to plug the second supply-line filter directly and plug the fourth supply-line filter to one of the sockets in the second supply-line filter. Thus, he gets exactly 7 sockets, available to plug: one to plug to the electricity directly, 2 on the second supply-line filter, 4 on the fourth supply-line filter. There's no way he can plug 7 devices if he use one supply-line filter.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
