The difference between versions is the constraints on $n$ and $a_i$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has $x$ candies. There are also $n$ enemies numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$. Enemy $i$ has $a_i$ candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation $P$. A permutation is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $\\{2,3,1,5,4\\}$ is a permutation, but $\\{1,2,2\\}$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $\\{1,3,4\\}$ is also not a permutation (because $n=3$ but there is the number $4$ in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do $n$ duels with the enemies with the following rules:  If Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy $P_i$, she wins the duel and gets $1$ candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing.  The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels. \n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations $P$ exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define $f(x)$ as the number of valid permutations for the integer $x$.\n\nYou are given $n$, $a$ and a prime number $p \\le n$. Let's call a positive integer $x$ good, if the value $f(x)$ is not divisible by $p$. Find all good integers $x$.\n\nYour task is to solve this problem made by Akari.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$, $p$ $(2 \\le p \\le n \\le 2000)$. It is guaranteed, that the number $p$ is prime (it has exactly two divisors $1$ and $p$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ $(1 \\le a_i \\le 2000)$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print the number of good integers $x$.\n\nIn the second line, output all good integers $x$ in the ascending order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the number of good integers $x$ does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n3 4 5\n\nOutput\n1\n3\n\nInput\n4 3\n2 3 5 6\n\nOutput\n2\n3 4\n\nInput\n4 3\n9 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, $p=2$.  If $x \\le 2$, there are no valid permutations for Yuzu. So $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\le 2$. The number $0$ is divisible by $2$, so all integers $x \\leq 2$ are not good.  If $x = 3$, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is the only valid permutation for Yuzu. So $f(3)=1$, so the number $3$ is good.  If $x = 4$, $\\{1,2,3\\} , \\{1,3,2\\} , \\{2,1,3\\} , \\{2,3,1\\}$ are all valid permutations for Yuzu. So $f(4)=4$, so the number $4$ is not good.  If $x \\ge 5$, all $6$ permutations are valid for Yuzu. So $f(x)=6$ for all $x \\ge 5$, so all integers $x \\ge 5$ are not good. \n\nSo, the only good number is $3$.\n\nIn the third test, for all positive integers $x$ the value $f(x)$ is divisible by $p = 3$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
