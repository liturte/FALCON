You can also assume that you don't put the same book on the shelf twice, so $id$s don't repeat in queries of first two types.\n\nYour problem is to answer all the queries of type $3$ in order they appear in the input.\n\nNote that after answering the query of type $3$ all the books remain on the shelf and the relative order of books does not change.\n\nIf you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThen $q$ lines follow.
