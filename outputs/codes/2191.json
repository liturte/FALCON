The game consists of several sets, and each set consists of several rounds. Each round is won either by Alice or by Bob, and the set ends when one of the players has won $x$ rounds in a row. For example, if Bob won five rounds in a row and $x = 2$, then two sets ends.\n\nYou know that Alice and Bob have already played $n$ rounds, and you know the results of some rounds. For each $x$ from $1$ to $n$, calculate the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins $x$ rounds in a row. It is possible that the last set is still not finished \u2014 in that case, you should not count it in the answer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rounds.\n\nThe second line contains one string $s$ of length $n$ \u2014 the descriptions of rounds. If the $i$-th element of the string is 0, then Alice won the $i$-th round; if it is 1, then Bob won the $i$-th round, and if it is ?, then you don't know who won the $i$-th round.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print $n$ integers. The $i$-th integer should be equal to the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins $i$ rounds in a row.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n11?000\n\nOutput\n6 3 2 1 0 0 \n\nInput\n5\n01?01\n\nOutput\n5 1 0 0 0 \n\nInput\n12\n???1??????1?\n\nOutput\n12 6 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first test case:\n\n  if $x = 1$ and $s = 110000$ or $s = 111000$ then there are six finished sets;  if $x = 2$ and $s = 110000$ then there are three finished sets;  if $x = 3$ and $s = 111000$ then there are two finished sets;  if $x = 4$ and $s = 110000$ then there is one finished set;  if $x = 5$ then there are no finished sets;  if $x = 6$ then there are no finished sets.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
