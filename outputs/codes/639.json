He decided to give them some problems to let them go.\n\nDr. Evil is interested in sets, He has a set of n integers. Dr. Evil calls a set of integers evil if the MEX of it is exactly x. the MEX of a set of integers is the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't exist in it. For example, the MEX of the set {0, 2, 4} is 1 and the MEX of the set {1, 2, 3} is 0 .\n\nDr. Evil is going to make his set evil. To do this he can perform some operations. During each operation he can add some non-negative integer to his set or erase some element from it. What is the minimal number of operations Dr. Evil has to perform to make his set evil?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the set Dr. Evil owns, and the desired MEX.\n\nThe second line contains n distinct non-negative integers not exceeding 100 that represent the set.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line should contain one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of operations Dr. Evil should perform.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 3\n0 4 5 6 7\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 0\n0\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5 0\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case Dr. Evil should add 1 and 2 to the set performing 2 operations.\n\nFor the second test case Dr. Evil should erase 0 from the set. After that, the set becomes empty, so the MEX of it is 0.\n\nIn the third test case the set is already evil.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
