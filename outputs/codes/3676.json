You never know what you\u2019re gonna get.\"\n\n\nForrest Gump is a young boy who goes to Greenbow County Central School. As a child, he enjoys running, dancing by swinging his hips, and eating chocolates. Most of all, he enjoys spending time with his best friend Jenny. However, Forrest isn\u2019t the brightest boy by conventional means. While he fully embraces the life wisdom that his mama often imparts (such as through analogies with boxes of chocolates), he still has trouble keeping up with his classes.\n\n\nForrest\u2019s math class is currently learning about shapes, specifically polygons. Forrest is falling behind because he doesn\u2019t really understand what a polygon is. Jenny knows that if Forrest doesn\u2019t keep up, his mama would have to take drastic measures to prevent the crooked principal, Mr. Hancock, from transferring Forrest to a special school. As such, Jenny has decided take Forrest\u2019s schooling into her own hands.\n\n\nJenny has decided to use something that Forrest understands to explain polygons to him. She picks up a box of square chocolates and empties the pieces onto a napkin, leaving an empty box with $R$ rows and $C$ columns of empty cells. She places a single piece of chocolate in the box and says \u201cWith one chocolate here, I\u2019ve made a square. A square is a polygon, Forrest.\"\n\nJenny added two more chocolates around the first one and said, \u201cWe still have here a polygon, because we can trace a border around the chocolates without our fingers leaving the surface of the box.\"\n\nJenny adds some more chocolates, filling up the entire box except a hole in the middle. \u201cNow Forrest, no matter how we trace the outside box, there will always be a hole we can never draw unless our finger leaves the surface. So this here ain\u2019t a polygon.\"\n\nJenny removes a chocolate from the corner and says, \u201cNow we\u2019re back to a polygon again! As long as we can trace the border of our chocolates without crossing over where we already traced, we have ourselves here a polygon. As we trace, we can even have two corners barely touch, so long as we don\u2019t overlap any border line we\u2019ve already gone over.\".\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing Jenny. Even with just a small box like that, it seems like you can make so many of \u2019em\", said Forrest.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Forrest!\", said Jenny. \u201cThere\u2019s so many ways to make a polygon using this box of chocolates, if I just made one at random and had you guess, you truly are never gonna know what you\u2019re gonna get!\"\n\n\n\u201cWell, Jenny. Just how many ways do you think are there?\" asked Forrest.\n\n\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not quite sure about that Forrest.\" Jenny thought for a moment. \"You really have me stumped.\"\n\n\nJenny wants to impress Forrest with the answer. Given the dimensions of the chocolate box, can you help her count the number of ways? For example, a $2$ by $2$ chocolate box has $13$ ways of forming a polygon:\n\n   x.   .x   ..   ..   xx   x.   ..   .x   xx   .x   xx   x.   xx ..   ..   x.   .x   ..   x.   xx   .x   x.   xx   .x   xx   xx\n\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first and only line of input consists of two space-separated integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \\leq R, C \\leq 4$), specifying the dimensions of the box of chocolates.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint, on a single line, the number of different ways that chocolates can form a single polygon in the box. Note that if the same polygon can be placed at multiple different places in the box, then all of those ways are counted separately towards the answer.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1 2\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
