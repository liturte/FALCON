The i-th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from 0 to a_{i} ml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered by i-th tap has temperature t_{i}.\n\nIf for every $i \\in [ 1, n ]$ you set i-th tap to deliver exactly x_{i} ml of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be $\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_{i} t_{i}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_{i}}$ (if $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_{i} = 0$, then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is 0).\n\nYou have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactly T. What is the maximum amount of water you may get per second if its temperature has to be T?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of water taps and the desired temperature of water, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6) where a_{i} is the maximum amount of water i-th tap can deliver per second.\n\nThe third line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the temperature of water each tap delivers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible amount of water with temperature exactly T you can get per second (if it is impossible to obtain water with such temperature, then the answer is considered to be 0).\n\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 100\n3 10\n50 150\n\nOutput\n6.000000000000000\n\nInput\n3 9\n5 5 30\n6 6 10\n\nOutput\n40.000000000000000\n\nInput\n2 12\n1 3\n10 15\n\nOutput\n1.666666666666667\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
