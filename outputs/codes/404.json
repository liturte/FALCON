He is sorting through the numbers $a$ from $1$ to $10^{18}$, and for every $a$ writes $\\frac{[a, \\,\\, b]}{a}$ on blackboard. Here $[a, \\,\\, b]$ stands for least common multiple of $a$ and $b$. Ivan is very lazy, that's why this task bored him soon. But he is interested in how many different numbers he would write on the board if he would finish the task. Help him to find the quantity of different numbers he would write on the board.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains one integer\u00a0\u2014 $b$ $(1 \\le b \\le 10^{10})$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number\u00a0\u2014 answer for the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example $[a, \\,\\, 1] = a$, therefore $\\frac{[a, \\,\\, b]}{a}$ is always equal to $1$.\n\nIn the second example $[a, \\,\\, 2]$ can be equal to $a$ or $2 \\cdot a$ depending on parity of $a$. $\\frac{[a, \\,\\, b]}{a}$ can be equal to $1$ and $2$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
