However, a character cannot be removed if removal of the character would result in two neighboring equal characters in s.\nThe player who becomes unable to perform the operation, loses the game. Determine which player will win when the two play optimally.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 3 \u2264 |s| \u2264 10^5\n - s consists of lowercase English letters.\n - No two neighboring characters in s are equal.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\ns\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Takahashi will win, print First.
