We know that many participants use random numbers in their programs and are often sent several solutions with the same source code to check.\n\nEach participant is identified by some unique positive integer k, and each sent solution A is characterized by two numbers: x\u00a0\u2014 the number of different solutions that are sent before the first solution identical to A, and k \u2014 the number of the participant, who is the author of the solution. Consequently, all identical solutions have the same x.\n\nIt is known that the data in the testing system are stored in the chronological order, that is, if the testing system has a solution with number x (x > 0) of the participant with number k, then the testing system has a solution with number x - 1 of the same participant stored somewhere before.\n\nDuring the competition the checking system crashed, but then the data of the submissions of all participants have been restored. Now the jury wants to verify that the recovered data is in chronological order. Help the jury to do so.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of solutions. Each of the following n lines contains two integers separated by space x and k (0 \u2264 x \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of previous unique solutions and the identifier of the participant.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nA single line of the output should contain \u00abYES\u00bb if the data is in chronological order, and \u00abNO\u00bb otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n0 1\n1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n4\n0 1\n1 2\n1 1\n0 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n4\n0 1\n1 1\n0 1\n0 2\n\nOutput\nYES\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
