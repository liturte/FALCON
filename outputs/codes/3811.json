WCD may not exist for some lists.\n\nFor example, if the list looks like $[(12, 15), (25, 18), (10, 24)]$, then their WCD can be equal to $2$, $3$, $5$ or $6$ (each of these numbers is strictly greater than $1$ and divides at least one number in each pair).\n\nYou're currently pursuing your PhD degree under Ildar's mentorship, and that's why this problem was delegated to you. Your task is to calculate WCD efficiently.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 150\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integer values $a_i$, $b_i$ ($2 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the WCD of the set of pairs. \n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, output any; if there is no answer, print $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n17 18\n15 24\n12 15\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2\n10 16\n7 17\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n5\n90 108\n45 105\n75 40\n165 175\n33 30\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the answer is $6$ since it divides $18$ from the first pair, $24$ from the second and $12$ from the third ones. Note that other valid answers will also be accepted.\n\nIn the second example there are no integers greater than $1$ satisfying the conditions.\n\nIn the third example one of the possible answers is $5$. Note that, for example, $15$ is also allowed, but it's not necessary to maximize the output.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
