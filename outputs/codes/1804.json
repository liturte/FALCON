C friends are staying at C hotels located at some street-avenue crossings. They are going to celebrate birthday of one of them in the one of H restaurants also located at some street-avenue crossings. They also want that the maximum distance covered by one of them while traveling to the restaurant to be minimum possible. Help friends choose optimal restaurant for a celebration.\n\nSuppose that the distance between neighboring crossings are all the same equal to one kilometer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers N \u0438 M\u00a0\u2014 size of the city (1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 10^9). In the next line there is a single integer C (1 \u2264 C \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of hotels friends stayed at. Following C lines contain descriptions of hotels, each consisting of two coordinates x and y (1 \u2264 x \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 M). The next line contains an integer H\u00a0\u2014 the number of restaurants (1 \u2264 H \u2264 10^5). Following H lines contain descriptions of restaurants in the same format.\n\nSeveral restaurants and hotels may be located near the same crossing.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line output the optimal distance. In the next line output index of a restaurant that produces this optimal distance. If there are several possibilities, you are allowed to output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 10\n2\n1 1\n3 3\n2\n1 10\n4 4\n\nOutput\n6\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
