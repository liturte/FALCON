The marathon race starts at the stadium that can be represented on the plane as a square whose lower left corner is located at point with coordinates (0, 0) and the length of the side equals a meters. The sides of the square are parallel to coordinate axes.\n\nAs the length of the marathon race is very long, Valera needs to have extra drink during the race. The coach gives Valera a bottle of drink each d meters of the path. We know that Valera starts at the point with coordinates (0, 0) and runs counter-clockwise. That is, when Valera covers a meters, he reaches the point with coordinates (a, 0). We also know that the length of the marathon race equals nd + 0.5 meters. \n\nHelp Valera's coach determine where he should be located to help Valera. Specifically, determine the coordinates of Valera's positions when he covers d, 2\u00b7d, ..., n\u00b7d meters.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated real numbers a and d (1 \u2264 a, d \u2264 10^5), given with precision till 4 decimal digits after the decimal point. Number a denotes the length of the square's side that describes the stadium. Number d shows that after each d meters Valera gets an extra drink.\n\nThe second line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) showing that Valera needs an extra drink n times.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n lines, each line should contain two real numbers x_{i} and y_{i}, separated by a space. Numbers x_{i} and y_{i} in the i-th line mean that Valera is at point with coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) after he covers i\u00b7d meters. Your solution will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 4}.\n\nNote, that this problem have huge amount of output data. Please, do not use cout stream for output in this problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 5\n2\n\nOutput\n1.0000000000 2.0000000000\n2.0000000000 0.0000000000\n\nInput\n4.147 2.8819\n6\n\nOutput\n2.8819000000 0.0000000000\n4.1470000000 1.6168000000\n3.7953000000 4.1470000000\n0.9134000000 4.1470000000\n0.0000000000 2.1785000000\n0.7034000000 0.0000000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
