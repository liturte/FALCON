An edge of a connected graph is called a bridge, if after removing it the graph is being split into two connected components.\n\nBuild a connected undirected k-regular graph containing at least one bridge, or else state that such graph doesn't exist.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the required degree of the vertices of the regular graph.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"NO\" (without quotes), if such graph doesn't exist. \n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line and the description of any suitable graph in the next lines.\n\nThe description of the made graph must start with numbers n and m \u2014 the number of vertices and edges respectively. \n\nEach of the next m lines must contain two integers, a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n, a \u2260 b), that mean that there is an edge connecting the vertices a and b. A graph shouldn't contain multiple edges and edges that lead from a vertex to itself. A graph must be connected, the degrees of all vertices of the graph must be equal k. At least one edge of the graph must be a bridge. You can print the edges of the graph in any order. You can print the ends of each edge in any order.\n\nThe constructed graph must contain at most 10^6 vertices and 10^6 edges (it is guaranteed that if at least one graph that meets the requirements exists, then there also exists the graph with at most 10^6 vertices and at most 10^6 edges). \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n2 1\n1 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the sample from the statement there is a suitable graph consisting of two vertices, connected by a single edge.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
