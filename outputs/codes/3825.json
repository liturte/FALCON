There are digits I, V, X, L which correspond to the numbers $1$, $5$, $10$ and $50$ respectively. The use of other roman digits is not allowed.\n\nNumbers in this system are written as a sequence of one or more digits. We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it.\n\nFor example, the number XXXV evaluates to $35$ and the number IXI\u00a0\u2014 to $12$.\n\nPay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system\u00a0\u2014 in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for example IX means $11$, not $9$.\n\nOne can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented by exactly $n$ roman digits I, V, X, L.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input file contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of roman digits to use.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of distinct integers which can be represented using $n$ roman digits exactly.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n10\n\nOutput\n244\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample there are exactly $4$ integers which can be represented\u00a0\u2014 I, V, X and L.\n\nIn the second sample it is possible to represent integers $2$ (II), $6$ (VI), $10$ (VV), $11$ (XI), $15$ (XV), $20$ (XX), $51$ (IL), $55$ (VL), $60$ (XL) and $100$ (LL).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
