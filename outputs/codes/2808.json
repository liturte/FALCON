The train has $n$ cars ordered sequentially starting from the locomotive. The $i$-th car has $p_ i$ passengers. There are $m$ food carts Peter may put into service. Each food cart serves a unique type of food. The $j$-th food cart can move between the $l_ j$-th car and the $r_ j$-th car (both inclusive) and serve the passengers in these cars.\n\nThe passengers on the train are not only hungry, but also adventurous: as long as a food cart is in service, they would love to try it! A passenger will be happy if he/she sits in a car that is served by all the food carts that are in service. Peter would like to design service plans that run one or more of the $m$ food carts so that at least $k$ of the passengers on the train are happy.\n\nPeter wants to count the number of different service plans he may choose from (modulo $10^9 + 7$). Two service plans are different if one food cart is put into service in one plan but not in the other plan.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line has three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{14}$). The next line has $n$ integers. The $i$-th integer is $p_ i$ ($1 \\leq p_ i \\leq 10^9 $), the number of passengers in the $i$-th car. Each of the next $m$ lines describes a food cart. The $j$-th of these lines has two integers $l_ j$ and $r_ j$ ($1 \\leq l_ j \\leq r_ j \\leq n$), giving the service range of the $j$-th food cart.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of different service plans, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4 3 3\n1 2 3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\nSample Output 1:\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 4 6\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 4\n2 3\n3 5\n4 5\nSample Output 2:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
