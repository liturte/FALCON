Its sum of digits was not less than k. But you were distracted a bit, and someone changed this number to n, replacing some digits with others. It's known that the length of the number didn't change.\n\nYou have to find the minimum number of digits in which these two numbers can differ.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe second line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n < 10^100000).\n\nThere are no leading zeros in n. It's guaranteed that this situation is possible.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum number of digits in which the initial number and n can differ.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n11\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n99\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the initial number could be 12.\n\nIn the second example the sum of the digits of n is not less than k. The initial number could be equal to n.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
