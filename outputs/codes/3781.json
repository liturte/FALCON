(The chosen dish may already have coins on it, or not.)\n - When no bag contains coins: Choose one dish with coin(s) on it, then remove one or more coins from the chosen dish.\nThe player who first becomes unable to make a move loses. Determine the winner of the game when the two players play optimally.\nYou are given T test cases.

Below is one sequence of moves that results in Jiro's win:\n - In Taro the first's turn, he can only choose Bag 1 and move the coins onto Dish 1.\n - In Jiro the second's turn, he can choose Dish 1 and remove all coins from it, making Taro fail to make a move and lose.\n - Note that when there is a bag that contains coin(s), a player can only make a move in which he chooses a bag that contains coin(s) and moves the coin(s) onto a dish.\n - Similarly, note that when there is no bag that contains coin(s), a player can only make a move in which he chooses a dish and removes one or more coins.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
