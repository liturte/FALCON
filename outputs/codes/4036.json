But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in $k$ days. It means that Polycarp has exactly $k$ days for training!\n\nPolycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of $k$ days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve no more than $2x$ problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve at least $x+1$ problem during the next day.\n\nMore formally: let $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k]$ be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The $i$-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the $i$-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied:   sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$;  $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$;  the condition $a_i < a_{i + 1} \\le 2 a_i$ should be satisfied for each $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$. \n\nYour problem is to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9, 1 \\le k \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve and the number of days Polycarp wants to train.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying Polycarp's rules of training, print \"NO\" in the first line.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" in the first line, then print $k$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ in the second line, where $a_i$ should be the number of problems Polycarp should solve during the $i$-th day. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n26 6\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 4 5 6 8 \n\nInput\n8 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 \n\nInput\n9 4\n\nOutput\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
