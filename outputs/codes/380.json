The goal is to make a simple polyline, without self-intersections and self-touches, such that it passes through all these points. Also, the polyline must consist of only segments parallel to the coordinate axes. You are to find the minimum number of segments this polyline may consist of.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach of the three lines of the input contains two integers. The i-th line contains integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 10^9 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of segments of the polyline.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 -1\n1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n-1 -1\n-1 3\n4 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 1\n2 3\n3 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe variant of the polyline in the first sample: [Image] The variant of the polyline in the second sample: $1$ The variant of the polyline in the third sample: $\\because$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
