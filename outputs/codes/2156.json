We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs $(a_{2i+1}, a_{2i+2})$ with $(a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2})\\bmod 10$ for $0\\le i<2^{k-1}$. For every $i$ where $a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2}\\ge 10$ we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length $2^{k-1}$.\n\nLess formally, we partition sequence of length $2^k$ into $2^{k-1}$ pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth $\\ldots$, the last pair consists of the ($2^k-1$)-th and ($2^k$)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least $10$, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by $10$ (and don't change the order of the numbers).\n\nPerform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length $1$. Let $f([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}])$ denote the number of candies we get in this process. \n\nFor example: if the starting sequence is $[8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]$ then:\n\nAfter the first operation the sequence becomes $[(8 + 7)\\bmod 10, (3 + 1)\\bmod 10, (7 + 0)\\bmod 10, (9 + 4)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[5, 4, 7, 3]$, and we get $2$ candies as $8 + 7 \\ge 10$ and $9 + 4 \\ge 10$.\n\nAfter the second operation the sequence becomes $[(5 + 4)\\bmod 10, (7 + 3)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9, 0]$, and we get one more candy as $7 + 3 \\ge 10$. \n\nAfter the final operation sequence becomes $[(9 + 0) \\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9]$. \n\nTherefore, $f([8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]) = 3$ as we got $3$ candies in total.\n\nYou are given a sequence of digits of length $n$ $s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_n$. You have to answer $q$ queries of the form $(l_i, r_i)$, where for $i$-th query you have to output $f([s_{l_i}, s_{l_i+1}, \\ldots, s_{r_i}])$. It is guaranteed that $r_i-l_i+1$ is of form $2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ digits $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ ($0 \\le s_i \\le 9$).\n\nThe third line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $l_i$, $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 $i$-th query. It is guaranteed that $r_i-l_i+1$ is a nonnegative integer power of $2$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $q$ lines, in $i$-th line output single integer\u00a0\u2014 $f([s_{l_i}, s_{l_i + 1}, \\ldots, s_{r_i}])$, answer to the $i$-th query.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8\n8 7 3 1 7 0 9 4\n3\n1 8\n2 5\n7 7\n\nOutput\n3\n1\n0\n\nInput\n6\n0 1 2 3 3 5\n3\n1 2\n1 4\n3 6\n\nOutput\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example illustrates an example from the statement.\n\n$f([7, 3, 1, 7]) = 1$: sequence of operations is $[7, 3, 1, 7] \\to [(7 + 3)\\bmod 10, (1 + 7)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[0, 8]$ and one candy as $7 + 3 \\ge 10$ $\\to$ $[(0 + 8) \\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[8]$, so we get only $1$ candy.\n\n$f([9]) = 0$ as we don't perform operations with it.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
