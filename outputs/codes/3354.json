However, her partner is not as keen on filling a sandwich with pickles. Maj would like to maximize the amount of pickles on a sandwich, while still avoiding being judged by her partner. \n\nBoth Maj\u2019s sandwich and the pickles have a circular shape. The sandwich has radius $s$ cm and the pickles have radius $r$ cm.\n\nMaj has exactly $n$ pickles. She wants to place as many of them as possible on her sandwich, as long as:\n - at most $z \\% $ of the area of the sandwich is covered by pickles.\n - no two pickles overlap (but they are allowed to touch).\n\nHow many pickles can Maj place on her sandwich?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of:\n - one line with the decimal numbers $s$ and $r$ ($1 \\le s \\le 10$, $0.5 \\le r \\le s$, at most $6$ digits after the decimal point), the radius of the sandwich and the radius of a pickle, in centimetres.\n - one line with the integers $n$ and $z$ ($1 \\le n \\le 7$, $0 \\le z \\le 100$), the number of pickles Maj have, and the maximum area she may cover with them, in percent.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum number of pickles Maj can place on her sandwich. The input will always be constructed such that this number does not change if the radius of the sandwich increases or decreases by $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 1 4 40\nSample Output:\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
