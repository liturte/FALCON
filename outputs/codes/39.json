For example, the strings \"kek\", \"abacaba\", \"r\" and \"papicipap\" are palindromes, while the strings \"abb\" and \"iq\" are not.\n\nA substring $s[l \\ldots r]$ ($1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \\ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \\ldots s_{r}$.\n\nAnna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.\n\nSome time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.\n\nNote that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nmew\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\nwuffuw\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\nqqqqqqqq\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\n\"mew\" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string \"mew\" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.\n\nThe string \"uffuw\" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string \"wuffuw\", so the answer for the second example is $5$.\n\nAll substrings of the string \"qqqqqqqq\" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
