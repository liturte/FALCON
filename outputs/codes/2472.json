Kizahashi has N jobs numbered 1 to N.\nIt takes A_i units of time for Kizahashi to complete Job i. The deadline for Job i is time B_i, and he must complete the job before or at this time.\nKizahashi cannot work on two or more jobs simultaneously, but when he completes a job, he can start working on another immediately.\nCan Kizahashi complete all the jobs in time? If he can, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 10^9 (1 \\leq i \\leq N)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 B_1\n.\n.\n.\nA_N B_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Kizahashi can complete all the jobs in time, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n5\n2 4\n1 9\n1 8\n4 9\n3 12\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\n\nHe can complete all the jobs in time by, for example, doing them in the following order:\n - Do Job 2 from time 0 to 1.\n - Do Job 1 from time 1 to 3.\n - Do Job 4 from time 3 to 7.\n - Do Job 3 from time 7 to 8.\n - Do Job 5 from time 8 to 11.\nNote that it is fine to complete Job 3 exactly at the deadline, time 8.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
