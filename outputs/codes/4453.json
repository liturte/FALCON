At the end of any day, the $i$-th kid will give his book to the $p_i$-th kid (in case of $i = p_i$ the kid will give his book to himself). It is guaranteed that all values of $p_i$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ (i.e. $p$ is a permutation). The sequence $p$ doesn't change from day to day, it is fixed.\n\nFor example, if $n=6$ and $p=[4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2]$ then at the end of the first day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $4$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $6$-th kid and so on. At the end of the second day the book of the $1$-st kid will belong to the $3$-th kid, the $2$-nd kid will belong to the $2$-th kid and so on.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time for every $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nConsider the following example: $p = [5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$. The book of the $1$-st kid will be passed to the following kids:  after the $1$-st day it will belong to the $5$-th kid,  after the $2$-nd day it will belong to the $3$-rd kid,  after the $3$-rd day it will belong to the $2$-nd kid,  after the $4$-th day it will belong to the $1$-st kid. \n\nSo after the fourth day, the book of the first kid will return to its owner. The book of the fourth kid will return to him for the first time after exactly one day.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.\n\nThe first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of kids in the query. The second line of the query contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct, i.e. $p$ is a permutation), where $p_i$ is the kid which will get the book of the $i$-th kid.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query, print the answer on it: $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of the day the book of the $i$-th child is returned back to him for the first time in this query.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n2 3 1\n6\n4 6 2 1 5 3\n1\n1\n4\n3 4 1 2\n5\n5 1 2 4 3\n\nOutput\n1 1 1 1 1 \n3 3 3 \n2 3 3 2 1 3 \n1 \n2 2 2 2 \n4 4 4 1 4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
