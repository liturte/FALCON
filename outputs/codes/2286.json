The difference is constraints on the number of wise men and the time limit. You can make hacks only if all versions of this task are solved.\n\n$n$ wise men live in a beautiful city. Some of them know each other.\n\nFor each of the $n!$ possible permutations $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ of the wise men, let's generate a binary string of length $n-1$: for each $1 \\leq i < n$ set $s_i=1$ if $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ know each other, and $s_i=0$ otherwise. \n\nFor all possible $2^{n-1}$ binary strings, find the number of permutations that produce this binary string.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 14)$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of wise men in the city.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain a binary string of length $n$ each, such that the $j$-th character of the $i$-th string is equal to '1' if wise man $i$ knows wise man $j$, and equals '0' otherwise.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if the $i$-th man knows the $j$-th man, then the $j$-th man knows $i$-th man and no man knows himself.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $2^{n-1}$ space-separated integers. For each $0 \\leq x < 2^{n-1}$:\n\n  Let's consider a string $s$ of length $n-1$, such that $s_i = \\lfloor \\frac{x}{2^{i-1}} \\rfloor \\bmod 2$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$.  The $(x+1)$-th number should be equal to the required answer for $s$. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n011\n101\n110\n\nOutput\n0 0 0 6 \n\nInput\n4\n0101\n1000\n0001\n1010\n\nOutput\n2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, each wise man knows each other, so every permutation will produce the string $11$.\n\nIn the second test:\n\n  If $p = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the produced string is $101$, because wise men $1$ and $2$ know each other, $2$ and $3$ don't know each other, and $3$ and $4$ know each other;  If $p = \\{4, 1, 2, 3\\}$, the produced string is $110$, because wise men $1$ and $4$ know each other, $1$ and $2$ know each other and $2$, and $3$ don't know each other;  If $p = \\{1, 3, 2, 4\\}$, the produced string is $000$, because wise men $1$ and $3$ don't know each other, $3$ and $2$ don't know each other, and $2$ and $4$ don't know each other.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
