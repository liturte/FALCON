To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type:   take two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $2 \\cdot |i - j| \\geq n$ and swap $p_i$ and $p_j$. \n\nThere is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than $5 \\cdot n$ operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $n$ is even)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the permutation. \n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the given permutation.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the first line print $m$ ($0 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot n$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of swaps to perform.\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines should contain integers $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$, $|a_i - b_i| \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$)\u00a0\u2014 the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.\n\nNote that there is no need to minimize the number of operations.

After swapping elements on positions $2$ and $5$ the array becomes $[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]$ and finally after swapping elements on positions $1$ and $4$ the array becomes sorted: $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
