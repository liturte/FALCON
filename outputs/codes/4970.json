How many frosh will win the prize?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input begins with an integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 10000$, the number of frosh. For each frosh, a line follows containing the course numbers of five distinct courses selected by the frosh. Each course number is an integer between $100$ and $499$.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe popularity of a combination is the number of frosh selecting exactly the same combination of courses. A combination of courses is considered most popular if no other combination has higher popularity. Output a single line giving the total number of students taking some combination of courses that is most popular.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n100 101 102 103 488\n100 200 300 101 102\n103 102 101 488 100\nSample Output:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
