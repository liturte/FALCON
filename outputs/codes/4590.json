Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.\nIt takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \\leq i \\leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \\leq i \\leq M).\nConsider the following action:\n - Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.\nHow many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N, M \\leq 200000\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 10^9\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M K\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N\nB_1 B_2 \\ldots B_M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint an integer representing the maximum number of books that can be read.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 4 240\n60 90 120\n80 150 80 150\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n\nIn this case, it takes us 60, 90, 120 minutes to read the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd books from the top on Desk A, and 80, 150, 80, 150 minutes to read the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th books from the top on Desk B, respectively.\nWe can read three books in 230 minutes, as shown below, and this is the maximum number of books we can read within 240 minutes.\n - Read the topmost book on Desk A in 60 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.\n - Read the topmost book on Desk B in 80 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.\n - Read the topmost book on Desk A in 90 minutes, and remove that book from the desk.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
