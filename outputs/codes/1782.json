The secret needs dividing between k Keepers (let's index them by positive integers from 1 to k), the i-th Keeper gets a non-empty set of words with numbers from the set U_{i} = (u_{i}, 1, u_{i}, 2, ..., u_{i}, |U_{i}|). Here and below we'll presuppose that the set elements are written in the increasing order.\n\nWe'll say that the secret is safe if the following conditions are hold:  for any two indexes i, j (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 k) the intersection of sets U_{i} and U_{j} is an empty set;  the union of sets U_1, U_2, ..., U_{k} is set (1, 2, ..., n);  in each set U_{i}, its elements u_{i}, 1, u_{i}, 2, ..., u_{i}, |U_{i}| do not form an arithmetic progression (in particular, |U_{i}| \u2265 3 should hold). \n\nLet us remind you that the elements of set (u_1, u_2, ..., u_{s}) form an arithmetic progression if there is such number d, that for all i (1 \u2264 i < s) fulfills u_{i} + d = u_{i} + 1. For example, the elements of sets (5), (1, 10) and (1, 5, 9) form arithmetic progressions and the elements of sets (1, 2, 4) and (3, 6, 8) don't.\n\nYour task is to find any partition of the set of words into subsets U_1, U_2, ..., U_{k} so that the secret is safe. Otherwise indicate that there's no such partition.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of a single line which contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of words in the secret and the number of the Keepers. The numbers are separated by a single space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no way to keep the secret safe, print a single integer \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print n integers, the i-th of them representing the number of the Keeper who's got the i-th word of the secret.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11 3\n\nOutput\n3 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 3 1\n\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
