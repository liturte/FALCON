Of course, she makes her living by predicting others' future. While doing divination, Kaavi believes that magic spells can provide great power for her to see the future. [Image]\u00a0\n\nKaavi has a string $T$ of length $m$ and all the strings with the prefix $T$ are magic spells. Kaavi also has a string $S$ of length $n$ and an empty string $A$.\n\nDuring the divination, Kaavi needs to perform a sequence of operations. There are two different operations: Delete the first character of $S$ and add it at the front of $A$. Delete the first character of $S$ and add it at the back of $A$.\n\nKaavi can perform no more than $n$ operations. To finish the divination, she wants to know the number of different operation sequences to make $A$ a magic spell (i.e. with the prefix $T$). As her assistant, can you help her? The answer might be huge, so Kaavi only needs to know the answer modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\nTwo operation sequences are considered different if they are different in length or there exists an $i$ that their $i$-th operation is different. \n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. A prefix of a string $S$ is a substring of $S$ that occurs at the beginning of $S$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a string $S$ of length $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 3000$).\n\nThe second line contains a string $T$ of length $m$ ($1 \\leq m \\leq n$).\n\nBoth strings contain only lowercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe output contains only one integer \u00a0\u2014 the answer modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nabab\nba\n\nOutput\n12\nInput\ndefineintlonglong\nsignedmain\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\nrotator\nrotator\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\ncacdcdbbbb\nbdcaccdbbb\n\nOutput\n24\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test:\n\n$\\text{baba abab bbaa baab baab}$\n\nThe red ones are the magic spells. In the first operation, Kaavi can either add the first character \"a\" at the front or the back of $A$, although the results are the same, they are considered as different operations. So the answer is $6\\times2=12$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
