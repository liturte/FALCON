Yes, free food. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the event involves a long (sometimes boring) seminar. As long as free food is served for the event, then students will surely come.\n\nSuppose there are $N$ events to be held this year. The $i^\\textrm {th}$ event is scheduled from day $s_ i$ to day $t_ i$, and free food is served for that event every day from day $s_ i$ to day $t_ i$ (inclusive). Your task in this problem is to find out how many days there are in which free food is served by at least one event.\n\nFor example, let there be $N = 3$ events. The first event is held from day $10$ to $14$, the second event is held from day $13$ to $17$, and the third event is held from day $25$ to $26$. The days in which free food is served by at least one event are $10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26$, for a total of $10$ days. Note that both events serve free food on days $13$ and $14$.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100$) denoting the number of events. Each of the next $N$ lines contains two integers $s_ i$ and $t_ i$ ($1 \\le s_ i \\le t_ i \\le 365$) denoting that the $i^\\textrm {th}$ event will be held from $s_ i$ to $t_ i$ (inclusive), and free food is served for all of those days.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output contains an integer denoting the number of days in which free food is served by at least one event.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n10 14\n13 17\n25 26\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n1 365\n20 28\nSample Output 2:\n365\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
