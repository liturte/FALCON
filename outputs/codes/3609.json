One of the trees grew from the left, and the other from the right. On $n$ points, they collided.\n\nNumbering the points $1, 2, \\dots , n$ from left to right, the left tree ended up connecting all of them in a single subtree rooted in node $1$, such that every node\u2019s children had larger numbers than the node itself. We can describe this subtree with a list of $n-1$ edges.\n\nSimilarly, the right tree also connected all nodes in a single subtree rooted in node $n$, with every node\u2019s children having smaller numbers than the node itself. This yields an additional $n-1$ edges.\n\nNow, given the full list of $2(n-1)$ edges, it is not necessarily easy to tell which edge belongs to which tree. Can you figure out a possible assignment, or determine that it is impossible for this collection to have been the union of two trees?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$). The next $2(n-1)$ lines each contain two integers $u, v$ ($1 \\le u < v \\le n$) indicating an edge joining the two nodes $u$ and $v$. A pair $(u, v)$ may be connected by more than one edge.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible for the edges to be the union of two trees that grow left-to-right and right-to-left, output a string of length $2(n-1)$, where the $i$\u2019s character is L if the $i$\u2019th edge should come from the left tree, or R if it should come from the right tree. Otherwise, output the word \u201cimpossible\u201d on a single line. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Inputs-----\nIn the first example, there are two solutions: LLRRRRLL and LLRLRRLR.\n\nIn the second example, there are no solutions. Note that LRLR is not valid, because it would involve the right tree growing backward, from left to right.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5\n1 2\n2 5\n2 3\n1 3\n3 5\n4 5\n3 4\n1 3\nSample Output:\nLLRRRRLL\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
