It will light all the squares on the way, including the square on which the lamp is placed, but not the square occupied by an obstacle.\nSnuke wants to maximize the number of squares lighted by the lamp.\nYou are given H strings S_i (1 \\leq i \\leq H), each of length W. If the j-th character (1 \\leq j \\leq W) of S_i is #, there is an obstacle on the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left; if that character is ., there is no obstacle on that square.\nFind the maximum possible number of squares lighted by the lamp.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq H \\leq 2,000\n - 1 \\leq W \\leq 2,000\n - S_i is a string of length W consisting of # and ..\n - . occurs at least once in one of the strings S_i (1 \\leq i \\leq H).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nS_1\n:\nS_H\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum possible number of squares lighted by the lamp.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 6\n#..#..\n.....#\n....#.\n#.#...\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n8\n\nIf Snuke places the lamp on the square at the second row from the top and the second column from the left, it will light the following squares: the first through fifth squares from the left in the second row, and the first through fourth squares from the top in the second column, for a total of eight squares.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
