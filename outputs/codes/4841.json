His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud. \n\nUnfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild\u2019s counting makes sense or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains $n$ space-separated words spoken by Arild, the $i$\u2019th of which is either a non-negative integer $a_ i$ ($0 \\le a_ i \\le 10000$) or the string \u201cmumble\u201d.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Arild\u2019s counting might make sense, print the string \u201cmakes sense\u201d. Otherwise, print the string \u201csomething is fishy\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n1 2 3 mumble 5\nSample Output 1:\nmakes sense\n\nSample Input 2:\n8\n1 2 3 mumble mumble 7 mumble 8\nSample Output 2:\nsomething is fishy\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
