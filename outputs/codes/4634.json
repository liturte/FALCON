The $i$-th position of bookshelf is $a_i = 1$ if there is a book on this position and $a_i = 0$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.\n\nIn one move, you can choose some contiguous segment $[l; r]$ consisting of books (i.e. for each $i$ from $l$ to $r$ the condition $a_i = 1$ holds) and:  Shift it to the right by $1$: move the book at index $i$ to $i + 1$ for all $l \\le i \\le r$. This move can be done only if $r+1 \\le n$ and there is no book at the position $r+1$.  Shift it to the left by $1$: move the book at index $i$ to $i-1$ for all $l \\le i \\le r$. This move can be done only if $l-1 \\ge 1$ and there is no book at the position $l-1$. \n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).\n\nFor example, for $a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]$ there is a gap between books ($a_4 = 0$ when $a_3 = 1$ and $a_5 = 1$), for $a = [1, 1, 0]$ there are no gaps between books and for $a = [0, 0,0]$ there are also no gaps between books.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 200$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$) \u2014 the number of places on a bookshelf. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$), where $a_i$ is $1$ if there is a book at this position and $0$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without gaps).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n7\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n3\n1 0 0\n5\n1 1 0 0 1\n6\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n5\n1 1 0 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n0\n2\n4\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[3; 3]$ to the right and the segment $[4; 5]$ to the right. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[5; 7]$. So the answer is $2$.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, you have nothing to do, all the books on the bookshelf form the contiguous segment already.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[5; 5]$ to the left and then the segment $[4; 4]$ to the left again. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[1; 3]$. So the answer is $2$.\n\nIn the fourth test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[1; 1]$ to the right, the segment $[2; 2]$ to the right, the segment $[6; 6]$ to the left and then the segment $[5; 5]$ to the left. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[3; 4]$. So the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the fifth test case of the example, you can shift the segment $[1; 2]$ to the right. After all moves, the books form the contiguous segment $[2; 5]$. So the answer is $1$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
