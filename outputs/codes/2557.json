There are n cities in the kingdom, numbered from 1 to n.\n\nThanks to Mr. Kitayuta's research, it has finally become possible to construct teleportation pipes between two cities. A teleportation pipe will connect two cities unidirectionally, that is, a teleportation pipe from city x to city y cannot be used to travel from city y to city x. The transportation within each city is extremely developed, therefore if a pipe from city x to city y and a pipe from city y to city z are both constructed, people will be able to travel from city x to city z instantly.\n\nMr. Kitayuta is also involved in national politics. He considers that the transportation between the m pairs of city (a_{i}, b_{i}) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) is important. He is planning to construct teleportation pipes so that for each important pair (a_{i}, b_{i}), it will be possible to travel from city a_{i} to city b_{i} by using one or more teleportation pipes (but not necessarily from city b_{i} to city a_{i}). Find the minimum number of teleportation pipes that need to be constructed. So far, no teleportation pipe has been constructed, and there is no other effective transportation between cities.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5), denoting the number of the cities in Shuseki Kingdom and the number of the important pairs, respectively.\n\nThe following m lines describe the important pairs. The i-th of them (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n, a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}), denoting that it must be possible to travel from city a_{i} to city b_{i} by using one or more teleportation pipes (but not necessarily from city b_{i} to city a_{i}). It is guaranteed that all pairs (a_{i}, b_{i}) are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum required number of teleportation pipes to fulfill Mr. Kitayuta's purpose.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4 6\n1 2\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 2\n3 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, one of the optimal ways to construct pipes is shown in the image below:  [Image] \n\nFor the second sample, one of the optimal ways is shown below:  [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
