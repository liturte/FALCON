Each of the $n - 1$ edges of the tree is colored in either black or red.\n\nYou are also given an integer $k$. Consider sequences of $k$ vertices. Let's call a sequence $[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k]$ good if it satisfies the following criterion:  We will walk a path (possibly visiting same edge/vertex multiple times) on the tree, starting from $a_1$ and ending at $a_k$.  Start at $a_1$, then go to $a_2$ using the shortest path between $a_1$ and $a_2$, then go to $a_3$ in a similar way, and so on, until you travel the shortest path between $a_{k-1}$ and $a_k$. If you walked over at least one black edge during this process, then the sequence is good.  [Image] \n\nConsider the tree on the picture. If $k=3$ then the following sequences are good: $[1, 4, 7]$, $[5, 5, 3]$ and $[2, 3, 7]$. The following sequences are not good: $[1, 4, 6]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[3, 7, 3]$.\n\nThere are $n^k$ sequences of vertices, count how many of them are good. Since this number can be quite large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le k \\le 100$), the size of the tree and the length of the vertex sequence.\n\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$), where $u_i$ and $v_i$ denote the endpoints of the corresponding edge and $x_i$ is the color of this edge ($0$ denotes red edge and $1$ denotes black edge).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of good sequences modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 4\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n\nOutput\n252\nInput\n4 6\n1 2 0\n1 3 0\n1 4 0\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n3 5\n1 2 1\n2 3 0\n\nOutput\n210\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, all sequences ($4^4$) of length $4$ except the following are good:   $[1, 1, 1, 1]$ $[2, 2, 2, 2]$ $[3, 3, 3, 3]$ $[4, 4, 4, 4]$ \n\nIn the second example, all edges are red, hence there aren't any good sequences.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
