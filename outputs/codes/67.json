Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.\n\nThere are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be \"+\"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be \"-\"; otherwise the result will be \"0\".\n\nBecause of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.\n\nTell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\\le x,y,z\\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is only one possible result, print the result : \"+\", \"-\" or \"0\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"?\" to report that the result is uncertain.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 7 0\n\nOutput\n-\nInput\n2 0 1\n\nOutput\n+\nInput\n1 1 0\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n0 0 1\n\nOutput\n?\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is \"-\".\n\nIn the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is \"+\".\n\nIn the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is \"0\".\n\nIn the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be \"+\", otherwise, the result would be \"-\". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
