After an eventful evening that will be remembered for a record number of solved tasks from the field of electronics, Dominik went home. To his surprise, the police stopped him thinking he was drunk. It is known that in these situations sobriety is proven by solving a series of carefully crafted tasks that test a man\u2019s cognitive abilities. If we can trust Dominik, the conversation went something like this:Policeman\n\nSomething easy to begin with\u2026\u00a0What is the complexity of bubble sort?Dominik\n\nThat is really easy, $\\mathrm{O}(n^2)$.Policeman\n\nSay the English alphabet in reverse.Dominik\n\nTrivial, zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.Policeman\n\nYou learned that by heart. Now imagine that all the letters of the English alphabet from \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018z\u2019 are respectively written clockwise in a circle. Begin with the letter \u2018a\u2019 and say the letters clockwise. After each spoken letter, I can tell you to continue saying the alphabet in reverse order or I can ask you how many times so far you\u2019ve said a certain letter. Are you ready? 3, 2, 1, Go!Dominik\n\nUm\u2026\u00a0a, b, c\u2026\n\nWrite a programme that solves Dominik\u2019s problem.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $Q$ ($1 \\leq Q \\leq 100000$), the number of policeman\u2019s orders. Each of the following $Q$ lines contains one of the policeman\u2019s order in the form of \u201cSMJER $n$\u201d (Croatian for direction) or \u201cUPIT$n$ $x$\u201d (Croatian for query). The order in the form \u201cSMJER $n$\u201d means that, after the nth spoken letter, Dominik must start saying the alphabet in reverse, whereas the order in the form \u201cUPIT$n$ $x$\u201d means that Dominik must say how many times so far he\u2019s said the letter $x$ in the first $n$ spoken letters.\n\nThe policeman\u2019s order will be given chronologically in the input, or, the numbers $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9 $) from the orders will be strictly ascending. The character $x$ from the order in the form of \u201cUPIT $n$ $x$\u201d is a lowercase letter of the English alphabet.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each order in the form of \u201cUPIT $n$$x$\u201d, output how many times Dominik has said the letter $x$ in the first $n$ spoken letters. The answer to each query needs to be written in a separate line, and the queries need to be answered in the order given in the input.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\nUPIT 1 b\nUPIT 3 b\nSMJER 4\nUPIT 7 a\nUPIT 10 z\nSample Output 1:\n0\n1\n2\n1\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\nSMJER 1\nSMJER 2\nSMJER 3\nUPIT 5 a\nUPIT 7 w\nSample Output 2:\n2\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
