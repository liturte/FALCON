The version we\u2019ll be dealing with comes from the late 1800\u2019s and works as follows. The message to be encoded is written on an $n \\times n$ grid row-wise, top to bottom, and is overlaid with a card with a set of holes punched out of it (this is the grille).\n\nThe message is encrypted by writing down the letters that appear in the holes, row by row, then rotating the grille 90 degrees clockwise, writing the new letters that appear, and repeating this process two more times. Of course the holes in the grille must be chosen so that every letter in the message will eventually appear in a hole (this is actually not that hard to arrange).\n\nAn example is shown below, where the message \u201cSend more monkeys\u201d is encrypted as \u201cnoeesrksdmnyemoj\u201d, after adding a random letter to fill out the grid (this example corresponds to the first sample input.)\n\n Figure I.1 \n\nIf the message is larger than the $n \\times n$ grid, then the first $n^2$ letters are written in the grid and encrypted, then the next $n^2$ are encrypted, and so on, always filling the last grid with random letters if needed. Here, we will only be dealing with messages of length $n^2$.\n\nYour job, should you choose to accept it, is to take an encrypted message and the corresponding grille and decrypt it. And we\u2019ll add one additional twist: the grille given might be invalid, i.e., the holes used do not allow every location in the grid to be used during the encryption process. If this is the case, then you must indicate that you can\u2019t decrypt the message.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line containing a positive integer $n\\le 10$ indicating the size of the grid and grille. The next $n$ lines will specify the grille, using \u2018.\u2019 for a hole and \u2018X\u2019 for a non-hole. Following this will be a line containing the encrypted message, consisting solely of lowercase alphabetic characters. The number of characters in this line will always be $n^2$.\n\n\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the decrypted text as a single string with no spaces, or the phrase \u201cinvalid grille\u201d if the grille is invalid.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\nXX.X\nX.X.\nXXXX\n.XXX\nnoeesrksdmnyemoj\nSample Output 1:\nsendmoremonkeysj\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\n.XX.\nXXXX\nXXXX\n.XX.\nabcdefghijklmnop\nSample Output 2:\ninvalid grille\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
