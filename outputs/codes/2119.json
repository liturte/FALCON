Let's define a partition of $x$ such a sequence of strings $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$ that $s_1 + s_2 + \\dots + s_k = x$, where $+$ is a concatanation of strings. $s_i$ is the $i$-th element of the partition. For example, number $12345$ has the following partitions: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"], [\"123\", \"4\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"2345\"], [\"12345\"] and lots of others.\n\nLet's call some partition of $a$ beautiful if each of its elements contains no leading zeros.\n\nVasya want to know the number of beautiful partitions of number $a$, which has each of $s_i$ satisfy the condition $l \\le s_i \\le r$. Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.\n\nHelp Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number $a$ such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $a~(1 \\le a \\le 10^{1000000})$.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer $l~(0 \\le l \\le 10^{1000000})$.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer $r~(0 \\le r \\le 10^{1000000})$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $l \\le r$.\n\nIt is also guaranteed that numbers $a, l, r$ contain no leading zeros.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the amount of partitions of number $a$ such that they match all the given requirements modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n135\n1\n15\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n10000\n0\n9\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there are two good partitions $13+5$ and $1+3+5$.\n\nIn the second test case, there is one good partition $1+0+0+0+0$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
