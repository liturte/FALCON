Bomb i is planted at the coordinate A_i. It is currently activated if B_i=1, and deactivated if B_i=0.\nThe device has M cords numbered 1 to M. If we cut Cord j, the states of all the bombs planted between the coordinates L_j and R_j (inclusive) will be switched - from activated to deactivated, and vice versa.\nDetermine whether it is possible to deactivate all the bombs at the same time. If the answer is yes, output a set of cords that should be cut.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\\ (1 \\leq i \\leq N)\n - A_i are pairwise distinct.\n - B_i is 0 or 1.
