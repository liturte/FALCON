It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.\n\nYour task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label $1$ on it) is equal to $D$ (or say that there are no such spanning trees). Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $D$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \\le m \\le min(2 \\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}), 1 \\le D < n$) \u2014 the number of vertices, the number of edges and required degree of the first vertex, respectively.\n\nThe following $m$ lines denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$, $u_i \\ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \\ne u_i$ is satisfied.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition from the problem statement, print \"NO\" in the first line.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" in the first line and then print $n-1$ lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label $1$ on it) is equal to $D$. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge $(v, u)$ is considered the same as the edge $(u, v)$).\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\nYES\n2 1\n2 3\n3 4\n\nInput\n4 5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2\n1 3\n4 1\n\nInput\n4 4 3\n1 2\n1 4\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe picture corresponding to the first and second examples: [Image]\n\nThe picture corresponding to the third example: [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
