Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for $n$ flowers and so it looks like a pipe with $n$ holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.\n\nArkady can block some of the holes, and then pour $A$ liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is $S$, and the $i$-th hole is not blocked, $\\frac{s_i \\cdot A}{S}$ liters of water will flow out of it.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least $B$ liters of water flow out of the first hole?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $A$, $B$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $1 \\le B \\le A \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ ($1 \\le s_i \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the sizes of the holes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of holes Arkady should block.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 10 3\n2 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 80 20\n3 2 1 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n5 10 10\n1000 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Arkady should block at least one hole. After that, $\\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{6} \\approx 3.333$ liters of water will flow out of the first hole, and that suits Arkady.\n\nIn the second example even without blocking any hole, $\\frac{80 \\cdot 3}{10} = 24$ liters will flow out of the first hole, that is not less than $20$.\n\nIn the third example Arkady has to block all holes except the first to make all water flow out of the first hole.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
