And not even the single one but two at the same time! \n\nAlice has a sheet with n notes written on it. She wants to take two such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.\n\nSubsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nSubsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differs by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.\n\nYou should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5000).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5) \u2014 notes written on a sheet.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 4 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n6\n62 22 60 61 48 49\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example subsequences [1, 2] and [4, 5] give length 4 in total.\n\nIn the second example subsequences [62, 48, 49] and [60, 61] give length 5 in total. If you choose subsequence [62, 61] in the first place then the second melody will have maximum length 2, that gives the result of 4, which is not maximal.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
