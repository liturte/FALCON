The extent to which one word rhymes with another depends on how similar they sound; but if they are too similar then they aren\u2019t considered a rhyme at all. Karim has a huge list of $N$ words and wants to determine the maximally rhyming pair of words. To that end he has introduced the concept of rhyme power:\n\nGiven two words $S$ and $T$, their rhyme power $r(S,T)$ is defined as\n - $0$, if one word is a suffix of the other,\n - the length of their longest common suffix, otherwise.\n\nFor instance, the rhyme power of \u201cfire\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d is $3$, because their longest common suffix \u201cire\u201d has length $3$. In contrast, the rhyme power of \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d is $0$, because \u201cpossible\u201d is a suffix of \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\nGiven Karim\u2019s list of $N$ words, your task is to find the maximum value of $r(S, T)$ over all pairs of words.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ with $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$, the number of words.\n\nThe following $N$ lines each contain a string $S_ i$, where $1 \\leq |S_ i| \\leq 10^6$. The sum of all string lengths $|S_ i|$ is at most $10^6$.\n\n-----Output-----\nAn integer, the maximal rhyme power.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\nspaghetti\nalready\nconfetti\nserengeti\nSample Output:\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
