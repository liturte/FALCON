And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $a$, the second in position $b$. Positions are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nSince they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $p$ and $s$ respectively, then distance between them is $|p - s|$. \n\nYou can do the following operation at most $x$ times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students and swap them.\n\nCalculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $x$ swaps.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $x$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$, $0 \\le x \\le 100$, $1 \\le a, b \\le n$, $a \\neq b$) \u2014 the number of students in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling students respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the maximum distance between two rivaling students which you can obtain.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5 1 3 2\n100 33 100 1\n6 0 2 3\n\nOutput\n2\n99\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case you can swap students in positions $3$ and $4$. And then the distance between the rivals is equal to $|4 - 2| = 2$.\n\nIn the second test case you don't have to swap students. \n\nIn the third test case you can't swap students.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
