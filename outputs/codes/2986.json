In that problem, every time we see a character \u2018<\u2019, it actually means that the \u2018Backspace\u2019 key is pressed and we undo the last character that was just typed.\n\n\nThe extension is as follows: Now, pressing a \u2018<\u2019 (the \u2018Backspace\u2019 key) when the (typing) cursor is at the front of the line does nothing. Now if we see a character \u2018[\u2019, it actually means that the \u2018Home\u2019 key is pressed and we move the (typing) cursor to the front of the line. Similarly, if we see a character \u2018]\u2019, it actually means that the \u2018End\u2019 key is pressed and we move the (typing) cursor the back of the line. For all other valid character in the input, it actually means that the corresponding key is pressed, we insert that character at the (typing) cursor position, and advance one position to the right the cursor accordingly.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input starts with a line containing just one integer $T \\: (1 \\le T \\le 10)$, denoting the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case is a line containing the string that was written in the Text Editor Sim (Steven IMproved). The length of the string is at most $10^{6}$, and it will only contain lowercase letters from the English alphabet [\u2018$a$\u2019$\\; \\ldots \\; $\u2018$z$\u2019], digits [\u2018$0$\u2019$\\; \\ldots \\; $\u2018$9$\u2019], spaces, as well as some of the three special characters: \u2018<\u2019, \u2018[\u2019, or \u2018]\u2019.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output one line containing the final string that is displayed on screen.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n - $\\textbf{(27.5 points)}$: $1 \\le T \\le 10$, string length is at most $10^{3}$, there is no \u2018[\u2019, as seen in sample $1$.\n - $\\textbf{(32.5 points)}$: $1 \\le T \\le 10$, string length is at most $10^{3}$, there may be \u2018[\u2019, as seen in sample $2$.\n - $\\textbf{(40 points)}$: $1 \\le T \\le 4$, string length is at most $10^{6}$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\nmy ]]name]] is]] steva<en]<n halim]]]]]\nSample Output:\nmy name is steven halim\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
