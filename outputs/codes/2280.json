On the first picture the lengths of planks are $[3, 3]$ for the base and $[1]$ for the step. On the second picture lengths are $[3, 3]$ for the base and $[2]$ for the step. On the third picture lengths are $[3, 4]$ for the base and $[2, 3]$ for the steps. \n\n $H - 1 =$ \n\nYou have $n$ planks. The length of the $i$-th planks is $a_i$. You don't have a saw, so you can't cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised \"ladder\" from the planks.\n\nThe question is: what is the maximum number $k$ such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a $k$-step ladder using them?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of queries. The queries are independent.\n\nEach query consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of planks you have.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the lengths of the corresponding planks.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total number of planks from all queries doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ integers \u2014 one per query. The $i$-th integer is the maximum number $k$, such that you can choose some subset of the planks given in the $i$-th query and assemble a $k$-step ladder using them.\n\nPrint $0$ if you can't make even $1$-step ladder from the given set of planks.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n1 3 1 3\n3\n3 3 2\n5\n2 3 3 4 2\n3\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n1\n2\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nExamples for the queries $1-3$ are shown at the image in the legend section.\n\nThe Russian meme to express the quality of the ladders:\n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
