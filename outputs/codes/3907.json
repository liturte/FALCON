But not everything is so easy, Sereja's friend Dima has m coupons, each contains two integers q_{i}, w_{i}. Coupon i costs w_{i} and allows you to use as many numbers q_{i} as you want when constructing the array a. Values q_{i} are distinct. Sereja has no coupons, so Dima and Sereja have made the following deal. Dima builds some beautiful array a of n elements. After that he takes w_{i} rubles from Sereja for each q_{i}, which occurs in the array a. Sereja believed his friend and agreed to the contract, and now he is wondering, what is the maximum amount of money he can pay.\n\nHelp Sereja, find the maximum amount of money he can pay to Dima.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^6, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). Next m lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains numbers q_{i}, w_{i} (1 \u2264 q_{i}, w_{i} \u2264 10^5).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all q_{i} are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print maximum amount of money (in rubles) Sereja can pay.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n1 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n100 3\n1 2\n2 1\n3 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1 2\n1 1\n2 100\n\nOutput\n100\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Sereja can pay 5 rubles, for example, if Dima constructs the following array: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. There are another optimal arrays for this test.\n\nIn the third sample Sereja can pay 100 rubles, if Dima constructs the following array: [2].\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
