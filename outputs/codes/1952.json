You prepared the problems: statements, solutions, checkers, validators, tests... Suddenly, your coordinator asks you to change all your tests to multiple testcases in the easiest problem!\n\nInitially, each test in that problem is just an array. The maximum size of an array is $k$. For simplicity, the contents of arrays don't matter. You have $n$ tests \u2014 the $i$-th test is an array of size $m_i$ ($1 \\le m_i \\le k$).\n\nYour coordinator asks you to distribute all of your arrays into multiple testcases. Each testcase can include multiple arrays. However, each testcase should include no more than $c_1$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $1$ ($\\ge 1$), no more than $c_2$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $2$, $\\dots$, no more than $c_k$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $k$. Also, $c_1 \\ge c_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge c_k$.\n\nSo now your goal is to create the new testcases in such a way that:   each of the initial arrays appears in exactly one testcase;  for each testcase the given conditions hold;  the number of testcases is minimum possible. \n\nPrint the minimum possible number of testcases you can achieve and the sizes of arrays included in each testcase.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of initial tests and the limit for the size of each array.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$ ($1 \\le m_i \\le k$)\u00a0\u2014 the sizes of the arrays in the original tests.\n\nThe third line contains $k$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$ ($n \\ge c_1 \\ge c_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge c_k \\ge 1$); $c_i$ is the maximum number of arrays of size greater than or equal to $i$ you can have in a single testcase.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single integer $ans$ ($1 \\le ans \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of testcases you can achieve.\n\nEach of the next $ans$ lines should contain the description of a testcase in the following format:\n\n$t$ $a_1$ $a_2$ $\\dots$ $a_{t}$ ($1 \\le t\\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the testcase includes $t$ arrays, $a_i$ is the size of the $i$-th array in that testcase.\n\nEach of the initial arrays should appear in exactly one testcase. In particular, it implies that the sum of $t$ over all $ans$ testcases should be equal to $n$.\n\nNote that the answer always exists due to $c_k \\ge 1$ (and therefore $c_1 \\ge 1$).\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 2 2 3\n4 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n1 2\n2 1 3\n1 2\n\nInput\n6 10\n5 8 1 10 8 7\n6 6 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n3 8 5 7\n3 10 8 1\n\nInput\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n5\n\nOutput\n1\n5 1 1 1 1 1\n\nInput\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1\n\nOutput\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there is no way to distribute the tests into less than $3$ testcases. The given answer satisfies the conditions: each of the testcases includes no more than $4$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $1$ and no more than $1$ array of sizes greater than or equal to $2$ and $3$.\n\nNote that there are multiple valid answers for this test. For example, testcases with sizes $[[2], [1, 2], [3]]$ would also be correct.\n\nHowever, testcases with sizes $[[1, 2], [2, 3]]$ would be incorrect because there are $2$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $2$ in the second testcase.\n\nNote the difference between the third and the fourth examples. You can include up to $5$ arrays of size greater than or equal to $1$ in the third example, so you can put all arrays into a single testcase. And you can have only up to $1$ array in the fourth example. Thus, every array should be included in a separate testcase.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
