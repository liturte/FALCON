The graph had an interesting property: there were at most k edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume that the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to n.\n\nOne day Valera counted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other ones and wrote them out in array d. Thus, element d[i] of the array shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number i.\n\nThen something irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph. However, he still has the array d. Help him restore the lost graph.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k < n \u2264 10^5). Number n shows the number of vertices in the original graph. Number k shows that at most k edges were adjacent to each vertex in the original graph.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated integers d[1], d[2], ..., d[n] (0 \u2264 d[i] < n). Number d[i] shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to the vertex number i.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Valera made a mistake in his notes and the required graph doesn't exist, print in the first line number -1. Otherwise, in the first line print integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of edges in the found graph.\n\nIn each of the next m lines print two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n;\u00a0a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}), denoting the edge that connects vertices with numbers a_{i} and b_{i}. The graph shouldn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n0 1 1\n\nOutput\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n3 2\n\nInput\n4 2\n2 0 1 3\n\nOutput\n3\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n\nInput\n3 1\n0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
