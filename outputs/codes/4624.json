Vasya knows that Petya's apartment number is $n$. \n\nThere is only one entrance in Petya's house and the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains $2$ apartments, every other floor contains $x$ apartments each. Apartments are numbered starting from one, from the first floor. I.e. apartments on the first floor have numbers $1$ and $2$, apartments on the second floor have numbers from $3$ to $(x + 2)$, apartments on the third floor have numbers from $(x + 3)$ to $(2 \\cdot x + 2)$, and so on.\n\nYour task is to find the number of floor on which Petya lives. Assume that the house is always high enough to fit at least $n$ apartments.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n, x \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of Petya's apartment and the number of apartments on each floor of the house except the first one (there are two apartments on the first floor).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the number of floor on which Petya lives.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n7 3\n1 5\n22 5\n987 13\n\nOutput\n3\n1\n5\n77\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first test case of the example: the first floor contains apartments with numbers $1$ and $2$, the second one contains apartments with numbers $3$, $4$ and $5$, the third one contains apartments with numbers $6$, $7$ and $8$. Therefore, Petya lives on the third floor.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, Petya lives in the apartment $1$ which is on the first floor.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
