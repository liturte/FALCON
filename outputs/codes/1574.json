He is tired of dealing with crime by himself. He needs three brave warriors to help him to fight against bad guys.\n\nThere are n warriors. Richelimakieu wants to choose three of them to become musketeers but it's not that easy. The most important condition is that musketeers must know each other to cooperate efficiently. And they shouldn't be too well known because they could be betrayed by old friends. For each musketeer his recognition is the number of warriors he knows, excluding other two musketeers.\n\nHelp Richelimakieu! Find if it is possible to choose three musketeers knowing each other, and what is minimum possible sum of their recognitions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, n and m (3 \u2264 n \u2264 4000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 4000) \u2014 respectively number of warriors and number of pairs of warriors knowing each other.\n\ni-th of the following m lines contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n, a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}). Warriors a_{i} and b_{i} know each other. Each pair of warriors will be listed at most once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Richelimakieu can choose three musketeers, print the minimum possible sum of their recognitions. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n7 4\n2 1\n3 6\n5 1\n1 7\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Richelimakieu should choose a triple 1, 2, 3. The first musketeer doesn't know anyone except other two musketeers so his recognition is 0. The second musketeer has recognition 1 because he knows warrior number 4. The third musketeer also has recognition 1 because he knows warrior 4. Sum of recognitions is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThe other possible triple is 2, 3, 4 but it has greater sum of recognitions, equal to 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nIn the second sample there is no triple of warriors knowing each other.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
