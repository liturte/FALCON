Diablo enjoys having lots of space to move around, so Anthony wants to build him a cage that covers as much area as possible.\n\nHowever, Diablo also likes to dig and hide very much, and when he does, it is an absolute pain for Anthony to find Diablo (Diablo is very good at hiding). Therefore, Anthony wants to make sure the cage he builds for Diablo is not too big. In particular, Anthony wants to make sure the area of the cage is exactly $A$ square meters; any area larger than $A$ square meters will be too much work to find Diablo when he hides, any area smaller than $A$ square meters will be too uncomfortable for Diablo.\n\nAnthony has $N$ meters of fencing that can be cut/bent at any point, and wonders if it is possible to build a cage of any shape that has area exactly $A$ with the materials he has. Write a program to help him out!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains two real numbers $0<A\\leq 100$ and $0\\leq N\\leq 1000$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line with \u201cDiablo is happy!\u201d if Anthony can build his cage for Diablo, \u201cNeed more materials!\u201d otherwise.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1.000000 4.000000\nSample Output:\nDiablo is happy!\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
