You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.\n\nCan you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 min(n(n - 1), 100000)) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.\n\nThen m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 2\n3 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 2\n3 1\n2 1\n4 5\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can remove edge $2 \\rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.\n\nIn the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \\rightarrow 1$ and $2 \\rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
