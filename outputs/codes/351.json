Each problem is denoted by its difficulty \u2014 a positive integer number. Difficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with difficulty d on Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficulty d on any other judge). \n\nMakes has chosen n problems to solve on Decoforces with difficulties a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order. Though he can solve problem i with difficulty a_{i} only if he had already solved some problem with difficulty $d \\geq \\frac{a_{i}}{2}$ (no matter on what online judge was it).\n\nBefore starting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with maximum difficulty k.\n\nWith given conditions it's easy to see that Makes sometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he chooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving problems from his list. \n\nFor every positive integer y there exist some problem with difficulty y on at least one judge besides Decoforces.\n\nMakes can solve problems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the chosen list one right after another.\n\nMakes doesn't have too much free time, so he asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on other judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n2 1 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 20\n10 3 6 3\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3.\n\nIn the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
