You want to make $s$ equal to $t$. \n\nYou can perform the following operation on $s$ any number of times to achieve it\u00a0\u2014   Choose any substring of $s$ and rotate it clockwise once, that is, if the selected substring is $s[l,l+1...r]$, then it becomes $s[r,l,l + 1 ... r - 1]$. All the remaining characters of $s$ stay in their position. \n\nFor example, on rotating the substring $[2,4]$ , string \"abcde\" becomes \"adbce\". \n\nA string $a$ is a substring of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to convert $s$ to $t$, or determine that it's impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ $(1\\leq t \\leq 2000)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ $(1\\leq n \\leq 2000)$\u00a0\u2014 the length of the strings. \n\nThe second and the third lines contain strings $s$ and $t$ respectively.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all the test cases does not exceed $2000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations to convert $s$ to $t$. If it is not possible to convert $s$ to $t$, output $-1$ instead.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n1\na\na\n2\nab\nba\n3\nabc\ncab\n3\nabc\ncba\n4\nabab\nbaba\n4\nabcc\naabc\n\nOutput\n0\n1\n1\n2\n1\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the $1$-st test case, since $s$ and $t$ are equal, you don't need to apply any operation.\n\nFor the $2$-nd test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string ab to convert it to ba.\n\nFor the $3$-rd test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string abc to convert it to cab.\n\nFor the $4$-th test case, you need to apply the operation twice: first on the entire string abc to convert it to cab and then on the substring of length $2$ beginning at the second character to convert it to cba.\n\nFor the $5$-th test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string abab to convert it to baba.\n\nFor the $6$-th test case, it is not possible to convert string $s$ to $t$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
