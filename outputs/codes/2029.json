At the same time, he wants to make the diameter of the tree as small as possible.\n\nLet's define the diameter of a weighed tree as the maximum sum of the weights of the edges lying on the path between two some vertices of the tree. In other words, the diameter of a weighed tree is the length of the longest simple path in the tree, where length of a path is equal to the sum of weights over all edges in the path.\n\nFind the minimum possible diameter that Vanya can get.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $s$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq s \\leq 10^9$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of edge weights.\n\nEach of the following $n\u22121$ lines contains two space-separated integer numbers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$, $a_i \\neq b_i$) \u2014 the indexes of vertices connected by an edge. The edges are undirected.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum diameter of the tree that Vanya can get by placing some non-negative real weights on its edges with the sum equal to $s$.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\nFormally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac {|a-b|} {max(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\n2.000000000000000000\nInput\n6 1\n2 1\n2 3\n2 5\n5 4\n5 6\n\nOutput\n0.500000000000000000\nInput\n5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5\n\nOutput\n3.333333333333333333\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is necessary to put weights like this: [Image] \n\nIt is easy to see that the diameter of this tree is $2$.
