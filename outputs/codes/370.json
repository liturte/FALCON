In one stroke, Jumbo Takahashi can perform the following operation:\n - Choose a grid point whose Manhattan distance from the current position of the ball is K, and send the ball to that point.\nThe game is finished when the ball reaches the goal, and the score will be the number of strokes so far. Jumbo Takahashi wants to finish the game with the lowest score possible.\nDetermine if the game can be finished. If the answer is yes, find one way to bring the ball to the goal with the lowest score possible.\nWhat is Manhattan distance?\nThe Manhattan distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is defined as |x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 10^9\n - -10^5 \\leq X, Y \\leq 10^5\n - (X, Y) \\neq (0, 0)\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nK\nX Y\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the game cannot be finished, print -1.\nIf the game can be finished, print one way to bring the ball to the destination with the lowest score possible, in the following format:\ns\nx_1 y_1\nx_2 y_2\n.\n.\n.\nx_s y_s\n\nHere, s is the lowest score possible, and (x_i, y_i) is the position of the ball just after the i-th stroke.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n11\n-1 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n7 4\n2 10\n-1 2\n\n - The Manhattan distance between (0, 0) and (7, 4) is |0-7|+|0-4|=11.\n - The Manhattan distance between (7, 4) and (2, 10) is |7-2|+|4-10|=11.\n - The Manhattan distance between (2, 10) and (-1, 2) is |2-(-1)|+|10-2|=11.\nThus, this play is valid.\nAlso, there is no way to finish the game with less than three strokes.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
