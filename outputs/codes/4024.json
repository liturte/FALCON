Characters to be deleted are not required to go successively, there can be any gaps between them. For example, for the string \"abaca\" the following strings are subsequences: \"abaca\", \"aba\", \"aaa\", \"a\" and \"\" (empty string). But the following strings are not subsequences: \"aabaca\", \"cb\" and \"bcaa\".\n\nYou are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIn one move you can take any subsequence $t$ of the given string and add it to the set $S$. The set $S$ can't contain duplicates. This move costs $n - |t|$, where $|t|$ is the length of the added subsequence (i.e. the price equals to the number of the deleted characters).\n\nYour task is to find out the minimum possible total cost to obtain a set $S$ of size $k$ or report that it is impossible to do so.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 100$) \u2014 the length of the string and the size of the set, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 if it is impossible to obtain the set $S$ of size $k$, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum possible total cost to do it.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\nasdf\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 6\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n15\n\nInput\n5 7\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n10 100\najihiushda\n\nOutput\n233\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can generate $S$ = { \"asdf\", \"asd\", \"adf\", \"asf\", \"sdf\" }. The cost of the first element in $S$ is $0$ and the cost of the others is $1$. So the total cost of $S$ is $4$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
