[Image] \n\nThe steps were numbered from one to infinity. As we know, tigers are very fond of all striped things, it is possible that it has something to do with their color. So on some interval of her way she calculated two values \u2014 the number of steps with even and odd numbers. \n\nYou need to check whether there is an interval of steps from the l-th to the r-th (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r), for which values that Dasha has found are correct.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn the only line you are given two integers a, b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of even and odd steps, accordingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print \"YES\", if the interval of steps described above exists, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example one of suitable intervals is from 1 to 5. The interval contains two even steps\u00a0\u2014 2 and 4, and three odd: 1, 3 and 5.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
