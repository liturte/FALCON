He had to carry cash all the time and his wallet was getting heavy from all the coins he was carrying around. He was once in a candy store buying a few kilos of candy and he wanted to get rid of as many coins as possible but couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it without getting any change back.\n\n-----Task-----\nYou will be given a price $P$ that Per was going to pay. You will also be given the number of 1-, 5-, 10- and 25-cent coins that he had in his wallet. He didn\u2019t have any notes. Find the maximum number of coins he could have used for paying the price $P$ without getting any change back.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $P, 1\\leq P\\leq 100000000$, the price Per was going to pay. On the second line there are 4 space separated integers $N_1, N_5, N_{10}, N_{25}; 0\\leq N_1, N_5, N_{10}, N_{25}\\leq 100000000$, the number of 1-, 5-, 10- and 25-cent coins in Per\u2019s wallet.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Per couldn\u2019t pay exactly $P$ without getting any change back, output Impossible on a single line. Otherwise output the maximum number of coins Per could use to pay the price $P$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n13\n3 2 1 1\nSample Output:\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
