Over the past couple of months, the band has been rehearsing a large number of songs. Now it\u2019s time to go out and perform in front of a crowd for the first time. In order to do so, a set list for the concert needs to be determined.\n\nAs it turns out, every band member has a different taste in music. (Who would have thought?) Everybody is very picky: a band member doesn\u2019t want to play any particular song $X$ unless he also gets to play all songs he likes better than song $X$. This holds for every band member and for every song $X$. Furthermore, obviously at least one song should be performed.\n\nThe organisers of the concert do not want you to play too many songs, so a selection needs to be made that is as small as possible. As the unofficial leader of the band, you have taken it upon yourself to find a minimum length set list that meets the requirements.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains two integers $M$ and $S$, satisfying $M \\geq 1$ and $S \\geq 1$ as well as $M\\cdot S \\leq 10^6$. These denote the total number of band members and the number of songs, respectively.\n\nThe following $M$ lines each contain $S$ integers per line, where the $i$-th line denotes the preference list of the $i$-th band member, starting with his favourite song and ending with his least favourite song. The songs are numbered $1$ through $S$.\n\nNo two band members have the exact same preference lists.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the smallest possible set list, using the following format:\n - One line with an integer $L$: the length of the smallest possible set list.\n - One line with $L$ space-separated integers, denoting a sorted list of the songs to be played.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 8\n4 5 2 1 6 8 3 7\n5 2 4 8 6 1 3 7\n2 5 4 8 1 6 3 7\nSample Output 1:\n3\n2 4 5\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 8\n6 2 8 7 1 3 4 5\n2 8 7 1 3 4 5 6\nSample Output 2:\n8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
