Each city has an army. Army of the i-th city consists of a_{i} soldiers. Now soldiers roam. After roaming each soldier has to either stay in his city or to go to the one of neighboring cities by at moving along at most one road.\n\nCheck if is it possible that after roaming there will be exactly b_{i} soldiers in the i-th city.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input consists of two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 200).\n\nNext line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100).\n\nNext line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (0 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 100).\n\nThen m lines follow, each of them consists of two integers p and q (1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 n, p \u2260 q) denoting that there is an undirected road between cities p and q. \n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one road between each pair of cities.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the conditions can not be met output single word \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise output word \"YES\" and then n lines, each of them consisting of n integers. Number in the i-th line in the j-th column should denote how many soldiers should road from city i to city j (if i \u2260 j) or how many soldiers should stay in city i (if i = j).\n\nIf there are several possible answers you may output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 4\n1 2 6 3\n3 5 3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 2\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 0 0 0 \n2 0 0 0 \n0 5 1 0 \n0 0 2 1 \n\nInput\n2 0\n1 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
