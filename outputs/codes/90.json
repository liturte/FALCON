Today she decided to do just that.\n\nAnya has n cubes lying in a line and numbered from 1 to n from left to right, with natural numbers written on them. She also has k stickers with exclamation marks. We know that the number of stickers does not exceed the number of cubes.\n\nAnya can stick an exclamation mark on the cube and get the factorial of the number written on the cube. For example, if a cube reads 5, then after the sticking it reads 5!, which equals 120.\n\nYou need to help Anya count how many ways there are to choose some of the cubes and stick on some of the chosen cubes at most k exclamation marks so that the sum of the numbers written on the chosen cubes after the sticking becomes equal to S. Anya can stick at most one exclamation mark on each cube. Can you do it?\n\nTwo ways are considered the same if they have the same set of chosen cubes and the same set of cubes with exclamation marks.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, k and S (1 \u2264 n \u2264 25, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 10^16)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of cubes and the number of stickers that Anya has, and the sum that she needs to get. \n\nThe second line contains n positive integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the numbers, written on the cubes. The cubes in the input are described in the order from left to right, starting from the first one. \n\nMultiple cubes can contain the same numbers.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the number of ways to choose some number of cubes and stick exclamation marks on some of them so that the sum of the numbers became equal to the given number S.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 30\n4 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2 2 7\n4 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the only way is to choose both cubes and stick an exclamation mark on each of them.\n\nIn the second sample the only way is to choose both cubes but don't stick an exclamation mark on any of them.\n\nIn the third sample it is possible to choose any of the cubes in three ways, and also we may choose to stick or not to stick the exclamation mark on it. So, the total number of ways is six.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
