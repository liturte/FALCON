Jack is getting older and is becoming tired of this activity he used to love. He thinks of an idea, \u2018The Big One\u2019, and fantasizes about going out into the forest one last time to harvest as many trees as possible.\n\nJack calls the forest administrator for his local evergreen forest. The forest administrator tells him about how the population changes for each species of tree. For each species $k$, $S_ k$ trees are planted in year $B_ k$. For the next $Y_ k$ years, the population increases by $I_ k$ per year. After $Y_ k$ years, it will decrease by the same amount $I_ k$ per year, until possibly dying out.\n\nArmed with this information, Jack wants to figure out the maximum amount of trees that could be harvested at once from now until the future. If he is no longer around to do it, his descendants will be!\n\nAssume all populations change instantly and at the same time, once per year. Jack would assess each population\u2019s size after the yearly change occurred.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input contains a single test case. The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1000$) representing the number of tree species in the forest.\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines represents a single tree species population. Each of these population lines contains $4$ integer numbers Y I S B ($0 \\le Y \\le 1000000$, $0 \\le I \\le 1000$, $0 \\le S \\le 1000000$, $0 \\le B \\le 1000000$). where $S$ is the starting population size, $B$ the year in which the population is planted, $Y$ the number of years during which the population increases each year by $I$ before it decreases by $I$ until it (possibly) dies out.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum amount of trees that can be harvested in any single year.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n1\n10 10 0 5\nSample Output:\n100\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
