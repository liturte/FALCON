Every evening, if the bard is present, he sings a brand new song that no villager has heard before, and no other song is sung that night. In the event that the bard is not present, other villagers sing without him and exchange all songs that they know.\n\nGiven the list of villagers present for $E$ consecutive evenings, output all villagers that know all songs sung during that period.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$, $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$, the number of villagers. The villagers are numbered $1$ to $N$. Villager number $1$ is the bard.\n\nThe second line contains an integer $E$, $1 \\leq E \\leq 50$, the number of evenings.\n\nThe next $E$ lines contain the list of villagers present on each of the $E$ evenings. Each line begins with a positive integer $K$, $2 \\leq K \\leq N$, the number of villagers present that evening, followed by $K$ positive integers separated by spaces representing the villagers.\n\nNo villager will appear twice in one night and the bard will appear at least once across all nights.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput all villagers that know all songs, including the bard, one integer per line in ascending order.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\n3\n2 1 2\n3 2 3 4\n3 4 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n1\n2\n4\n\nSample Input 2:\n8\n5\n4 1 3 5 6\n2 5 6\n3 6 7 8\n2 6 2\n4 2 6 8 1\nSample Output 2:\n1\n2\n6\n8\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
