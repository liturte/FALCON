It can be proved that, under the constraints in this problem, X is an integer not exceeding 10^9.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1 1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3800\n\nIn this input, there is only one case. Takahashi will repeatedly submit the code that correctly solves this case with 1/2 probability in 1900 milliseconds.\nThe code will succeed in one attempt with 1/2 probability, in two attempts with 1/4 probability, and in three attempts with 1/8 probability, and so on.\nThus, the answer is 1900 \\times 1/2 + (2 \\times 1900) \\times 1/4 + (3 \\times 1900) \\times 1/8 + ... = 3800.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
