Let (i, j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left. We will choose K of the squares and put a piece on each of them.\nIf we place the K pieces on squares (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., and (x_K, y_K), the cost of this arrangement is computed as:\n\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^K (|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|)\nFind the sum of the costs of all possible arrangements of the pieces. Since this value can be tremendous, print it modulo 10^9+7.\nWe consider two arrangements of the pieces different if and only if there is a square that contains a piece in one of the arrangements but not in the other.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \\leq N \\times M \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n - 2 \\leq K \\leq N \\times M\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M K\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the sum of the costs of all possible arrangements of the pieces, modulo 10^9+7.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n8\n\nThere are six possible arrangements of the pieces, as follows:\n - ((1,1),(1,2)), with the cost |1-1|+|1-2| = 1\n - ((1,1),(2,1)), with the cost |1-2|+|1-1| = 1\n - ((1,1),(2,2)), with the cost |1-2|+|1-2| = 2\n - ((1,2),(2,1)), with the cost |1-2|+|2-1| = 2\n - ((1,2),(2,2)), with the cost |1-2|+|2-2| = 1\n - ((2,1),(2,2)), with the cost |2-2|+|1-2| = 1\nThe sum of these costs is 8.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
