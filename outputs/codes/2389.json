If s_i is AB, you must add 1 to A or B then subtract 1 from the other; if s_i is AC, you must add 1 to A or C then subtract 1 from the other; if s_i is BC, you must add 1 to B or C then subtract 1 from the other.\nAfter each choice, none of A, B, and C should be negative.\nDetermine whether it is possible to make N choices under this condition. If it is possible, also give one such way to make the choices.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 0 \\leq A,B,C \\leq 10^9\n - N, A, B, C are integers.\n - s_i is AB, AC, or BC.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN A B C\ns_1\ns_2\n:\ns_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf it is possible to make N choices under the condition, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\nAlso, in the former case, show one such way to make the choices in the subsequent N lines. The (i+1)-th line should contain the name of the variable (A, B, or C) to which you add 1 in the i-th choice.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 1 3 0\nAB\nAC\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nYes\nA\nC\n\nYou can successfully make two choices, as follows:\n - In the first choice, add 1 to A and subtract 1 from B. A becomes 2, and B becomes 2.\n - In the second choice, add 1 to C and subtract 1 from A. C becomes 1, and A becomes 1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
