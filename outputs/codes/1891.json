Length of their base is a perfect power of $2$. Thanos wants to destroy the base using minimum power. He starts with the whole base and in one step he can do either of following:   if the current length is at least $2$, divide the base into $2$ equal halves and destroy them separately, or  burn the current base. If it contains no avenger in it, it takes $A$ amount of power, otherwise it takes his $B \\cdot n_a \\cdot l$ amount of power, where $n_a$ is the number of avengers and $l$ is the length of the current base. Output the minimum power needed by Thanos to destroy the avengers' base.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integers $n$, $k$, $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 30$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq A,B \\leq 10^4$), where $2^n$ is the length of the base, $k$ is the number of avengers and $A$ and $B$ are the constants explained in the question.\n\nThe second line contains $k$ integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 2^n$), where $a_{i}$ represents the position of avenger in the base.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the minimum power needed to destroy the avengers base.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n3 2 1 2\n1 7\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example.\n\nOne option for Thanos is to burn the whole base $1-4$ with power $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\n\nOtherwise he can divide the base into two parts $1-2$ and $3-4$.\n\nFor base $1-2$, he can either burn it with power $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$ or divide it into $2$ parts $1-1$ and $2-2$.\n\nFor base $1-1$, he can burn it with power $2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2$. For $2-2$, he can destroy it with power $1$, as there are no avengers. So, the total power for destroying $1-2$ is $2 + 1 = 3$, which is less than $4$. \n\nSimilarly, he needs $3$ power to destroy $3-4$. The total minimum power needed is $6$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
