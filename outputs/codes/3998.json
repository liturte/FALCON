There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is r_{i}.\n\nThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so r_{i} = 0 doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains n non-negative integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n} (0 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 100), where r_{i} is the initial rating of the i-th friend.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer R \u2014 the final rating of each of the friends.\n\nIn the second line, print integer t \u2014 the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following t lines should contain n characters '0' or '1', where the j-th character of the i-th line is equal to:\n\n  '0', if friend j should not play in match i,  '1', if friend j should play in match i. \n\nEach line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.\n\nThe value t should not exceed 10^4, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. \n\nRemember that you shouldn't minimize the value t, but you should maximize R. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 5 1 7 4\n\nOutput\n1\n8\n01010\n00011\n01010\n10010\n00011\n11000\n00011\n11000\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0\n2\n11\n11\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n0\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
