The Corporation has decided to try rebranding\u00a0\u2014 an active marketing strategy, that includes a set of measures to change either the brand (both for the company and the goods it produces) or its components: the name, the logo, the slogan. They decided to start with the name.\n\nFor this purpose the corporation has consecutively hired m designers. Once a company hires the i-th designer, he immediately contributes to the creation of a new corporation name as follows: he takes the newest version of the name and replaces all the letters x_{i} by y_{i}, and all the letters y_{i} by x_{i}. This results in the new version. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string. It may also happen that x_{i} coincides with y_{i}. The version of the name received after the work of the last designer becomes the new name of the corporation.\n\nManager Arkady has recently got a job in this company, but is already soaked in the spirit of teamwork and is very worried about the success of the rebranding. Naturally, he can't wait to find out what is the new name the Corporation will receive.\n\nSatisfy Arkady's curiosity and tell him the final version of the name.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial name and the number of designers hired, respectively.\n\nThe second line consists of n lowercase English letters and represents the original name of the corporation.\n\nNext m lines contain the descriptions of the designers' actions: the i-th of them contains two space-separated lowercase English letters x_{i} and y_{i}.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the new name of the corporation.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 1\npolice\np m\n\nOutput\nmolice\n\nInput\n11 6\nabacabadaba\na b\nb c\na d\ne g\nf a\nb b\n\nOutput\ncdcbcdcfcdc\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample the name of the corporation consecutively changes as follows: $\\text{abacabadaba} \\rightarrow \\text{babcbabdbab}$\n\n$\\text{babcbabdbab} \\rightarrow \\text{cacbcacdcac}$\n\n$\\text{cacbcacdcac} \\rightarrow \\text{cdcbcdcacdc}$\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
