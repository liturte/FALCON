She decided to arrange the animals in a row in the order of non-decreasing height. However, the animals were so scared that they couldn't stay in the right places.\n\nThe robber girl was angry at first, but then she decided to arrange the animals herself. She repeatedly names numbers l and r such that r - l + 1 is even. After that animals that occupy positions between l and r inclusively are rearranged as follows: the animal at position l swaps places with the animal at position l + 1, the animal l + 2 swaps with the animal l + 3, ..., finally, the animal at position r - 1 swaps with the animal r.\n\nHelp the robber girl to arrange the animals in the order of non-decreasing height. You should name at most 20 000 segments, since otherwise the robber girl will become bored and will start scaring the animals again.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 number of animals in the robber girl's zoo.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), where a_{i} is the height of the animal occupying the i-th place.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the sequence of operations that will rearrange the animals by non-decreasing height.\n\nThe output should contain several lines, i-th of the lines should contain two space-separated integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} < r_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 descriptions of segments the robber girl should name. The segments should be described in the order the operations are performed.\n\nThe number of operations should not exceed 20 000.\n\nIf the animals are arranged correctly from the start, you are allowed to output nothing.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 1 4 3\n\nOutput\n1 4\n\nInput\n7\n36 28 57 39 66 69 68\n\nOutput\n1 4\n6 7\n\nInput\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n2 5\n3 4\n1 4\n1 4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
