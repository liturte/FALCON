If some number x is chosen at the current turn, it is forbidden to choose x or all of its other positive integer powers (that is, x^2, x^3, ...) at the next turns. For instance, if the number 9 is chosen at the first turn, one cannot choose 9 or 81 later, while it is still allowed to choose 3 or 27. The one who cannot make a move loses.\n\nWho wins if both Vasya and Petya play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the name of the winner \u2014 \"Vasya\" or \"Petya\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\nVasya\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\nPetya\n\nInput\n8\n\nOutput\nPetya\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Vasya will choose 1 and win immediately.\n\nIn the second sample no matter which number Vasya chooses during his first turn, Petya can choose the remaining number and win.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
