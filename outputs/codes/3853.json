One of his trademark tricks involves a set of magical boxes. The essence of the trick is in packing the boxes inside other boxes.\n\nFrom the top view each magical box looks like a square with side length equal to 2^{k} (k is an integer, k \u2265 0) units. A magical box v can be put inside a magical box u, if side length of v is strictly less than the side length of u. In particular, Emuskald can put 4 boxes of side length 2^{k} - 1 into one box of side length 2^{k}, or as in the following figure:\n\n [Image] \n\nEmuskald is about to go on tour performing around the world, and needs to pack his magical boxes for the trip. He has decided that the best way to pack them would be inside another magical box, but magical boxes are quite expensive to make. Help him find the smallest magical box that can fit all his boxes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of different sizes of boxes Emuskald has. Each of following n lines contains two integers k_{i} and a_{i} (0 \u2264 k_{i} \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), which means that Emuskald has a_{i} boxes with side length 2^{k}_{i}. It is guaranteed that all of k_{i} are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer p, such that the smallest magical box that can contain all of Emuskald\u2019s boxes has side length 2^{p}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n0 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n1\n0 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n2\n1 10\n2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nPicture explanation. If we have 3 boxes with side length 2 and 5 boxes with side length 1, then we can put all these boxes inside a box with side length 4, for example, as shown in the picture.\n\nIn the second test case, we can put all four small boxes into a box with side length 2.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
