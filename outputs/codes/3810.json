Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.\n\nShe labelled all $n$ boxes with $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:\n\n  Pick three distinct indices $i$, $j$ and $k$, such that $a_i \\mid a_j$ and $a_i \\mid a_k$. In other words, $a_i$ divides both $a_j$ and $a_k$, that is $a_j \\bmod a_i = 0$, $a_k \\bmod a_i = 0$.  After choosing, Nora will give the $k$-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.  After doing so, the box $k$ becomes unavailable for any further actions. \n\nBeing amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.\n\nSince ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?\n\nAs the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 60$), denoting the number of boxes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 60$), where $a_i$ is the label of the $i$-th box.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 6 8\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n2 3 4 9 12\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\n5 7 2 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $b$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position.\n\nIn the first example, there are $2$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [6]$ ($[2, \\mathbf{6}, 8] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$)  $b = [8]$ ($[2, 6, \\mathbf{8}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$) \n\nIn the second example, there are $4$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [9, 12]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$)  $b = [4, 12]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$)  $b = [4, 9]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  $b = [9, 4]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$) \n\nIn the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all. Therefore, there is only $1$ valid pile, and that pile is empty.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
