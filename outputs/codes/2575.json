So he purchased a fence-building robot.\n\nHe wants the fence to be a regular polygon. The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle a.\n\nWill the robot be able to build the fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to a?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer t (0 < t < 180) \u2014 the number of tests. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer a (0 < a < 180) \u2014 the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test, output on a single line \"YES\" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and \"NO\" (without quotes), if it is impossible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n30\n60\n90\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since there is no regular polygon with angle $30^{\\circ}$.\n\nIn the second test case, the fence is a regular triangle, and in the last test case \u2014 a square.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
