Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$ are connected by an edge with weight $w_i$.\n\nYou are given $m$ queries. The $i$-th query is given as an integer $q_i$. In this query you need to calculate the number of pairs of vertices $(u, v)$ ($u < v$) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between $u$ and $v$ doesn't exceed $q_i$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $w_i$ \u2014 the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\ne v_i$) and the weight of the edge ($1 \\le w_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nThe last line of the input contains $m$ integers $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_m$ ($1 \\le q_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $q_i$ is the maximum weight of an edge in the $i$-th query.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $m$ integers \u2014 the answers to the queries. The $i$-th value should be equal to the number of pairs of vertices $(u, v)$ ($u < v$) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between $u$ and $v$ doesn't exceed $q_i$.\n\nQueries are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in the order of the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 5\n1 2 1\n3 2 3\n2 4 1\n4 5 2\n5 7 4\n3 6 2\n5 2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n21 7 15 21 3 \n\nInput\n1 2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0 0 \n\nInput\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 3 2\n\nOutput\n1 3 3 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe picture shows the tree from the first example: [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
