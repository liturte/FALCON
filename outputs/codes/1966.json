Though what he saw in his locker shocked him! His favourite chessboard got broken into 4 pieces, each of size n by n, n is always odd. And what's even worse, some squares were of wrong color. j-th square of the i-th row of k-th piece of the board has color a_{k}, i, j; 1 being black and 0 being white. \n\nNow Magnus wants to change color of some squares in such a way that he recolors minimum number of squares and obtained pieces form a valid chessboard. Every square has its color different to each of the neightbouring by side squares in a valid board. Its size should be 2n by 2n. You are allowed to move pieces but not allowed to rotate or flip them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains odd integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the size of all pieces of the board. \n\nThen 4 segments follow, each describes one piece of the board. Each consists of n lines of n characters; j-th one of i-th line is equal to 1 if the square is black initially and 0 otherwise. Segments are separated by an empty line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number \u2014 minimum number of squares Magnus should recolor to be able to obtain a valid chessboard.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n101\n010\n101\n\n101\n000\n101\n\n010\n101\n011\n\n010\n101\n010\n\nOutput\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
