All the jars are numbered from 1 to n and the i-th jar contains a_{i} liters of paint of color i.\n\nVika also has an infinitely long rectangular piece of paper of width 1, consisting of squares of size 1 \u00d7 1. Squares are numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. Vika decided that she will start painting squares one by one from left to right, starting from the square number 1 and some arbitrary color. If the square was painted in color x, then the next square will be painted in color x + 1. In case of x = n, next square is painted in color 1. If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.\n\nSquare is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly 1 liter of paint. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of squares that might be painted, if Vika chooses right color to paint the first square.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of jars with colors Vika has.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), where a_{i} is equal to the number of liters of paint in the i-th jar, i.e. the number of liters of color i that Vika has.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line of the output should contain a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of squares that Vika can paint if she follows the rules described above.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 4 2 3 3\n\nOutput\n12\n\nInput\n3\n5 5 5\n\nOutput\n15\n\nInput\n6\n10 10 10 1 10 10\n\nOutput\n11\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the best strategy is to start painting using color 4. Then the squares will be painted in the following colors (from left to right): 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIn the second sample Vika can start to paint using any color.\n\nIn the third sample Vika should start painting using color number 5.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
