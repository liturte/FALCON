Then follow R lines, each containing C space separated integers - the costs of different gifts.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single integer - a value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but highest in its column. If no such value exists, then print \"GUESS\" (without quotes of course) \n\n-----Constraints-----\n1 <= R, C <= 100 \nAll gift costs are positive and less than 100000000 (10^8) \n\n-----Example 1-----\nInput:\n2 3\n9 8 8\n2 6 11\n\nOutput:\n8\n\n-----Example 2-----\nInput:\n3 3\n9 8 11\n2 6 34\n5 9 11\n\nOutput:\nGUESS\n\n-----Example 3-----\nInput:\n2 2\n10 10\n10 10\n\nOutput:\n10\n\n-----Explanation of Sample Cases-----\nExample 1: The first row contains 9, 8, 8. Observe that both 8 are the minimum. Considering the first 8, look at the corresponding column (containing 8 and 6). Here, 8 is the largest element in that column. So it will be chosen.\nExample 2: There is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column.\nExample 3: The required gift in matrix is not determined uniquely, but the required cost is determined uniquely.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
