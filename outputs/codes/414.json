It is guaranteed that all segments' endpoints are integers, and all endpoints are unique \u2014 there is no pair of segments such that they start in the same point, end in the same point or one starts in the same point the other one ends.\n\nLet's generate a graph with $n$ vertices from these segments. Vertices $v$ and $u$ are connected by an edge if and only if segments $[l_v, r_v]$ and $[l_u, r_u]$ intersect and neither of it lies fully inside the other one.\n\nFor example, pairs $([1, 3], [2, 4])$ and $([5, 10], [3, 7])$ will induce the edges but pairs $([1, 2], [3, 4])$ and $([5, 7], [3, 10])$ will not.\n\nDetermine if the resulting graph is a tree or not.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of segments.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contain the description of the $i$-th segment \u2014 two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 2n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all segments borders are pairwise distinct. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" if the resulting graph is a tree and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n9 12\n2 11\n1 3\n6 10\n5 7\n4 8\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n5\n1 3\n2 4\n5 9\n6 8\n7 10\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n5\n5 8\n3 6\n2 9\n7 10\n1 4\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe graph corresponding to the first example:\n\n[Image]\n\nThe graph corresponding to the second example:\n\n[Image]\n\nThe graph corresponding to the third example:\n\n[Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
