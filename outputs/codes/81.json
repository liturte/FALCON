During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.\n\nNeko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.\n\nGiven his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \\ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.\n\nIf there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 10\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n21 31\n\nOutput\n9\nInput\n5 10\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
