Dima has recently written a song and they want to play it together. Of course, Sereja wants to listen to the song very much. \n\nA song is a sequence of notes. Dima and Inna want to play each note at the same time. At that, they can play the i-th note at volume v (1 \u2264 v \u2264 a_{i}; v is an integer) both on the piano and the guitar. They should retain harmony, so the total volume with which the i-th note was played on the guitar and the piano must equal b_{i}. If Dima and Inna cannot play a note by the described rules, they skip it and Sereja's joy drops by 1. But if Inna and Dima play the i-th note at volumes x_{i} and y_{i} (x_{i} + y_{i} = b_{i}) correspondingly, Sereja's joy rises by x_{i}\u00b7y_{i}. \n\nSereja has just returned home from the university and his current joy is 0. Help Dima and Inna play the song so as to maximize Sereja's total joy after listening to the whole song!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of notes in the song. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^6). The third line contains n integers b_{i} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 10^6).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print an integer \u2014 the maximum possible joy Sereja feels after he listens to a song.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 1 2\n2 2 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n1\n2\n5\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Dima and Inna play the first two notes at volume 1 (1 + 1 = 2, the condition holds), they should play the last note at volumes 1 and 2. Sereja's total joy equals: 1\u00b71 + 1\u00b71 + 1\u00b72 = 4.\n\nIn the second sample, there is no such pair (x, y), that 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 2, x + y = 5, so Dima and Inna skip a note. Sereja's total joy equals -1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
