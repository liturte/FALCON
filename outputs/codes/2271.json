This means that it is a collection of n points (called vertices), some of which are connected using n - 1 line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by a path (a sequence of one or more edges).\n\nTo decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number of lifelines in the tree \u2013 these are paths of length 2, i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n \u2013 the number of vertices in the tree (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to n. Then n - 1 lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers a\u2002b \u2013 the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2013 the number of lifelines in the tree.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, there are four lifelines: paths between vertices 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 5.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
