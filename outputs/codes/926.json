Kostya has a friend Zahar who works at a career. Zahar knows about Kostya's idea and wants to present him a rectangular parallelepiped of marble from which he can carve the sphere. \n\nZahar has n stones which are rectangular parallelepipeds. The edges sizes of the i-th of them are a_{i}, b_{i} and c_{i}. He can take no more than two stones and present them to Kostya. \n\nIf Zahar takes two stones, he should glue them together on one of the faces in order to get a new piece of rectangular parallelepiped of marble. Thus, it is possible to glue a pair of stones together if and only if two faces on which they are glued together match as rectangles. In such gluing it is allowed to rotate and flip the stones in any way. \n\nHelp Zahar choose such a present so that Kostya can carve a sphere of the maximum possible volume and present it to Zahar.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nn lines follow, in the i-th of which there are three integers a_{i}, b_{i} and c_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of edges of the i-th stone. Note, that two stones may have exactly the same sizes, but they still will be considered two different stones.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 2) the number of stones which Zahar has chosen. In the second line print k distinct integers from 1 to n\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of stones which Zahar needs to choose. Consider that stones are numbered from 1 to n in the order as they are given in the input data.\n\nYou can print the stones in arbitrary order. If there are several answers print any of them. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n5 5 5\n3 2 4\n1 4 1\n2 1 3\n3 2 4\n3 3 4\n\nOutput\n1\n1\n\nInput\n7\n10 7 8\n5 10 3\n4 2 6\n5 5 5\n10 2 8\n4 2 1\n7 7 7\n\nOutput\n2\n1 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can connect the pairs of stones:  2 and 4, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1  2 and 5, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8 or 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 or 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1, or 1, or 1.5 respectively.  2 and 6, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5  4 and 5, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1  5 and 6, the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5 \n\nOr take only one stone:  1 the size of the parallelepiped: 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere 2.5  2 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1  3 the size of the parallelepiped: 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1, the radius of the inscribed sphere 0.5  4 the size of the parallelepiped: 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3, the radius of the inscribed sphere 0.5  5 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1  6 the size of the parallelepiped: 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere 1.5 \n\nIt is most profitable to take only the first stone.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
