There were several fax messages among them. He concatenated these strings in some order and now he has string s.\n\n [Image] \n\nHe is not sure if this is his own back-bag or someone else's. He remembered that there were exactly k messages in his own bag, each was a palindrome string and all those strings had the same length.\n\nHe asked you to help him and tell him if he has worn his own back-bag. Check if the given string s is a concatenation of k palindromes of the same length.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains string s containing lowercase English letters (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 1000).\n\nThe second line contains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\"(without quotes) if he has worn his own back-bag or \"NO\"(without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nsaba\n2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\nsaddastavvat\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nPalindrome is a string reading the same forward and backward.\n\nIn the second sample, the faxes in his back-bag can be \"saddas\" and \"tavvat\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
