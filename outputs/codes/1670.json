He has learned that for some fouls the players receive yellow cards, and for some fouls they receive red cards. A player who receives the second yellow card automatically receives a red card.\n\nVasya is watching a recorded football match now and makes notes of all the fouls that he would give a card for. Help Vasya determine all the moments in time when players would be given red cards if Vasya were the judge. For each player, Vasya wants to know only the first moment of time when he would receive a red card from Vasya.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the name of the team playing at home. The second line contains the name of the team playing away. Both lines are not empty. The lengths of both lines do not exceed 20. Each line contains only of large English letters. The names of the teams are distinct.\n\nNext follows number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 90) \u2014 the number of fouls. \n\nEach of the following n lines contains information about a foul in the following form:   first goes number t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 90) \u2014 the minute when the foul occurs;  then goes letter \"h\" or letter \"a\" \u2014 if the letter is \"h\", then the card was given to a home team player, otherwise the card was given to an away team player;  then goes the player's number m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 99);  then goes letter \"y\" or letter \"r\" \u2014 if the letter is \"y\", that means that the yellow card was given, otherwise the red card was given. \n\nThe players from different teams can have the same number. The players within one team have distinct numbers. The fouls go chronologically, no two fouls happened at the same minute.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each event when a player received his first red card in a chronological order print a string containing the following information:  The name of the team to which the player belongs;  the player's number in his team;  the minute when he received the card. \n\nIf no player received a card, then you do not need to print anything.\n\nIt is possible case that the program will not print anything to the output (if there were no red cards).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nMC\nCSKA\n9\n28 a 3 y\n62 h 25 y\n66 h 42 y\n70 h 25 y\n77 a 4 y\n79 a 25 y\n82 h 42 r\n89 h 16 y\n90 a 13 r\n\nOutput\nMC 25 70\nMC 42 82\nCSKA 13 90\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
