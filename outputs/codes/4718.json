The document has a column where the current date is written in yyyy/mm/dd format. For example, January 23, 2018 should be written as 2018/01/23.\nAfter finishing the document, she noticed that she had mistakenly wrote 2017 at the beginning of the date column. Write a program that, when the string that Takaki wrote in the date column, S, is given as input, modifies the first four characters in S to 2018 and prints it.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is a string of length 10.\n - The first eight characters in S are 2017/01/.\n - The last two characters in S are digits and represent an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nReplace the first four characters in S with 2018 and print it.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2017/01/07\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2018/01/07\n\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
