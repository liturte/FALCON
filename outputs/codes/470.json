He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.\n\nLimak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.\n\nHe is allowed to at most once discard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.\n\nGiven five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains five integers t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 and t_5 (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 numbers written on cards.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 7 3 20\n\nOutput\n26\n\nInput\n7 9 3 1 8\n\nOutput\n28\n\nInput\n10 10 10 10 10\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20. Limak can do one of the following.\n\n  Do nothing and the sum would be 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40.  Remove two cards with a number 7. The remaining sum would be 3 + 3 + 20 = 26.  Remove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34. \n\nYou are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26.\n\nIn the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28.\n\nIn the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is 10 + 10 = 20.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
