At the end of the year you are expected to file your taxes, which requires you to track and report the total number of shares you held during any of your trading days during the year.\n\nThe records you have kept are sorted by company: for each company, you have a list of notes stating how many shares of that company you owned on a given day.\n\nYour tax accountant has asked you to produce a list of the total number of shares across all companies you have held on each of the days on which you have traded and recorded your holdings.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $C$ ($1 \\le C \\le 20$), the total number of companies of which you hold shares. Next will be $C$ blocks of records, one for each company.\n\nEach record block starts with an integer $K$ ($1 \\le K \\le 50$), which is the number of records you have kept for this company. This is followed by $K$ lines of input, each containing two integers $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1000$) and $D$ ($1 \\le D \\le 365$), denoting that you held $N$ shares of this company on day $D$. The days in the input may be specified in any order.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint, on a single line, for each day for which you have at least one record, the total number of shares held on that day. The share totals shall be printed in increasing order of trading days.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n2\n20 100\n100 10\n1\n150 50\n1\n150 100\nSample Output:\n100 250 320\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
