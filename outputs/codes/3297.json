Here are the rules:\n - A given letter must always be replaced by the same digit.\n - Different letters must be replaced by different digits.\n - The leading (leftmost) letter of any word cannot be replaced by\u00a00.\n\nFor example, if we try to solve the above puzzle, we find that the following replacements work:S$\\rightarrow $9, E$\\rightarrow $5, N$\\rightarrow $6, D$\\rightarrow $7, M$\\rightarrow $1, O$\\rightarrow $0, R$\\rightarrow $8, Y$\\rightarrow $2\n\nThis gives us a correct equality:9567+1085=10652\n\nYour task is to write a program to solve such puzzles. Note that some cryptarithmetic puzzles are impossible to solve. An example is:A+A=A\n\nHere the only way to make the equality hold is to replace A with\u00a00, but this violates the rule that the first (and in this case only) letter of any word cannot be replaced by\u00a00.\n\nAlso note that some puzzles may have multiple solutions. In this situation, find the solution in which the alphabetically lowest letter is replaced by lowest possible digit, then the second lowest letter is replaced by the lowest possible unused digit, then the third lowest letter is replaced by the lowest possible unused digit, etc. An example is:C+B=A\n\nClearly this has more than one solution, but the minimal solution, as described above, is:2+1=3\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a line containing a single puzzle. A puzzle is a string of characters of the form $w_1$+$w_2$=$w_3$, where $w1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ are words, and \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018=\u2019 are the usual \u201cplus\u201d and \u201dequals\u201d characters (ASCII values $43$ and $61$, respectively). A word is a nonempty string of uppercase letters (A\u2013Z). The maximum length of any puzzle is $100$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each puzzle, output a single line containing the minimal solution if the puzzle is solvable, or \u201cimpossible\u201d if the puzzle is not solvable. Note that a solution must contain exactly the same number of characters as the corresponding puzzle, with \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018=\u2019 characters in the same positions as in the puzzle, and all letters replaced by digits (0\u20139).\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nSEND+MORE=MONEY\nSample Output 1:\n9567+1085=10652\n\nSample Input 2:\nA+A=A\nSample Output 2:\nimpossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
