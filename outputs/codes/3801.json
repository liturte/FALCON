The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $i$-th picture has a non-negative weight $w_i$, and the probability of the $i$-th picture being displayed is $\\frac{w_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.\n\nHowever, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. \n\nTo solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $1$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $1$ from its weight.\n\nNauuo will visit the website $m$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $m$ visits modulo $998244353$. Can you help her?\n\nThe expected weight of the $i$-th picture can be denoted by $\\frac {q_i} {p_i}$ where $\\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, you need to print an integer $r_i$ satisfying $0\\le r_i<998244353$ and $r_i\\cdot p_i\\equiv q_i\\pmod{998244353}$. It can be proved that such $r_i$ exists and is unique.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1\\le n\\le 50$, $1\\le m\\le 50$) \u2014 the number of pictures and the number of visits to the website.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$) \u2014 if $a_i=0$ , Nauuo does not like the $i$-th picture; otherwise Nauuo likes the $i$-th picture. It is guaranteed that there is at least one picture which Nauuo likes.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n$ ($1\\le w_i\\le50$) \u2014 the initial weights of the pictures.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe output contains $n$ integers $r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n$ \u2014 the expected weights modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1\n0 1\n2 1\n\nOutput\n332748119\n332748119\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3 3\n0 1 1\n4 3 5\n\nOutput\n160955686\n185138929\n974061117\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, if the only visit shows the first picture with a probability of $\\frac 2 3$, the final weights are $(1,1)$; if the only visit shows the second picture with a probability of $\\frac1 3$, the final weights are $(2,2)$.\n\nSo, both expected weights are $\\frac2 3\\cdot 1+\\frac 1 3\\cdot 2=\\frac4 3$ .\n\nBecause $332748119\\cdot 3\\equiv 4\\pmod{998244353}$, you need to print $332748119$ instead of $\\frac4 3$ or $1.3333333333$.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one picture which Nauuo likes, so every time Nauuo visits the website, $w_1$ will be increased by $1$.\n\nSo, the expected weight is $1+2=3$.\n\nNauuo is very naughty so she didn't give you any hint of the third example.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
