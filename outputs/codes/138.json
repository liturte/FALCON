She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 \u2264 n, a, b, c \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1 3 4\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4 4 4 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutput\n1000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. \n\nIn the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.\n\nIn the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.\n\nIn the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
