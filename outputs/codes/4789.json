There you are given a permit form that must be signed by $K$ city clerks whose names are printed at the bottom of the form.\n\nEntering the clerks\u2019 room, you find a long line of people working their way down a narrow aisle along the clerks\u2019 desks. Their desks are arranged in increasing numeric order. The aisle is so narrow that the line is forced to shuffle forward, single file, past each of the clerks\u2019 desk in turn. Once in the line you cannot leave, back up, or change positions with other people.\n\nAs you present your permit for a signature, you are told that no clerk will sign unless all of the signatures above his or her name on the permit form have already been filled in. To your dismay, the clerks\u2019 desks are not arranged in the same order as the names on your form.\n\nHow many times do you need to pass through the line until you can get your permit?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $K$, the number of signatures you need to collect ($1 \\leq K \\leq 100$).\n\nThis is followed by $K$ lines of input, each containing an integer in the range $1\\ldots 100$, indicating the desk numbers of each of the clerks whose signature you need, in the order that they appear on your form. (Clerks whose signatures are not needed on your form are omitted from this list.)\n\nFor example, the input\n\n    5 1 23 18 13 99\n\nmeans that you need $5$ signatures. The first must come from the clerk in desk #$1$, the next from the clerk in desk #$23$, and so on, with the final signature coming from the clerk in desk #$99$.\n\nNo desk number appears more than once in the input.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line containing an integer denoting the number of passes you need to make through the line until you can collect the signatures that you need.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n1\n23\n18\n13\n99\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n11\n20\n33\n40\n55\nSample Output 2:\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
