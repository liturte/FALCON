You are allowed to modify the structure of the tree through the following multi-step operation:  Choose three vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $b$ is adjacent to both $a$ and $c$.  For every vertex $d$ other than $b$ that is adjacent to $a$, remove the edge connecting $d$ and $a$ and add the edge connecting $d$ and $c$.  Delete the edge connecting $a$ and $b$ and add the edge connecting $a$ and $c$. \n\nAs an example, consider the following tree: [Image] \n\nThe following diagram illustrates the sequence of steps that happen when we apply an operation to vertices $2$, $4$, and $5$: [Image] \n\nIt can be proven that after each operation, the resulting graph is still a tree.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations that must be performed to transform the tree into a star. A star is a tree with one vertex of degree $n - 1$, called its center, and $n - 1$ vertices of degree $1$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$) denoting that there exists an edge connecting vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations needed to transform the tree into a star.\n\nIt can be proven that under the given constraints, it is always possible to transform the tree into a star using at most $10^{18}$ operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n4 5\n2 6\n3 2\n1 2\n2 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4\n2 4\n4 1\n3 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case corresponds to the tree shown in the statement. As we have seen before, we can transform the tree into a star with center at vertex $5$ by applying a single operation to vertices $2$, $4$, and $5$.\n\nIn the second test case, the given tree is already a star with the center at vertex $4$, so no operations have to be performed.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
