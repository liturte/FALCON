The i-th ordinary guest has a power of A_i.\nTakahashi has decided to perform M handshakes to increase the happiness of the party (let the current happiness be 0).\nA handshake will be performed as follows:\n - Takahashi chooses one (ordinary) guest x for his left hand and another guest y for his right hand (x and y can be the same).\n - Then, he shakes the left hand of Guest x and the right hand of Guest y simultaneously to increase the happiness by A_x+A_y.\nHowever, Takahashi should not perform the same handshake more than once. Formally, the following condition must hold:\n - Assume that, in the k-th handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest x_k and the right hand of Guest y_k. Then, there is no pair p, q (1 \\leq p < q \\leq M) such that (x_p,y_p)=(x_q,y_q).\nWhat is the maximum possible happiness after M handshakes?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq M \\leq N^2\n - 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nA_1 A_2 ...
