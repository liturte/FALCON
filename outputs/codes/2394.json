The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple path between them.\n\nLimak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of n vertices, numbered 1 through n.\n\nLimak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to any vertex within distance at most k.\n\nFor a pair of vertices (s, t) we define f(s, t) as the minimum number of jumps Limak needs to get from s to t. Your task is to find the sum of f(s, t) over all pairs of vertices (s, t) such that s < t.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum allowed jump distance respectively.\n\nThe next n - 1 lines describe edges in the tree.

Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at most 2. For example, from the vertex 5 he can jump to any of vertices: 1, 2 and 4 (well, he can also jump to the vertex 5 itself). [Image] \n\nThere are $\\frac{n \\cdot(n - 1)}{2} = 15$ pairs of vertices (s, t) such that s < t. For 5 of those pairs Limak would need two jumps: (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6). For other 10 pairs one jump is enough. So, the answer is 5\u00b72 + 10\u00b71 = 20.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly. There are 3 pairs of vertices (s < t), so the answer is 3\u00b71 = 3.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
