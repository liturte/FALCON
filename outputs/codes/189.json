The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.\n\nA stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \\le 1$.\n\nSalem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. \n\nAs an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of the sticks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost.
