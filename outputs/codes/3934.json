You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.\n\nYou are given a tree with $n$ nodes. In the beginning, $0$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$.\n\nFor example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $2$ on the path from $7$ to $6$, and then adding $-0.5$ on the path from $4$ to $5$. \n\n [Image] \n\nIs it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?\n\nLeaf is a node of a tree of degree $1$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of nodes.\n\nEach of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n$, $u \\neq v$), meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a configuration of real numbers written on edges of the tree that we can't achieve by performing the operations, output \"NO\". \n\nOtherwise, output \"YES\". \n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\nNO\nInput\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n\nOutput\nNO\nInput\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2 6\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we can add any real $x$ to the value written on the only edge $(1, 2)$.\n\n [Image] \n\nIn the second example, one of configurations that we can't reach is $0$ written on $(1, 2)$ and $1$ written on $(2, 3)$.\n\n $8$ \n\nBelow you can see graphs from examples $3$, $4$:\n\n [Image] \n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
