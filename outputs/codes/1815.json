She wants to invite all friends of her to the house so they can play monopoly. However, her house is too small, so she can only invite one friend at a time.\n\nFor each of the $n$ days since the day Shiro moved to the new house, there will be exactly one cat coming to the Shiro's house. The cat coming in the $i$-th day has a ribbon with color $u_i$. Shiro wants to know the largest number $x$, such that if we consider the streak of the first $x$ days, it is possible to remove exactly one day from this streak so that every ribbon color that has appeared among the remaining $x - 1$ will have the same number of occurrences.\n\nFor example, consider the following sequence of $u_i$: $[2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 4, 5]$. Then $x = 7$ makes a streak, since if we remove the leftmost $u_i = 5$, each ribbon color will appear exactly twice in the prefix of $x - 1$ days. Note that $x = 8$ doesn't form a streak, since you must remove exactly one day. \n\nSince Shiro is just a cat, she is not very good at counting and needs your help finding the longest streak.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of days.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n$ ($1 \\leq u_i \\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the colors of the ribbons the cats wear. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer $x$\u00a0\u2014 the largest possible streak of days.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n13\n1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5\n\nOutput\n13\nInput\n5\n10 100 20 200 1\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n1\n100000\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n7\n3 2 1 1 4 5 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n6\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, we can choose the longest streak of $13$ days, since upon removing the last day out of the streak, all of the remaining colors $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ will have the same number of occurrences of $3$. Note that the streak can also be $10$ days (by removing the $10$-th day from this streak) but we are interested in the longest streak.\n\nIn the fourth example, if we take the streak of the first $6$ days, we can remove the third day from this streak then all of the remaining colors $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$ will occur exactly once.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
