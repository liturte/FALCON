But is that really so?\n\nThe National Statistics Department has tracked the falling of apples in a fruit garden for $G$ consecutive years. The fruit garden can be represented as a matrix with dimensions $R \\times S$. Each field of the matrix can contain more than one apple tree.\n\nInterestingly enough, each year there was exactly one apple fall, so the Department decided to write down $G$ pairs of numbers $(r_ i, s_ i)$ that denote the row and column of the location where the apple fell during the $i$-th year. Moreover, by next year, a new tree grew at that location.\n\nYour task is to determine the squared distance between the nearest tree and the apple that fell, measured in unit fields of the matrix (we assume it is that tree from which the apple fell).\n\nThe distance between fields $(r_1, s_1)$ and $(r_2, s_2)$ in the matrix are calculated as\\begin{equation*} d((r_1, s_1),(r_2, s_2)) = \\sqrt {(r_1-r_2)^2 + (s_1-s_2)^2} \\end{equation*}\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains two integers, $R$ and $S$ ($1 \\leq R, S \\leq 500$), the number of rows and columns of the matrix.\n\nEach of the following $R$ lines contains $S$ characters \u2019x\u2019 or \u2019.\u2019. The character \u2019.\u2019 denotes an empty field, and the character \u2019x\u2019 denotes a field with at least one tree.\n\nThe fruit garden will initially contain at least one tree.\n\nAfter that, an integer $G$ ($1 \\leq G \\leq 10^5$) follows, the number of years the fruit garden has been under observation.\n\nEach of the following $G$ lines describes the falls of the apples. Each line contains a pair of space-separated integers $r_ i$, $s_ i$ that denote the row and column of the location where the apple fell in the $i$-th year ($1 \\leq r_ i \\leq R$, $1 \\leq s_ i \\leq S$).\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput $G$ numbers, the required squared distances from the task, each in its own line.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3 3\nx..\n...\n...\n3\n1 3\n1 1\n3 2\nSample Output:\n4\n0\n5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
