Patrick is sure that his scores across $n$ sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores $1$ point, in the second game he scores $2$ points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up! \n\nDefine a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on $[1,2,3]$ can yield $[3,1,2]$ but it cannot yield $[3,2,1]$ since the $2$ is in the same position. \n\nGiven a permutation of $n$ integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed $10^{18}$.\n\nAn array $a$ is a subarray of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the length of the given permutation.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$ ($1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n$) \u00a0\u2014 the initial permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output one integer: the minimum number of special exchanges needed to sort the permutation.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n7\n3 2 4 5 1 6 7\n\nOutput\n0\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first permutation, it is already sorted so no exchanges are needed.\n\nIt can be shown that you need at least $2$ exchanges to sort the second permutation.\n\n$[3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7]$\n\nPerform special exchange on range ($1, 5$)\n\n$[4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]$\n\nPerform special exchange on range ($1, 4$)\n\n$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
