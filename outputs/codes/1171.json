There may be jewels with negative values.\nIn the beginning, you have no jewel in your hands.\nYou can perform at most K operations on D, chosen from the following, at most K times (possibly zero):\n - Operation A: Take out the leftmost jewel contained in D and have it in your hand. You cannot do this operation when D is empty.\n - Operation B: Take out the rightmost jewel contained in D and have it in your hand. You cannot do this operation when D is empty.\n - Operation C: Choose a jewel in your hands and insert it to the left end of D. You cannot do this operation when you have no jewel in your hand.\n - Operation D: Choose a jewel in your hands and insert it to the right end of D. You cannot do this operation when you have no jewel in your hand.\nFind the maximum possible sum of the values of jewels in your hands after the operations.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 50\n - 1 \\leq K \\leq 100\n - -10^7 \\leq V_i \\leq 10^7\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN K\nV_1 V_2 ...

You take out the jewel of value -10 from the left end of D.\n - Do operation B. You take out the jewel of value 6 from the right end of D.\n - Do operation A. You take out the jewel of value 8 from the left end of D.\n - Do operation D. You insert the jewel of value -10 to the right end of D.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
