He promptly called his friend Slavko to play with him. They made a battlefield \u2013 a wooden board consisting of squares in $N$ rows and $N$ columns.\n\nEach tank can be moved to one of the four neighbouring squares in a single move. A tank can shoot at any square in the same row and column. The tank is said to be guarding the row and column it is in.\n\nAdditionally, no two tanks can be in the same square at any time.\n\nAfter many hours of play and two previous attempts, Mirko\u2019s mom yelled at them to come down for lunch again, and they decided to rearrange the tanks so that each tank guards a different row and column (meaning also that each row and column contains only one tank).\n\nHowever, they want to do this using the minimum number of moves.\n\nWrite a program that finds the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the tanks so that each row and each column contains a single tank, and one such shortest sequence of moves.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($3 \\le N \\le 500$).\n\nEach of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \\le R, S \\le N$), the row and column of a single tank at the moment of mom\u2019s call. No two tanks are on the same square.\n\nRows and columns are marked $1$ through $N$, top-down and left-to-right.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the minimum number of moves (call this number $K$) on the first line.\n\nEach of the next $K$ lines should contain the tank being moved and the direction it is moved in, separated by a single space.\n\nTanks are numbered $1$ through $N$, in the order in which they are given in the input.\n\nThe direction can be one of four uppercase letters: \u2018L\u2019 for left, \u2018R\u2019 for right, \u2018U\u2019 for up and \u2018D\u2019 for down.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, any one will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\nSample Output 1:\n10\n1 D\n2 D\n3 D\n4 D\n1 D\n2 D\n3 D\n1 D\n2 D\n1 D\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\n2 3\n3 2\n3 3\n3 4\n4 3\nSample Output 2:\n8\n1 R\n1 R\n2 U\n2 U\n4 D\n4 D\n5 L\n5 L\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
