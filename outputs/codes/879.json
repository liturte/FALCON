Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $p_i$ \u2014 the index of the router to which the $i$-th router was connected after being purchased ($p_i < i$).\n\nThere are $n$ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $n$-th router.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 200000$) \u2014 the number of the routers. The following line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i < i$), where $p_i$ is equal to index of the router to which the $i$-th was connected after purchase.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the path from the $1$-st to the $n$-th router. It starts with $1$ and ends with $n$. All the elements in the path should be distinct.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n8\n1 1 2 2 3 2 5\n\nOutput\n1 2 5 8 \nInput\n6\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \nInput\n7\n1 1 2 3 4 3\n\nOutput\n1 3 7\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
