He owns $n$ lights, all of which flash periodically.\n\nAfter taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$. Light with parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$ will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every $a_i$ seconds starting from the $b_i$-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments $b_i$, $b_i + a_i$, $b_i + 2 \\cdot a_i$ and so on.\n\nYou know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.\n\n [Image] Here is a graphic for the first example. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$), the number of lights.\n\nThe next line contains a string $s$ of $n$ characters. The $i$-th character is \"1\", if the $i$-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise, $i$-th character is \"0\".\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 5$) \u00a0\u2014 the parameters of the $i$-th light.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n101\n3 3\n3 2\n3 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n1111\n3 4\n5 2\n3 1\n3 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n6\n011100\n5 3\n5 5\n2 4\n3 5\n4 2\n1 5\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor first example, the lamps' states are shown in the picture above. The largest number of simultaneously on lamps is $2$ (e.g. at the moment $2$).\n\nIn the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is $4$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
