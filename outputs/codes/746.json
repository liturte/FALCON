He is hurrying up to work so he wants to get out of his house as soon as possible. New app suggested n available Beru-taxi nearby. The i-th taxi is located at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) and moves with a speed v_{i}. \n\nConsider that each of n drivers will move directly to Vasiliy and with a maximum possible speed. Compute the minimum time when Vasiliy will get in any of Beru-taxi cars.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers a and b ( - 100 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of Vasiliy's home.\n\nThe second line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of available Beru-taxi cars nearby. \n\nThe i-th of the following n lines contains three integers x_{i}, y_{i} and v_{i} ( - 100 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the i-th car and its speed.\n\nIt's allowed that several cars are located at the same point. Also, cars may be located at exactly the same point where Vasiliy lives.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single real value\u00a0\u2014 the minimum time Vasiliy needs to get in any of the Beru-taxi cars. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n0 0\n2\n2 0 1\n0 2 2\n\nOutput\n1.00000000000000000000\nInput\n1 3\n3\n3 3 2\n-2 3 6\n-2 7 10\n\nOutput\n0.50000000000000000000\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, first taxi will get to Vasiliy in time 2, and second will do this in time 1, therefore 1 is the answer.\n\nIn the second sample, cars 2 and 3 will arrive simultaneously.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
