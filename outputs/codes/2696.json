The professor could see $n$ cubes at a time. On the day before, he had painted the first $n$ cubes from the left with various colours.\nAli was allowed to choose any painted cube to initially stand on (say $X$). Zafar was asked to stand on the last painted cube (the $n^{th}$ cube) with the professor.\nThe two students were given an activity each:\n- Ali had to shout out the colour of the cube he is standing on.\n- Zafar had to paint the adjacent cube on the right of him with that colour.\nBoth Ali and Zafar had to take one step to the right each time they performed their activity.\nThe Professor jumped along with Zafar, and never left his side. Throughout the activity he was looking leftwards keeping an eye on Ali. They were given a gold star and were allowed to go home when all the cubes that the professor could see at the time were painted with the same color.\nAli wanted to choose a position furthest from the professor and also wanted the gold star.\nCan you help Ali to choose this position $X$?\nThe cubes are numbered from 1 starting from the first painted cube.\nThe colours are represented as integers.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains one integer n, the number of cubes initially painted.\n- The second line contains n space-separated integers: $a_1$,\u2009$a_2$,\u2009$\\dots$,\u2009$a_n$, the colours the professor chose for the first $n$ cubes.\n\n-----Output:-----\nPrint a single line containing one integer $X$, the position Ali should initially stand on.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{6}$\n- $0 \\leq a_i \\leq 999$\n\n-----Sample Input 1:-----\n4\n\n3 3 8 8   \n\n-----Sample Output 1:-----\n3\n\n-----Sample Input 2:-----\n4\n\n2 8 7 3\n\n-----Sample Output 2:-----\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
