The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly N city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly N blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput will consist of a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum perimeter that can be achieved.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n11\n\nOutput\n14\n\nInput\n22\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nHere are some possible shapes for the examples:\n\n[Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
