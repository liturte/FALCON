Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food. \n\nIahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that\n\n  each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;  node i has c_{i} nodes in its subtree? \n\nIahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 24). Next line contains n positive integers: the i-th number represents c_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput on the first line \"YES\" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output \"NO\" (without quotes). \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 1 1 4\n\nOutput\nYES\nInput\n5\n1 1 5 2 1\n\nOutput\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
