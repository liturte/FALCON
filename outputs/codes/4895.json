You need to designate a \u201csafe zone\u201d, where, if the players manage to sneak there without being detected, they beat the seeker. It is therefore of utmost importance that this zone is well-chosen.\n\nYou point towards a tree as a suggestion, but your fellow hide-and-seekers are not satisfied. After all, the tree has branches stretching far and wide, and it will be difficult to determine whether a player has reached the safe zone. They want a very specific demarcation for the safe zone. So, you tell them to go and find some sticks, of which you will use three to mark a non-degenerate triangle (i.e.\u00a0with strictly positive area) next to the tree which will count as the safe zone. After a while they return with a variety of sticks, but you are unsure whether you can actually form a triangle with the available sticks.\n\nCan you write a program that determines whether you can make a triangle with exactly three of the collected sticks?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains a single integer $N$, with $3 \\leq N \\leq 20000$, the number of sticks collected. Then follows one line with $N$ positive integers, each less than $2^{60}$, the lengths of the sticks which your fellow campers have collected.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single line containing a single word: possible if you can make a non-degenerate triangle with three sticks of the provided lengths, and impossible if you can not.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n3\n1 1 1\nSample Output:\npossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
