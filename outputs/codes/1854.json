This time the graph you are asked to build should match the following properties.\n\nThe graph is connected if and only if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nThe diameter (aka \"longest shortest path\") of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.\n\nThe degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nGiven a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ construct a connected undirected graph of $n$ vertices such that:  the graph contains no self-loops and no multiple edges;  the degree $d_i$ of the $i$-th vertex doesn't exceed $a_i$ (i.e. $d_i \\le a_i$);  the diameter of the graph is maximum possible. \n\nOutput the resulting graph or report that no solution exists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 500$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n - 1$) \u2014 the upper limits to vertex degrees.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"NO\" if no graph can be constructed under the given conditions.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" and the diameter of the resulting graph in the first line.\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer $m$ \u2014 the number of edges in the resulting graph.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines should contain two integers $v_i, u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$, $v_i \\neq u_i$) \u2014 the description of the $i$-th edge.
