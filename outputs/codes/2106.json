These cities are located on a straight line, we'll denote them from left to right as c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}. The Old Peykan wants to travel from city c_1 to c_{n} using roads. There are (n - 1) one way roads, the i-th road goes from city c_{i} to city c_{i} + 1 and is d_{i} kilometers long.\n\nThe Old Peykan travels 1 kilometer in 1 hour and consumes 1 liter of fuel during this time.\n\nEach city c_{i} (except for the last city c_{n}) has a supply of s_{i} liters of fuel which immediately transfers to the Old Peykan if it passes the city or stays in it. This supply refreshes instantly k hours after it transfers. The Old Peykan can stay in a city for a while and fill its fuel tank many times. \n\nInitially (at time zero) the Old Peykan is at city c_1 and s_1 liters of fuel is transferred to it's empty tank from c_1's supply. The Old Peykan's fuel tank capacity is unlimited. Old Peykan can not continue its travel if its tank is emptied strictly between two cities.\n\nFind the minimum time the Old Peykan needs to reach city c_{n}.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers m and k (1 \u2264 m, k \u2264 1000). The value m specifies the number of roads between cities which is equal to n - 1.\n\nThe next line contains m space-separated integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{m} (1 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 1000) and the following line contains m space-separated integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m} (1 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 1000).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line of the output print a single integer \u2014 the minimum time required for The Old Peykan to reach city c_{n} from city c_1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 6\n1 2 5 2\n2 3 3 4\n\nOutput\n10\n\nInput\n2 3\n5 6\n5 5\n\nOutput\n14\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample above, the Old Peykan stays in c_1 for 3 hours.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
