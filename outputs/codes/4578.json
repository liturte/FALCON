These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.\nNow, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:\n - For each of the N kinds of doughnuts, make at least one doughnut of that kind.\nAt most how many doughnuts can be made here? She does not necessarily need to consume all of her Moto. Also, under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to obey the condition.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 2 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n - 1 \u2264 m_i \u2264 1000\n - m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_N \u2264 X \u2264 10^5\n - All values in input are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\nm_1\nm_2\n:\nm_N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the maximum number of doughnuts that can be made under the condition.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3 1000\n120\n100\n140\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n9\n\nShe has 1000 grams of Moto and can make three kinds of doughnuts. If she makes one doughnut for each of the three kinds, she consumes 120 + 100 + 140 = 360 grams of Moto. From the 640 grams of Moto that remains here, she can make additional six Doughnuts 2. This is how she can made a total of nine doughnuts, which is the maximum.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
