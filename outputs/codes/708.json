Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.\n\nBear Limak was once in a city a and he wanted to go to a city b. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally:   There is no road between a and b.  There exists a sequence (path) of n distinct cities v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} that v_1 = a, v_{n} = b and there is a road between v_{i} and v_{i} + 1 for $i \\in \\{1,2, \\ldots, n - 1 \\}$. \n\nOn the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city c and a city d. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of n distinct cities u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n} that u_1 = c, u_{n} = d and there is a road between u_{i} and u_{i} + 1 for $i \\in \\{1,2, \\ldots, n - 1 \\}$.\n\nAlso, Limak thinks that there are at most k roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.\n\nGiven n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v_1, ..., v_{n}) and (u_1, ..., u_{n}) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, n - 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2n - 2)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 \u2264 a, b, c, d \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} where v_1 = a and v_{n} = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n} where u_1 = c and u_{n} = d.\n\nTwo paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), ..., (v_{n} - 1, v_{n}), (u_1, u_2), (u_2, u_3), ..., (u_{n} - 1, u_{n}). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 11\n2 4 7 3\n\nOutput\n2 7 1 3 6 5 4\n7 1 5 4 6 2 3\n\nInput\n1000 999\n10 20 30 40\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.\n\n [Image]\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
