Drazil is sending a list of commands through Wi-Fi to Dreamoon's smartphone and Dreamoon follows them.\n\nEach command is one of the following two types:   Go 1 unit towards the positive direction, denoted as '+'  Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' \n\nBut the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). \n\nYou are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a string s_1 \u2014 the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}. \n\nThe second line contains a string s_2 \u2014 the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command.\n\nLengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single real number corresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 9}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n++-+-\n+-+-+\n\nOutput\n1.000000000000\n\nInput\n+-+-\n+-??\n\nOutput\n0.500000000000\n\nInput\n+++\n??-\n\nOutput\n0.000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, both s_1 and s_2 will lead Dreamoon to finish at the same position  + 1. \n\nFor the second sample, s_1 will lead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for s_2: {\"+-++\", \"+-+-\", \"+--+\", \"+---\"} with ending position {+2, 0, 0, -2} respectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5. \n\nFor the third sample, s_2 could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position  + 3 is 0.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
