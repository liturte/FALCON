Are you busy? Will you save us?\".\n\nShe wants to let more people know about it, so she defines f_{i} =  \"What are you doing while sending \"f_{i} - 1\"? Are you busy? Will you send \"f_{i} - 1\"?\" for all i \u2265 1.\n\nFor example, f_1 is\n\n\"What are you doing while sending \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\"? Are you busy? Will you send \"What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?\"?\". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of f_1.\n\nIt can be seen that the characters in f_{i} are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.\n\nNephren will ask the little leprechauns q times. Each time she will let them find the k-th character of f_{n}. The characters are indexed starting from 1. If f_{n} consists of less than k characters, output '.' (without quotes).\n\nCan you answer her queries?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Nephren's questions.\n\nEach of the next q lines describes Nephren's question and contains two integers n and k (0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^18).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOne line containing q characters.
