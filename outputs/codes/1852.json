Let's define following tree generation as McDic's generation:  Make a complete and full binary tree of $2^{n} - 1$ vertices. Complete and full binary tree means a tree that exactly one vertex is a root, all leaves have the same depth (distance from the root), and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two child nodes.  Select a non-root vertex $v$ from that binary tree.  Remove $v$ from tree and make new edges between $v$'s parent and $v$'s direct children. If $v$ has no children, then no new edges will be made. \n\nYou have a tree. Determine if this tree can be made by McDic's generation. If yes, then find the parent vertex of removed vertex in tree.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 17$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $2^{n} - 3$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \\le a_{i} \\lt b_{i} \\le 2^{n} - 2$)\u00a0\u2014 meaning there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two lines.\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of answers. If given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then print $0$.\n\nIn the second line, print all possible answers in ascending order, separated by spaces. If the given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then don't print anything.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 13\n3 14\n4 7\n4 8\n5 9\n5 10\n6 11\n6 12\n\nOutput\n1\n3\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 2\n\nInput\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, $3$ is the only possible answer. $8$ \n\nIn the second example, there are $2$ possible answers.
