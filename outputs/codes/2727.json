For every $i > 1$, let $g_ i$ be the leftmost integer in $A$ that is strictly larger than $g_{i-1}$. If for a given $i$ there is no such integer, we say that the GIS of the sequence is the sequence $(g_1, g_2, ..., g_{i - 1})$.\n\nFor example, consider the permutation $(2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6)$. First, we have $g_1 = 2$. The leftmost integer larger than $2$ is $3$, so $g_2 = 3$. The leftmost integer larger than $3$ is $5$ ($1$ is too small), so $g_3 = 5$. Finally, $g_4 = 7$. Thus, the GIS of $(2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6)$ is $(2, 3, 5, 7)$.\n\nGiven a sequence $G = (g_1, g_2, \\dots , g_ L)$, how many permutations $A$ of the integers $1, 2, \\dots , N$ have $G$ as its GIS?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integers $1 \\le N \\le 10^6$, the number of elements of the permutation $A$, and $1 \\le L \\le 10^6$, the length of the sequence $G$.\n\nThe next line contains $L$ positive integers between $1$ and $N$, the elements $g_1, \\dots , g_ L$ of the sequence $G$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer: the number of $N$-element permutations having the given sequence as its GIS. Since this number may be large, output it modulo the prime number $10^9 + 7$.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 1\n1\nSample Output 1:\n0\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 1\n5\nSample Output 2:\n24\n\nSample Input 3:\n5 3\n2 4 5\nSample Output 3:\n8\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
