Such a beautiful day! He notices that the clouds are particularly beautiful today, and wishes to record the current state of the sky. He has no camera, so he begins writing down coordinate points. Fortunately for Garry, the current cloud cover can be represented as the union of non-intersecting, non-degenerate triangles where each vertex is at a coordinate point on the $xy$-plane. Two triangles are considered non-intersecting if their intersection has area $0$. A triangle is degenerate if its area is $0$.\n\nThe next day, Garry\u2019s friend Jerry goes to look at the sky. Jerry also wishes to record the current state of the sky. He follows the same protocol as Garry, and writes down the cloud cover as a set of non-intersecting triangles.\n\nGarry and Jerry want to determine if they saw the same cloud cover. Unfortunately, there are multiple possible ways to represent the same cloud cover! Given Garry and Jerry\u2019s notes, did they see the same cloud cover in the sky?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the integer $n$, $(0 \\le n \\le 100000)$, the number of triangles Garry wrote down. Each of the next $n$ lines contains $6$ space separated integers, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, $x_3$, and $y_3$. These are Garry\u2019s triangles. The next line contains the integer $m$, $(0 \\le m \\le 100000)$, the number of triangles Jerry wrote down. Each of the next $m$ lines contains $6$ space separated integers, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, $x_3$, and $y_3$. These are Jerry\u2019s triangles. The absolute value of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are at most $10^9$. (That\u2019s as far as Garry and Jerry can see.)\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint \u201cyes\u201d if Garry and Jerry saw the same cloud cover, or \u201cno\u201d if they did not.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1\n10000 0 10000 10000 0 10000\n3\n10000 0 10000 10000 5000 5000\n5000 5000 10000 10000 0 10000\n0 0 0 1000 1000 0\nSample Output 1:\nno\n\nSample Input 2:\n2\n9996 0 9997 0 0 1\n9999 0 10000 0 0 1\n2\n9997 0 9998 0 0 1\n9998 0 9999 0 0 1\nSample Output 2:\nno\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
