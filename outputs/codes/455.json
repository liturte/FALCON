The sections are numbered 1, 2, ..., m, and the joints are numbered 0, 1, ..., m. Section i connects Joint i-1 and Joint i. The length of Section i is d_i.\n - For each section, its mode can be specified individually. There are four modes: L, R, D and U. The mode of a section decides the direction of that section. If we consider the factory as a coordinate plane, the position of Joint i will be determined as follows (we denote its coordinates as (x_i, y_i)):\n - (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0).\n - If the mode of Section i is L, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} - d_{i}, y_{i-1}).\n - If the mode of Section i is R, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} + d_{i}, y_{i-1}).\n - If the mode of Section i is D, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} - d_{i}).\n - If the mode of Section i is U, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} + d_{i}).\nSnuke would like to introduce a robot arm so that the position of Joint m can be matched with all of the N points (X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_N, Y_N) by properly specifying the modes of the sections.\nIs this possible?\nIf so, find such a robot arm and how to bring Joint m to each point (X_j, Y_j).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - All values in input are integers.\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 1000\n - -10^9 \\leq X_i \\leq 10^9\n - -10^9 \\leq Y_i \\leq 10^9\n\n-----Partial Score-----\n - In the test cases worth 300 points, -10 \\leq X_i \\leq 10 and -10 \\leq Y_i \\leq 10 hold.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nX_1 Y_1\nX_2 Y_2\n:\nX_N Y_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf the condition can be satisfied, follow the following format.

Also, m and d_i must all be integers.\nw_j is a string of length m that represents the way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to point (X_j, Y_j).\nThe i-th character of w_j should be one of the letters L, R, D and U, representing the mode of Section i.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n3\n-1 0\n0 3\n2 -1\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n1 2\nRL\nUU\nDR\n\nIn the given way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to each (X_j, Y_j), the positions of the joints will be as follows:\n - To (X_1, Y_1) = (-1, 0): First, the position of Joint 0 is (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0). As the mode of Section 1 is R, the position of Joint 1 is (x_1, y_1) = (1, 0). Then, as the mode of Section 2 is L, the position of Joint 2 is (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 0).\n - To (X_2, Y_2) = (0, 3): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, 1), (x_2, y_2) = (0, 3).\n - To (X_3, Y_3) = (2, -1): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, -1), (x_2, y_2) = (2, -1).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
