They should stand in a line so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 to n + m. Then the number of integers i (1 \u2264 i < n + m) such that positions with indexes i and i + 1 contain children of different genders (position i has a girl and position i + 1 has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible. \n\nHelp the children and tell them how to form the line.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe single line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100), separated by a space.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a line of n + m characters. Print on the i-th position of the line character \"B\", if the i-th position of your arrangement should have a boy and \"G\", if it should have a girl. \n\nOf course, the number of characters \"B\" should equal n and the number of characters \"G\" should equal m. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3\n\nOutput\nGBGBGB\n\nInput\n4 2\n\nOutput\nBGBGBB\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample another possible answer is BGBGBG. \n\nIn the second sample answer BBGBGB is also optimal.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
