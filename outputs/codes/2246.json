But the weather is foggy, so they can\u2019t see where the horse brings them. When the horse reaches a city (including the first one), it goes to one of the cities connected to the current city. But it is a strange horse, it only goes to cities in which they weren't before. In each such city, the horse goes with equal probabilities and it stops when there are no such cities. \n\nLet the length of each road be 1. The journey starts in the city 1. What is the expected length (expected value of length) of their journey? You can read about expected (average) value by the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000)\u00a0\u2014 number of cities.\n\nThen n - 1 lines follow. The i-th line of these lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i})\u00a0\u2014 the cities connected by the i-th road.\n\nIt is guaranteed that one can reach any city from any other by the roads.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a number\u00a0\u2014 the expected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n1.500000000000000\n\nInput\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 5\n\nOutput\n2.000000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, their journey may end in cities 3 or 4 with equal probability. The distance to city 3 is 1 and to city 4 is 2, so the expected length is 1.5.\n\nIn the second sample, their journey may end in city 4 or 5. The distance to the both cities is 2, so the expected length is 2.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
