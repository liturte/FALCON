The only containers he has are a set of large bottles (each with the same volume) and a set of smaller bottles (also each with the same, but smaller volume). Given the volume of the shipment of oil, he would like to store the oil in the bottles so that\n - all of the oil is stored,\n - each bottle is filled to the top, and\n - the minimum number of bottles is used.\n\nWhile Peter thinks he has solved this problem for his given bottle sizes, he often spends hours wondering what would happen if his bottles had different volumes (apparently Peter doesn\u2019t lead the most exciting life).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of a single line containing three positive integers $s$$v_1$ $v_2$, where $s \\leq 10^6$ is the volume of the shipment, and $v_1, v_2 \\leq 10^6$ are the volumes of the two types of bottles, with $v_1 > v_2$.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the number of bottles of size $v_1$ and the number of bottles of size $v_2$ which satisfy Peter\u2019s two conditions. If the conditions cannot be met, output Impossible.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n1000 9 7\nSample Output 1:\n108 4\n\nSample Input 2:\n1000 900 7\nSample Output 2:\nImpossible\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
