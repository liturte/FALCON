The house has n apartments that are numbered from 1 to n and are arranged in a row. Two apartments are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Some of the apartments can already be inhabited, others are available for sale.\n\nMaxim often visits his neighbors, so apartment is good for him if it is available for sale and there is at least one already inhabited apartment adjacent to it. Maxim knows that there are exactly k already inhabited apartments, but he doesn't know their indices yet.\n\nFind out what could be the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments that are good for Maxim.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers: n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments good for Maxim.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6 3\n\nOutput\n1 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the sample test, the number of good apartments could be minimum possible if, for example, apartments with indices 1, 2 and 3 were inhabited. In this case only apartment 4 is good. The maximum possible number could be, for example, if apartments with indices 1, 3 and 5 were inhabited. In this case all other apartments: 2, 4 and 6 are good.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
