The Painter and the three little hedgehogs now have to return to the Beaver\u2019s den where they will be safe from the water as quickly as possible!\n\nThe map of the Enchanted Forest consists of R rows and C columns. Empty fields are represented by \u2018.\u2019 characters, flooded fields by \u2018*\u2019 and rocks by \u2018X\u2019. Additionally, the Beaver\u2019s den is represented by \u2018D\u2019 and the Painter and the three little hedgehogs are shown as \u2018S\u2019.\n\nEvery minute the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can move to one of the four neighbouring fields (up, down, left or right). Every minute the flood expands as well so that all empty fields that have at least one common side with a flooded field become flooded as well. Neither water nor the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can pass through rocks. Naturally, the Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot pass through flooded fields, and water cannot flood the Beaver\u2019s den.\n\nWrite a program that will, given a map of the Enchanted Forest, output the shortest time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver\u2019s den.\n\nNote: The Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot move into a field that is about to be flooded (in the same minute).\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input will contain two positive integers, $R$ and $C$, smaller than or equal to $50$. The following $R$ lines will each contain $C$ characters (\u2018.\u2019, \u2018*\u2019, \u2018X\u2019, \u2018D\u2019 or \u2018S\u2019). The map will contain exactly one \u2018D\u2019 character and exactly one \u2018S\u2019 character.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the shortest possible time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver\u2019s den. If this is impossible output the word \u201cKAKTUS\u201d on a line by itself.\n\nClarification of the second sample test below: The best they can do is to go along the lower border and then the left border, and get flooded one minute before reaching the den.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\nD.*\n...\n.S.\nSample Output 1:\n3\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 3\nD.*\n...\n..S\nSample Output 2:\nKAKTUS\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
