A small cinema has been selected to show these early screenings. \n\nThere are $n$ critics numbered from $1$ to $n$ scheduled to watch the movie early, and each of them will watch it separately. After watching it, they will immediately give it a score from $0$ to $m$. Susan, the cinema owner, has carefully looked at every critic\u2019s social media and already knows that the $i$th critic thinks the movie is worth a score of $a_ i$. However, the $i$th critic will not simply give the movie a score of $a_ i$ like you would expect, because they also take into account the scores that the other critics gave. Here is how they behave:\n - The first critic to arrive will be so happy that they are the first to review the movie that they will give it a score of $m$ regardless of their initial opinion.\n - Every subsequent critic will look at the average score given by the previous critics. If this number is smaller than or equal to the initial opinion $a_ i$ then the critic will give it a score of $m$, otherwise they will give it a $0$.\n\nSusan thinks the critics\u2019 behaviour is ridiculous. She has watched the movie, and it is clearly worth a score of exactly $k/n$ and nothing else! But Susan is the owner of the cinema, so she gets to decide in what order to invite the critics. Your task is to find a permutation of $1,2, \\dots , n$ so that if the critics arrive in this order the average score will be exactly $k/n$.Input\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 10^4$, $0 \\leq k \\leq n \\cdot m$). The second line contains the $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ n$ ($0 \\le a_ i \\le m$ for each $i$), the $n$ critic scores as described above.Output\n\nIf the critics can be ordered in such a way that the resulting average score is exactly $k/n$, then output $n$ integers $p_1, \\ldots , p_ n$ ($1 \\le p_ i \\le n$), where $p_ i$ indicates that the $i$th critic to visit the cinema is the critic numbered $p_ i$. This list of integers should be a permutation such that the average score given by the critics is $k/n$. If there are multiple solutions any one will be accepted.\n\nOtherwise, if there is no such way to order the critics, output \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n5 10 30\n10 5 3 1 3\nSample Output:\n3 5 2 1 4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
