If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...\n\nThe order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.\n\nDuring the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. \n\nIf there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^18, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 3 8 1 1\n\nOutput\n3 2 3\nInput\n4 2 9 4 2\n\nOutput\n2 1 1\nInput\n5 5 25 4 3\n\nOutput\n1 1 1\nInput\n100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100\n\nOutput\n101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; \n\nThe order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
