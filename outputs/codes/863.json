A bus from the city A departs every a minutes and arrives to the city B in a t_{a} minutes, and a bus from the city B departs every b minutes and arrives to the city A in a t_{b} minutes.\n\nThe driver Simion wants to make his job diverse, so he counts the buses going towards him. Simion doesn't count the buses he meet at the start and finish.\n\nYou know the time when Simion departed from the city A to the city B. Calculate the number of buses Simion will meet to be sure in his counting.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers a, t_{a} (1 \u2264 a, t_{a} \u2264 120) \u2014 the frequency of the buses from the city A to the city B and the travel time. Both values are given in minutes.\n\nThe second line contains two integers b, t_{b} (1 \u2264 b, t_{b} \u2264 120) \u2014 the frequency of the buses from the city B to the city A and the travel time. Both values are given in minutes.\n\nThe last line contains the departure time of Simion from the city A in the format hh:mm. It is guaranteed that there are a bus from the city A at that time. Note that the hours and the minutes are given with exactly two digits.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer z \u2014 the number of buses Simion will meet on the way. Note that you should not count the encounters in cities A and B.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 30\n10 35\n05:20\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n60 120\n24 100\n13:00\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Simion departs form the city A at 05:20 AM and arrives to the city B at 05:50 AM. He will meet the first 5 buses from the city B that departed in the period [05:00 AM - 05:40 AM]. Also Simion will meet a bus in the city B at 05:50 AM, but he will not count it.\n\nAlso note that the first encounter will be between 05:26 AM and 05:27 AM (if we suggest that the buses are go with the sustained speed).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
