An unlikely sequence of mutations has resulted in a DNA strand consisting only of $A$\u2019s. Biologists found that very odd, so they began studying the mutations in greater detail.\n\nThey discovered two types of mutations. One type results in changing any single character of the sequence ($A \\rightarrow B$ or $B \\rightarrow A$). The second type changes a whole prefix of the sequence, specifically replacing all characters in positions from $1$ to $K$ (for some $K$ between $1$ and $N$, inclusive) with the other character ($A$ with $B$, $B$ with $A$).\n\nCompute the least possible number of mutations that could convert the starting molecule to its end state (containing only $A$ characters). Mutations can occur in any order.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 1000000$), the length of the molecule. The second line of input contains a string with $N$ characters, with each character being either $A$ or $B$. This string represents the starting state of the molecule.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of mutations.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n4\nABBA\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n5\nBBABB\nSample Output 2:\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
