The survey team has picked a route and has entrusted you with the job of transmitting the final set of instructions to the rover. This route is simply a sequence of moves in the cardinal directions: North, South, East, and West. These instructions can be sent using a string of corresponding characters: N, S, E, and W. However, receiving the signal drains the rover\u2019s power supply, which is already dangerously low. Fortunately, the rover\u2019s creators built in the ability for you to optionally define a single \u201cmacro\u201d that can be used if the route has a lot of repetition. More concretely, to send a message with a macro, two strings are sent. The first is over the characters {N,S,E,W,M} and the second is over {N,S,E,W}. The first string represents a sequence of moves and calls to a macro (M), while the second string determines what the macro expands out to. For example:WNMWMME\n\n EEN\n\nis an encoding ofWNEENWEENEENE\n\nNotice that the version with macros requires only $10$ characters, whereas the original requires $13$.\n\nGiven a route, determine the minimum number of characters needed to transmit it to the rover.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput consists of a single line containing a non-empty string made up of the letters N, S, E, and W representing the route to transmit to the rover. The maximum length of the string is $100$.\n\n-----Input-----\nDisplay the minimum number of characters needed to encode the route.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\nWNEENWEENEENE\nSample Output 1:\n10\n\nSample Input 2:\nNSEW\nSample Output 2:\n4\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
