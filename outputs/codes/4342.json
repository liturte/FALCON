It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.\n\nYou choose an edge and remove it from the tree. Tree falls apart into two connected components. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contain vertices of both red and blue colors.\n\nHow many nice edges are there in the given tree?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 2$) \u2014 the colors of the vertices. $a_i = 1$ means that vertex $i$ is colored red, $a_i = 2$ means that vertex $i$ is colored blue and $a_i = 0$ means that vertex $i$ is uncolored.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$, $v_i \\ne u_i$) \u2014 the edges of the tree.

Removing it makes the tree fall apart into components $\\{4\\}$ and $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$. The first component only includes a red vertex and the second component includes blue vertices and uncolored vertices.\n\nHere is the tree from the second example: [Image] \n\nEvery edge is nice in it.\n\nHere is the tree from the third example: [Image] \n\nEdge $(1, 3)$ splits the into components $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{3, 2\\}$, the latter one includes both red and blue vertex, thus the edge isn't nice. Edge $(2, 3)$ splits the into components $\\{1, 3\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$, the former one includes both red and blue vertex, thus the edge also isn't nice.
