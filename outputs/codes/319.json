The i-th switch turns on some subset of the lamps. This information is given as the matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns where a_{i}, j = 1 if the i-th switch turns on the j-th lamp and a_{i}, j = 0 if the i-th switch is not connected to the j-th lamp.\n\nInitially all m lamps are turned off.\n\nSwitches change state only from \"off\" to \"on\". It means that if you press two or more switches connected to the same lamp then the lamp will be turned on after any of this switches is pressed and will remain its state even if any switch connected to this lamp is pressed afterwards.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if you push all n switches then all m lamps will be turned on.\n\nYour think that you have too many switches and you would like to ignore one of them. \n\nYour task is to say if there exists such a switch that if you will ignore (not use) it but press all the other n - 1 switches then all the m lamps will be turned on.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of the switches and the number of the lamps.\n\nThe following n lines contain m characters each. The character a_{i}, j is equal to '1' if the i-th switch turns on the j-th lamp and '0' otherwise.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if you press all n switches all m lamps will be turned on.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" if there is a switch that if you will ignore it and press all the other n - 1 switches then all m lamps will be turned on. Print \"NO\" if there is no such switch.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n10101\n01000\n00111\n10000\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n4 5\n10100\n01000\n00110\n00101\n\nOutput\nNO\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
