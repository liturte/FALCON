As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions:   take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color. \n\nShe repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of cards.\n\nThe next line contains a string s of length n \u2014 the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single string of up to three characters\u00a0\u2014 the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\nRB\n\nOutput\nG\n\nInput\n3\nGRG\n\nOutput\nBR\n\nInput\n5\nBBBBB\n\nOutput\nB\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Catherine has one red card and one blue card, which she must exchange for a green card.\n\nIn the second sample, Catherine has two green cards and one red card. She has two options: she can exchange the two green cards for a green card, then exchange the new green card and the red card for a blue card. Alternatively, she can exchange a green and a red card for a blue card, then exchange the blue card and remaining green card for a red card.\n\nIn the third sample, Catherine only has blue cards, so she can only exchange them for more blue cards.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
