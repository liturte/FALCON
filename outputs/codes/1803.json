There are n horizontal electricity wires aligned parallel to each other. Wires are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom. On each wire there are some oskols sitting next to each other. Oskol is the name of a delicious kind of birds in Shaass's territory. Supposed there are a_{i} oskols sitting on the i-th wire. $40$ \n\nSometimes Shaass shots one of the birds and the bird dies (suppose that this bird sat at the i-th wire). Consequently all the birds on the i-th wire to the left of the dead bird get scared and jump up on the wire number i - 1, if there exists no upper wire they fly away. Also all the birds to the right of the dead bird jump down on wire number i + 1, if there exists no such wire they fly away. \n\nShaass has shot m birds. You're given the initial number of birds on each wire, tell him how many birds are sitting on each wire after the shots.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). The next line contains a list of space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100). \n\nThe third line contains an integer m, (0 \u2264 m \u2264 100). Each of the next m lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i}. The integers mean that for the i-th time Shaass shoot the y_{i}-th (from left) bird on the x_{i}-th wire, (1 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_{i}). It's guaranteed there will be at least y_{i} birds on the x_{i}-th wire at that moment.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the i-th line of the output print the number of birds on the i-th wire.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n10 10 10 10 10\n5\n2 5\n3 13\n2 12\n1 13\n4 6\n\nOutput\n0\n12\n5\n0\n16\n\nInput\n3\n2 4 1\n1\n2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n0\n3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
