Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \\le x \\le r_i$.\n\nUnfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.\n\nYou want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \\le n, q \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.\n\nThen $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 maximum number of painted sections if you hire $q - 2$ painters.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 5\n1 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n3 5\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n4 3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 4\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 4\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput\n3\nUse Standard Input format\n\nContext of relevant code:\n- Historical Task: \nQUESTION:\nYou've been in love with Coronavirus-chan for a long time, but you didn't know where she lived until now. And just now you found out that she lives in a faraway place called Naha. \n\nYou immediately decided to take a vacation and visit Coronavirus-chan. Your vacation lasts exactly $x$ days and that's the exact number of days you will spend visiting your friend. You will spend exactly $x$ consecutive (successive) days visiting Coronavirus-chan.\n\nThey use a very unusual calendar in Naha: there are $n$ months in a year, $i$-th month lasts exactly $d_i$ days. Days in the $i$-th month are numbered from $1$ to $d_i$. There are no leap years in Naha.\n\nThe mood of Coronavirus-chan (and, accordingly, her desire to hug you) depends on the number of the day in a month. In particular, you get $j$ hugs if you visit Coronavirus-chan on the $j$-th day of the month.\n\nYou know about this feature of your friend and want to plan your trip to get as many hugs as possible (and then maybe you can win the heart of Coronavirus-chan). \n\nPlease note that your trip should not necessarily begin and end in the same year.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of months in the year and the number of days you can spend with your friend.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$, $d_i$ is the number of days in the $i$-th month ($1 \\le d_i \\le 10^6$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that $1 \\le x \\le d_1 + d_2 + \\ldots + d_n$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum number of hugs that you can get from Coronavirus-chan during the best vacation in your life.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 3 1\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n3 6\n3 3 3\n\nOutput\n12\nInput\n5 6\n4 2 3 1 3\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the numbers of the days in a year are (indices of days in a corresponding month) $\\{1,1,2,3,1\\}$. Coronavirus-chan will hug you the most if you come on the third day of the year: $2+3=5$ hugs.\n\nIn the second test case, the numbers of the days are $\\{1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3\\}$. You will get the most hugs if you arrive on the third day of the year: $3+1+2+3+1+2=12$ hugs.\n\nIn the third test case, the numbers of the days are $\\{1,2,3,4,1,2, 1,2,3, 1, 1,2,3\\}$. You will get the most hugs if you come on the twelfth day of the year: your friend will hug you $2+3+1+2+3+4=15$ times.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n\n- Code: \n- Style Score: 1\n- Efficiency Score: 1\n- Instruction Following Score: 1\n\nRequirements:\n1.
