In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \u2014 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \u2014 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \u2014 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings\u00a0\u2014 the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1s 2s 3s\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n9m 9m 9m\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3p 9m 2p\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.\n\nIn the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.\n\nIn the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile\u00a0\u2014 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\nUse Standard Input format\n\nContext of relevant code:\n- Historical Task: \nQUESTION:\nOn his trip to Luxor and Aswan, Sagheer went to a Nubian market to buy some souvenirs for his friends and relatives. The market has some strange rules. It contains n different items numbered from 1 to n. The i-th item has base cost a_{i} Egyptian pounds. If Sagheer buys k items with indices x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}, then the cost of item x_{j} is a_{x}_{j} + x_{j}\u00b7k for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. In other words, the cost of an item is equal to its base cost in addition to its index multiplied by the factor k.\n\nSagheer wants to buy as many souvenirs as possible without paying more than S Egyptian pounds. Note that he cannot buy a souvenir more than once. If there are many ways to maximize the number of souvenirs, he will choose the way that will minimize the total cost. Can you help him with this task?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and S (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5 and 1 \u2264 S \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of souvenirs in the market and Sagheer's budget.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the base costs of the souvenirs.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn a single line, print two integers k, T\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of souvenirs Sagheer can buy and the minimum total cost to buy these k souvenirs.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 11\n2 3 5\n\nOutput\n2 11\n\nInput\n4 100\n1 2 5 6\n\nOutput\n4 54\n\nInput\n1 7\n7\n\nOutput\n0 0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, he cannot take the three items because they will cost him [5, 9, 14] with total cost 28. If he decides to take only two items, then the costs will be [4, 7, 11]. So he can afford the first and second items.\n\nIn the second example, he can buy all items as they will cost him [5, 10, 17, 22].\n\nIn the third example, there is only one souvenir in the market which will cost him 8 pounds, so he cannot buy it.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n\n- Code: \n- Style Score: 0\n- Efficiency Score: 2\n- Instruction Following Score: -1\n\nRequirements:\n1.
