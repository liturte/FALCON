Year is considered lucky if it has no more than 1 non-zero digit in its number. So years 100, 40000, 5 are lucky and 12, 3001 and 12345 are not.\n\nYou are given current year in Berland. Your task is to find how long will residents of Berland wait till the next lucky year.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2014 current year in Berland.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput amount of years from the current year to the next lucky one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n201\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n4000\n\nOutput\n1000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example next lucky year is 5. In the second one \u2014 300. In the third \u2014 5000.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n\n- Code: \n- Style Score: 1\n- Efficiency Score: 2\n- Instruction Following Score: 1\n\nRequirements:\n1.
