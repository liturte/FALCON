Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?\n\nFortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!\n\nThe storehouse is represented as matrix n \u00d7 m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.\n\nSofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. \n\nNote that in all conditions A \u2260 B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.\n\nThe note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} \u2014 to the right, cnt_{t} \u2014 to the top and cnt_{b} \u2014 to the bottom.\n\nGrandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.\n\nOutput the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of sofas in the storehouse.\n\nThe second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the storehouse.\n\nNext d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1, x_2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_1, y_2 \u2264 m) \u2014 coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  \u2260  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.\n\nThe last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 \u2264 cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} \u2264 d - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n3 2\n3 1 3 2\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n10 10\n1 2 1 1\n5 5 6 5\n6 4 5 4\n2 1 2 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n2 2\n2 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. \n\nSo the second one corresponds to the given conditions.\n\nIn the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. \n\nAnd there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.\nUse Standard Input format\n\nContext of relevant code:\n- Historical Task: \nQUESTION:\nInnovation technologies are on a victorious march around the planet. They integrate into all spheres of human activity!\n\nA restaurant called \"Dijkstra's Place\" has started thinking about optimizing the booking system. \n\nThere are n booking requests received by now. Each request is characterized by two numbers: c_{i} and p_{i} \u2014 the size of the group of visitors who will come via this request and the total sum of money they will spend in the restaurant, correspondingly.\n\nWe know that for each request, all c_{i} people want to sit at the same table and are going to spend the whole evening in the restaurant, from the opening moment at 18:00 to the closing moment.\n\nUnfortunately, there only are k tables in the restaurant. For each table, we know r_{i} \u2014 the maximum number of people who can sit at it. A table can have only people from the same group sitting at it. If you cannot find a large enough table for the whole group, then all visitors leave and naturally, pay nothing.\n\nYour task is: given the tables and the requests, decide which requests to accept and which requests to decline so that the money paid by the happy and full visitors was maximum.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of requests from visitors. Then n lines follow. Each line contains two integers: c_{i}, p_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i}, p_{i} \u2264 1000) \u2014 the size of the group of visitors who will come by the i-th request and the total sum of money they will pay when they visit the restaurant, correspondingly.\n\nThe next line contains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of tables in the restaurant. The last line contains k space-separated integers: r_1, r_2, ..., r_{k} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 1000) \u2014 the maximum number of people that can sit at each table.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print two integers: m, s \u2014 the number of accepted requests and the total money you get from these requests, correspondingly.\n\nThen print m lines \u2014 each line must contain two space-separated integers: the number of the accepted request and the number of the table to seat people who come via this request. The requests and the tables are consecutively numbered starting from 1 in the order in which they are given in the input.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n10 50\n2 100\n5 30\n3\n4 6 9\n\nOutput\n2 130\n2 1\n3 2\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n\n- Code: \n- Style Score: 2\n- Efficiency Score: 2\n- Instruction Following Score: 2\n\nRequirements:\n1.
