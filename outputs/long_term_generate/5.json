She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.\n\nEach second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 pos \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 3 2 4\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n6 3 1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5 2 1 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.\n\nIn the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.\n\nIn the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\nUse Standard Input format\n\nContext of relevant code:\n- Historical Task: \nQUESTION:\nThere are times you recall a good old friend and everything you've come through together. Luckily there are social networks\u00a0\u2014 they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago.\n\nMore formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from 1 to n where n is the total number of messages in the chat.\n\nEach message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message x or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that k previous messages, message x and k next messages are visible (with respect to message x). In case there are less than k messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.\n\nDigging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message x (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.\n\nDetermine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number t for all t from 1 to n. Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message x, the initial configuration is x itself, k previous and k next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the total amount of messages and the number of previous and next messages visible.\n\nThe second line features a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 \u2264 a_{i} < i), where a_{i} denotes the i-th message link destination or zero, if there's no link from i. All messages are listed in chronological order. It's guaranteed that the link from message x goes to message with number strictly less than x.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n integers with i-th denoting the number of distinct messages you can read starting from message i and traversing the links while possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 0\n0 1 1 2 3 2\n\nOutput\n1 2 2 3 3 3 \n\nInput\n10 1\n0 1 0 3 4 5 2 3 7 0\n\nOutput\n2 3 3 4 5 6 6 6 8 2 \n\nInput\n2 2\n0 1\n\nOutput\n2 2 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider i = 6 in sample case one. You will read message 6, then 2, then 1 and then there will be no link to go.\n\nIn the second sample case i = 6 gives you messages 5, 6, 7 since k = 1, then 4, 5, 6, then 2, 3, 4 and then the link sequence breaks. The number of distinct messages here is equal to 6.\nPlease provide the solution as pure code only, without explanations or comments.\n\nANSWER:\n```python\n\n- Code: \n- Style Score: 0\n- Efficiency Score: -1\n- Instruction Following Score: 1\n\nRequirements:\n1.
